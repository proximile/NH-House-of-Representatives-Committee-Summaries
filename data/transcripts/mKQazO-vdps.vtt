00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 align:start position:0%
question on
 
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 align:start position:0%
I have a question uh representative lab
 
00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 align:start position:0%
would you have any problem if we would
 
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
follow this up with 540
 
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
your other
 
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 align:start position:0%
great because then respecting your time
 
00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.809 align:start position:0%
 
hey

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 align:start position:0%
hey
 
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
good morning represent Emerick and and
 
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
members of the uh division two finance
 
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is for the record
 
00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 align:start position:0%
Rick Ladd I come from Haverhill New
 
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here today to
 
00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
introduce uh the house bill 364 relative
 
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
to Transportation students attending
 
00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical Education Centers
 
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
I handed out some materials to you just
 
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
skip over that first sheet I didn't know
 
00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 align:start position:0%
how that got in there
 
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
however we have approximately 9 700 kids
 
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
participating in CTE programs uh here in
 
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 align:start position:0%
the state the majority of those students
 
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
participating 7 800 of those students
 
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 align:start position:0%
are in the CTE slash high school so
 
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
they're not having to be transported at
 
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
all the remainder of those students the
 
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
1900 students come from all the
 
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
different sending schools that are
 
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
sending to our 25 CTE centers and that's
 
00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 align:start position:0%
not including the five centers that we
 
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
have across the river in Vermont
 
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
starting way up at Canaan coming down to
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
to Bradford going on down the river down
 
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
in Norwich Bridal Brattleboro area those
 
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 align:start position:0%
Springfield those that they we send a
 
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 align:start position:0%
number of our students over to Vermont
 
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
for Career Technical education but we're
 
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
required for tuition monies and of
 
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
course the transportation one needs to
 
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
get there the second sheet though I I
 
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
just for your familiarity you may be
 
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
familiar with how we developed the
 
00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
transportation costs and how we provide
 
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
the tuition costs for CTE
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
the transportation formula is fairly
 
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
simple we provide to the schools at the
 
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
rate of 10 cents per pupil per mile
 
00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 align:start position:0%
that's how schools are identify the
 
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
amount of money they will receive from
 
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
the state for transportation from their
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
sending High School to this Center which
 
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
is providing the CTE training if in fact
 
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
they aren't transported by the school
 
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
vehicle at 10 cents per mile they are
 
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
afforded 25 cents per mile to juice
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
their own personal vehicle but that has
 
00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 align:start position:0%
to be approved by your local board uh
 
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
before that will even happen
 
00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 align:start position:0%
some districts find it's cheaper to do
 
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
it that way than to run the 66 passenger
 
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
yellow bus also some students are
 
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
finding that for example in my neck of
 
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
the woods where they go from Haverhill
 
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
Woods Woodsville area down to Bradford
 
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
which is Oxbow over in Vermont they
 
00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 align:start position:0%
oftentimes have work right there in
 
00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
Bradford following up on their CTE they
 
00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
just had so they can't get back and then
 
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
on the bus and then that so they drive
 
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
their own vehicle and and ties in with
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
an internship program from the CTE
 
00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.110 align:start position:0%
an internship program from the CTE
Center

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
Center
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
but the tuition part is also very much
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
linked to this seeing that we
 
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 align:start position:0%
appropriate nine million dollars a year
 
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
for tuition and transportation CT that's
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
what's been done for centuries around
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
here and uh once you elevate that cost
 
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
according to federal law you're stuck
 
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
with that elevated cost you can't go
 
00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 align:start position:0%
back down to a lesser amount
 
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
but the tuition is is much different
 
00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
because it comes out of the same formula
 
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
the first thing we do is we pay off the
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
transportation costs
 
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
out of that nine million bucks so boom
 
00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:01.979 align:start position:0%
there goes seven hundred thousand
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
dollars six hundred and eighty thousand
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
to seven hundred thousand dollars that's
 
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
transportation and that's not fully
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
funding where we need that's not the
 
00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419 align:start position:0%
actual cost of Transportation the actual
 
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
cost of transportation for these
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
districts you'd have to add in another
 
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
2.2 million dollars to it be above
 
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
roughly around 2.8 million dollars for
 
00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:23.819 align:start position:0%
actual Transportation costs
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
the tuition though is where we have to
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
deal with the remainder of the 8 million
 
00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
plus dollars that's left in that pot
 
00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
after two Transportation dollars leave
 
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
and it's based upon the formula you see
 
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
in the top of the page there we look at
 
00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:40.979 align:start position:0%
each district looks at their uh the the
 
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
receiving District looks at their doe 25
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
form and what's the what's the per pupil
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
cost for providing education in that
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
High School let's say it's twenty
 
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
then they take a percentage and it's a
 
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
multiplier that's between 20 and 40
 
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
percent you can look at the sheet below
 
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
this one right here you can see how that
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
filters out in terms of what percentage
 
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
various schools are using and that's a
 
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
decision of the local receiving school
 
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
they make that decision
 
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
then we also have a figure of three
 
00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:16.139 align:start position:0%
percent which is a differential uh per
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
RSA 188 e for capital reserve fund to
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
support the CTE Center remember that
 
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
receiving School the the one that's
 
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
hosting the CTE program doesn't receive
 
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
the monies that we're talking about in
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
this formula so they have through their
 
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
operating budget provide the Staffing
 
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
and all the associated needs to operate
 
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
that CTE Center so there are permitted
 
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
within this formula here to add that
 
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
three percent differential which can go
 
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
towards a future needs in terms of
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
running that particular Center
 
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
uh in transportation
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
um we we provide the amount that I
 
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
mentioned the 10 cents per mile per
 
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
pupil or the 25 cents but in tuition the
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
state pays for 75 uh of the the costs
 
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
but if there's more people transporting
 
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
now then and there are seeing that this
 
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
last year or so we enabled Nashua Exeter
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
and Manchester who are transporting
 
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:19.860 align:start position:0%
within their school district to a center
 
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
the law used to say that if you're
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
transporting to a receiving uh School
 
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
District CTE program you will receive
 
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
the transfer the the transportation we
 
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
changed that law so if you're in
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester and you're shipping kids five
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
miles across the city to a center then
 
00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
that's a cost and we want kids going
 
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
safely on a bus so we put in the formula
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
now that we also are going to fund these
 
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
additional students while an extra and
 
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
and Nashua that's going to amount to
 
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:50.220 align:start position:0%
another hundred thousand dollars a year
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
so we have not ever really improved the
 
00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:54.899 align:start position:0%
amount of money we're providing that's
 
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
why we wrote in legislation in priority
 
00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.220 align:start position:0%
years full funding for transportation
 
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
and that was passed and set in the law
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
that's in law right now
 
00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:06.899 align:start position:0%
so going on down the the I've been
 
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
working with the folks out at doe and to
 
00:10:14.329 --> 00:10:14.339 align:start position:0%
the with the CTE uh advisory Council
 
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
which is a very active group that meets
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
often and does a wonderful job with that
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
wanting to find out what are the actual
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
costs associated with transportation
 
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
and is this formula the what we have
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
right now based on the per pupil per
 
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
mile adequate the policy committee says
 
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
no it's not and we voted unanimously for
 
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
this bill to go forward we want to look
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
at what other states are doing funding
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
based upon the number of trips made the
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
type of vehicle used uh it costs a lot
 
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
less to run a van than it does a large
 
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
school bus
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
and so in the number of trips made per
 
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
day this is a formula used in many many
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
states and this bill allows for this to
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
occur after we've worked on this because
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education doesn't have
 
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
that data or information at this point
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
in time we haven't set a mileage rate
 
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
for buses or for Vans or for southern
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
means of transportation that has to be
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
done policy wise so that's why you'll
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
see on this bill I don't have it in
 
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
front of me a later date for the being
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
implemented because there's strong
 
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
policy decisions which have to be made
 
00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:26.339 align:start position:0%
and we need to move in that direction 10
 
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
cents a mile per pupil just does not cut
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
it in a district where I am where
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
they're on the bus for 30 to 40 minutes
 
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
just going to CTE Center and because of
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
this cost of Transportation of Labor the
 
00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:42.899 align:start position:0%
cost of us the maintenance all that it's
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
a lot more than 10 cents per mile per
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
pupil when you only have four six four
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
to six kids participating and when in
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
fact they can't have more participating
 
00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:53.339 align:start position:0%
because they're not receiving adequate
 
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
funding for the CTE program from the
 
00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
formula we have right now so some school
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
districts are intentionally capping the
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
number of students the opportunity for
 
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
students to go from the sending school
 
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
to the receiving Center because they
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
don't have the funding it's not coming
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
by way of this formula we have set up
 
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
the sheet that you see it says CT
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
Transportation cost First reimbursement
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
is from Timberlane Regional School
 
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
District when I looked at this and
 
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
worked with uh Mr beard over at Jeff
 
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
over at the doe and even doing it this
 
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:30.660 align:start position:0%
weekend it turns out the money that
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
they're receiving in Timberline only
 
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:35.700 align:start position:0%
pays for 24 percent
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
of the transportation costs
 
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
so if we were to take that same 24
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
percent and build it over the entire
 
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
state budget we are shallow 2.2 million
 
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.750 align:start position:0%
state budget we are shallow 2.2 million
dollars

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
in in this you can take that same
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
formula and work with the tuition as
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
well on the tuition formula there's
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
another sheet which is a little older
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
but you can see that on that spreadsheet
 
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
right here in this first page here
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
that over the course that year where we
 
00:13:05.569 --> 00:13:05.579 align:start position:0%
were short
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
in terms why I guess on the the next
 
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
page down
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh we were short 2.27 million dollars
 
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
that year in providing the actual cost
 
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
for transportation you see the actual
 
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:18.949 align:start position:0%
for transportation you see the actual
loss

00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
loss
 
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
which are uh
 
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
see that yeah the tuition and
 
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
transportation the actual uh tuition
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
costs were were 10.3 million dollars and
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
and you're looking at tuition there
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
we're providing tuition because it's
 
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
amortized or as spread out amongst the
 
00:13:40.009 --> 00:13:40.019 align:start position:0%
number of students participating and
 
00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
when we have more students there's less
 
00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
money per pupil coming out of that nine
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
million dollar pot and so they receive
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
8.1 million dollars that year they were
 
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
shy 2.2 or 2.3 million dollars so
 
00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
whether you change tuition or you change
 
00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
Transportation you've got to uh really
 
00:13:59.889 --> 00:13:59.899 align:start position:0%
increase that amount from 9 million to
 
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
11.2 million dollars to make this work
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
now in the state if you look at our
 
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula under the indicators of
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
what is an adequate education of those
 
00:14:14.329 --> 00:14:14.339 align:start position:0%
13 indicators four of which are CTE
 
00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:16.430 align:start position:0%
13 indicators four of which are CTE
oriented

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
oriented
 
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
now are we providing an adequate
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
education for these students if we're
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
having a cap because they're not
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
receiving the money that is a question
 
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:26.459 align:start position:0%
and policy is very very concerned about
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
are we funding CTE the way we should be
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
when you compare this state to Delaware
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
which has similar number of students
 
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
where their participation is 50 percent
 
00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
of their high school kids take at least
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
one CTE program in our state at 17
 
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.150 align:start position:0%
one CTE program in our state at 17
percent

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
and these are the students that come out
 
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
of CTE centers where their achievement
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
scores are higher than the achievement
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
scores coming out of rigor High School
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
they're by five percentage points their
 
00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
CTE gives them a skill they come out
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
with a skill their their career ready
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
that's something you don't come out of a
 
00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
high school with they're employable and
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
they have purpose and of that 75 percent
 
00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:08.339 align:start position:0%
of the kids at CTE go on to
 
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:11.220 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education so there's all
 
00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:13.139 align:start position:0%
kinds of reasons why we really need to
 
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
really put our sites into this Career
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
Technical education program
 
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
uh it's a program which has a lot of
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
needs and a lot of issues but it's also
 
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
the one educational component that I see
 
00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
that it's going to really Drive our
 
00:15:29.689 --> 00:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
Workforce Drive our economy and that's
 
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
where we have to have more kids coming
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
out this Knowledge and Skills how to
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
perform these jobs when I was down to
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
Salem uh CTE Center and I was querying
 
00:15:41.329 --> 00:15:41.339 align:start position:0%
from students where what are you doing
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
here you're studying what robotics or no
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
I'm studying medical preparation medical
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
medicine I said where are you going
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
young lady and she was a senior so and
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
this is at the beginning of the senior
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
year in CTE at The Vocational Center
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
down there oh I've already been accepted
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
of Virginia Tech
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
these students are highly qualified
 
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
students we need to have more of our
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
students attending CTE centers that
 
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:08.220 align:start position:0%
means we have to identify what we're
 
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
doing with transportation and just
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
because we have to jump it up maybe two
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars we can't go down but
 
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
what we have to remember what is the
 
00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:19.019 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of these centers what is
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
the purpose what we're here sitting for
 
00:16:23.689 --> 00:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
today so I'll conclude my presentation
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I went on so long with it but
 
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
I'm really involved with CTE it's a real
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
important area which we need to stress
 
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
questions Mary
 
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you cheer
 
00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:39.779 align:start position:0%
lad I um agree with you
 
00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:40.610 align:start position:0%
lad I um agree with you
um

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620 align:start position:0%

um
for

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
as long as I can remember
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
the rate has been the same in as many
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
budgets as I've worked on as I can
 
00:16:50.519 --> 00:16:52.189 align:start position:0%
budgets as I've worked on as I can
remember

00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
remember
 
00:16:52.199 --> 00:16:53.030 align:start position:0%
remember
um

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
I highly recommend that I hope division
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
two will look at this with favor and add
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
to the line to the amount of 11.2
 
00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:08.459 align:start position:0%
million dollars for this purpose we all
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
know and it's it's a national
 
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
recommendation that more students attend
 
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
CTE programs and to encourage them to do
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
this if this is one way we can do it I
 
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
think we should invest in our kids I
 
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
have watched students go through these
 
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
programs I worked at a school of
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
technology and I just have just the
 
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
highest praise and
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
not to do this is just unconscionable we
 
00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:38.810 align:start position:0%
not to do this is just unconscionable we
have

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
I I don't even know how many years it's
 
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
been the same amount you have no it's
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
been there ever since I've been in the
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
house that's dating myself but I do know
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
that the benefit of this we had a young
 
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
man that graduated from the CTE Center
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
here in Concord with Steve Rothenberg
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
went on to White Mountain Community
 
00:17:59.570 --> 00:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
College majoring in diesel mechanics he
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
came back and he was hired right on at
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
Kenworth right here and charged that
 
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
program he walked into a job which is a
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
fantastic opportunity I'm seeing that
 
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
from uh Mr frawworth who who's also a
 
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
director down south of us and with Chris
 
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
Dodge down in Salem and up on the Lakes
 
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
Region these directors are very much in
 
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
tune in working with programs that are
 
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
going to benefit this state we are also
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
using instructors within there that
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
maybe not don't have the teacher
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
certification but they come highly
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
trained for example from a Napa
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
technology program or Toyota and we are
 
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
getting funding support from Toyota from
 
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
GMC from Ford we have certain centers
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
that are they're driving home not
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
driving but they are they're they're
 
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
dealing with auto mechanics and that and
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
they're substitis quite thoroughly by by
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire automobile deal
 
00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
Dealers Association so there's a lot to
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
it there's a lot of business groups
 
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
which are anxious to see this occur I
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
would say if you asked me where is our
 
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
number one or number two priority and
 
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
this is one of them this is it again
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad for taking the
 
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
questions first I want to say that
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
having taught the equivalent of CD
 
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
classes for over a decade for a living
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
you know it was a Microsoft certified
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
trainer and whatnot I highly value those
 
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
that type of training and I think it's a
 
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
very valuable way to you know get use
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
useful job skills to our students I'm
 
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand a little bit
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
more the impact of this particular bill
 
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
I looked at the you know current chapter
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
and the weight is representing and it
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
seems that the major changes that we
 
00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:46.460 align:start position:0%
want to move away from
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursing based on the number of
 
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
students that get transportations and
 
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
just base this on the vehicle would that
 
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
be well the vehicle a number of trips
 
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
correct I mean yeah that's right so
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
basically we removed the counting of how
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
many kids are in a van we just base it
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
on the number of trips with a van and
 
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
the mileage rates yeah and there are
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
several components there within this
 
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
that legislation comes from uh some of
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
their Midwestern states from Colorado
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
and other places yes my concern that I
 
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
would appreciate if you would address is
 
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
that right now because we base the
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
funding formula based on the number of
 
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
children and again we could just tweak
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement rate and you know
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
leave the law in place to achieve more
 
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.130 align:start position:0%
leave the law in place to achieve more
funding

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
my concern is that by removing that you
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
may unintentionally remove an incentive
 
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
for the school districts to be as
 
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
effective as possible in selecting the
 
00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
vehicle that they are using basically
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
you would reimburse the same this
 
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
formula will reimburse the same if we
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
send one school bus with one student
 
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.970 align:start position:0%
send one school bus with one student
inside

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:43.980 align:start position:0%
inside
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
that's why in the bill itself you'll see
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to get away from this
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
formula uh policy wise but it's going to
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
takes time with the department and the
 
00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:56.700 align:start position:0%
CTE director working with getting the
 
00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
information in from these school
 
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:00.140 align:start position:0%
districts regarding
 
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
Transportation costing and and the
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for a van would be based
 
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:09.620 align:start position:0%
upon the miles that's gotten in the van
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
CBD number trips miles taken type of
 
00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
vehicle rather than
 
00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
as you if you as you've identified on
 
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
the per pupil basis which uh it does
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
make a whole lot of sense when we're
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
talking about trying to uh increase the
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
number of kids which are attending uh
 
00:21:33.649 --> 00:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
the CTE centers and in many districts
 
00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
are having to contract that service with
 
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
the bus transportation company whether
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's first student or Durham or some
 
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
other outfit and they're running huge
 
00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:45.419 align:start position:0%
buses and that's what the contract is
 
00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:48.059 align:start position:0%
charging us I think we can reduce and
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
save money by moving to a new formula to
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
support more kid kids going to the
 
00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
centers I I just one last follow-up very
 
00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.529 align:start position:0%
centers I I just one last follow-up very
quickly

00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:00.539 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
to me when I look at the current bill
 
00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
you know your policy goal is to
 
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
incentivize you know more kids going
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
there to me it seems that by paying
 
00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:12.539 align:start position:0%
based on the number of students you are
 
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
giving the schools an incentive to
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
increase the number of kids in the
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
school bus while just basing it on the
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
trip would make it neutral to the school
 
00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
you know you get the same reimbursement
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's one kid or more I'm just
 
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
trying to understand your thoughts on
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
this potential issue it's it's due to
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have in that nine
 
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
million dollars that same nine million
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
dollars is used for both transportation
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
and tuition it's locked together
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
so if you increase your transportation
 
00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:42.539 align:start position:0%
costs you're decreasing the amount of
 
00:22:45.169 --> 00:22:45.179 align:start position:0%
money available for tuition and so
 
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
therefore you're eliminating kids from
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
participating in the program
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh and and and by doing that
 
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
um we are locked that that formula is
 
00:22:58.850 --> 00:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
locking Us in this this process so one
 
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
way around that is to one change the
 
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
reimbursement formula for transportation
 
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
but also to include that money into that
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
nine million dollars so that when for
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
example we now are counting kids which
 
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
are transported from Exeter from
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
Nashville and from Manchester that is
 
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of money it's
 
00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
available for tuition and so then the
 
00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:21.539 align:start position:0%
school district of May at one time
 
00:23:24.049 --> 00:23:24.059 align:start position:0%
received X number of dollars is now
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
they're receiving x minus you know the
 
00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
the the result of the three districts
 
00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
which are now involved we're also uh
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
involving kids now in grades 10 11 and
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
12 and so that's an expansion of the
 
00:23:39.409 --> 00:23:39.419 align:start position:0%
program so we're our numbers we're
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
trying to increase but what's
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
restricting us is the financial support
 
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
being given to this program it does
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
restrict and it turns out to end up
 
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
being a 91a issue with the local school
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
districts it's unfunded mandate simply
 
00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
because every student deserves the
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to attend and when you say
 
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
as a district well we can't send anymore
 
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
because we don't have any more money are
 
00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
you then having to flip a coin as to who
 
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
goes or who doesn't go that is not in
 
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
accordance with an adequate education
 
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome Ken
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you chairman
 
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
Ladd your testimony appears to say we
 
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
need 2.2 million in this budget we're
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
working on now but the effective date on
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is July 1st 2025 so is it two
 
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
different things here one is give me 2.2
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
million in the budget you're working on
 
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
and change the formula for the next by
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
any means you you're reading it
 
00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr directly
 
00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:45.059 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for taking my question
 
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
you worked very hard at education
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
problems here my question is um have you
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
ever seen any studies as to how many
 
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
kids and CTE go on to post-secondary
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
education yep yep we have 75 percent of
 
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
those so it takes 75 percent of your 10
 
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
000 kids those are the kids going in the
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education many of them
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
choose the community college system
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
where they're refining those skills but
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
because of the degree of technical
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
difficulty presented at CTE centers now
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
some are opting to go right to the
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
Virginia tax of the world and and clean
 
00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:24.539 align:start position:0%
it up there so this is a program that I
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
highly recommend it's and I highly you
 
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
know uh
 
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
encourage you to visit one of our CTE
 
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
centers you're going to see things that
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
you once only saw at the University
 
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.909 align:start position:0%
you once only saw at the University
level

00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chair and thanks to
 
00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419 align:start position:0%
chair Weiler for asking three of my
 
00:25:42.419 --> 00:25:43.730 align:start position:0%
chair Weiler for asking three of my
questions

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:43.740 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:25:45.409 --> 00:25:45.419 align:start position:0%
the one question that I have remaining
 
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
is that what group is looking at the
 
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
formula and when that formula is revised
 
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
does that need legislation will that be
 
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
coming back as legislation or are you
 
00:25:57.769 --> 00:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.930 --> 00:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
I I think where where you are and now
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
you're we made the policy decision down
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
in policy recognizing and having that
 
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
impact it's now up to you right here to
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
identify to look at the funding issue
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
which we have a severe funding issue
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
here but also then to move Statute in
 
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
accordance to support that uh so I think
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
that can be done through your hb2
 
00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.289 align:start position:0%
that can be done through your hb2
legislation

00:26:27.289 --> 00:26:27.299 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
um and the money in the HP one uh
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
there's where it needs to happen and uh
 
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
I hope you do it
 
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
oh if we get this in hb2 can the policy
 
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
can this be effective before 2025 does
 
00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
that make sense I mean we're putting in
 
00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
this money now to cover the the
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
difference between the 9 and 11. these
 
00:26:48.289 --> 00:26:48.299 align:start position:0%
are the two components that
 
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
representative Myler was just
 
00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
referencing there's really two issues on
 
00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:55.799 align:start position:0%
the table right now one that 2.2 million
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
and this was identified when uh a number
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
of us have been on the advisory Council
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
in fact that's where uh representative
 
00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:06.539 align:start position:0%
umberger was last year and we all
 
00:27:09.049 --> 00:27:09.059 align:start position:0%
recognized we had to get that 2.2
 
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
million dollars just to sustain what
 
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
we're doing right now properly and to
 
00:27:15.769 --> 00:27:15.779 align:start position:0%
get more students involved the second
 
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
part of this is dealing with the tuition
 
00:27:21.649 --> 00:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
Transportation formula and that can't be
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
initiated for several years seeing that
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
we as representative Weiler noted there
 
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
it's going to take some work we just
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to open up something and then
 
00:27:33.649 --> 00:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
be going down some kind of a rabbit hole
 
00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:36.299 align:start position:0%
and not having things done properly we
 
00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
want to make sure this is done
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely correctly we do know that
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
many states are really doing this well
 
00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
as a result of changing the formula from
 
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
a per pupil type formula which we've had
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
for over a decade to what is something
 
00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:54.299 align:start position:0%
that's more reasonable and and really
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
goes in the path of getting more
 
00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:00.179 --> 00:28:02.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair would you accept a motion
 
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
um to approve
 
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
chair Lads request for 2.2 million in
 
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
each year of the biennium for TNT and
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
for hb2 to um adopt the formula change
 
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:27.779 align:start position:0%
would you accept that what about this
 
00:28:27.779 --> 00:28:28.730 align:start position:0%
would you accept that what about this
bill

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:33.769 align:start position:0%
bill
okay

00:28:33.769 --> 00:28:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
all right we have a second
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
motion made and second here are you
 
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:48.890 align:start position:0%
motion made and second here are you
ready

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's making me do this by a show of
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
hands all those in favor
 
00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:01.610 align:start position:0%
 
don't

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.649 --> 00:29:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
okay moving on to 5 40. thank you thank
 
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
you Rick you're welcome Ken
 
00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:18.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
I will say you're an excellent advocate
 
00:29:20.039 --> 00:29:20.870 align:start position:0%
I will say you're an excellent advocate
for

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
hey I I tell you if I had children in my
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
household right now I'd aim them in that
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
direction there's no question when I saw
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
that young man now working at Kenworth
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
earning over 80 000 a year
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
starting right
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
and enjoying what he's doing
 
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:59.810 --> 00:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:03.419 align:start position:0%
okay well open the hearing on House Bill
 
00:30:03.419 --> 00:30:06.470 align:start position:0%
okay well open the hearing on House Bill
540.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much uh
 
00:30:09.529 --> 00:30:09.539 align:start position:0%
representative Emrick and members of the
 
00:30:13.149 --> 00:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
uh at division two uh finance committee
 
00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:16.740 align:start position:0%
this one's not quite as easy
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
um uh but it's uh
 
00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
it's again another bill that came out of
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh education policy unanimously
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the formula here and
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with the adequacy
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
formula and you know that there's that
 
00:30:33.169 --> 00:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
component within differentiated Aid
 
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
which deals with special education
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
we have had uh much testimony
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
that and I in fact had a meeting last
 
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
night that started at approximately 5 30
 
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
drove home stopped at the Warren Village
 
00:30:51.409 --> 00:30:51.419 align:start position:0%
door at store school and
 
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
um ended up speaking with the principal
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
of that school for until 7 7 15 at night
 
00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
and it was all over
 
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
this portion of adequacy special
 
00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
education costs
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
now we have 39 States within the country
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
right now that are looking at that
 
00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
identify a process or funding
 
00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:15.380 align:start position:0%
differentiated AIDS special education
 
00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
using a weighted formula we have one
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
formula which we use for differentiated
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
Aid regardless and there's a sheet which
 
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
you have there you might look at first
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
that says special education 13
 
00:31:30.649 --> 00:31:30.659 align:start position:0%
disability categories on the bottom of
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
those are the 13 areas according to
 
00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:39.179 align:start position:0%
federal law and New Hampshire Rule and
 
00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law which we identify
 
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
students who may have a special
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
education disability
 
00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
and you can see from the top you go from
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
developmental delay to specific learning
 
00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
disabilities like in the area of a a
 
00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
reading or language arts or mathematics
 
00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
where you see such a discrepancy between
 
00:31:59.930 --> 00:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
certain areas in learning I won't get
 
00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:02.820 align:start position:0%
into that to keep my principal ship back
 
00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
behind me here and did you see some
 
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
other areas like orthopedically
 
00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
handicapped or tranic brain injury
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
um some severe type handicapping
 
00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:15.049 align:start position:0%
um some severe type handicapping
conditions

00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:15.059 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
when we're providing in our formula and
 
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
differentiate Aid approximately two
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for each student that
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
has an IEP
 
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
we know that there's some IEPs for
 
00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
example a few of a student receiving
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
Speech Pathology or speech therapy and
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
the issue is they have that R problem
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
you know they're from New England it's
 
00:32:39.769 --> 00:32:39.779 align:start position:0%
an articulation issue and so
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
um or they have other articulation
 
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
issues just not the r because the r is
 
00:32:45.409 --> 00:32:45.419 align:start position:0%
part of what we are
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
um the issue is that student may have
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
only a need to meet with a speech
 
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
pathologist or somebody delivering that
 
00:32:57.529 --> 00:32:57.539 align:start position:0%
service for a half hour twice a week
 
00:33:00.169 --> 00:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
however we have other students that are
 
00:33:03.769 --> 00:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
needing toilting they may be a mute they
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
may have disability from traumatic brain
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
injury they may have you know an
 
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
intellectual disability where they need
 
00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:13.559 align:start position:0%
constant work
 
00:33:15.769 --> 00:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
the need not just accommodation they
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
need modification a program those are
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
terms within special education law
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
so what we're looking at in this bill
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
here is having three category areas and
 
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
you can also see I provided you a sheet
 
00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:31.559 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately had somebody scribble
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
on it but this is a sheet which is
 
00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:37.940 align:start position:0%
required underneath the uh
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
idea Part B where we notify the Feds
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
that we have students that require more
 
00:33:49.009 --> 00:33:49.019 align:start position:0%
than 80 percent of a day to have special
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
education services
 
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
we know that those students which are
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
below 80 percent that require less time
 
00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
than the 80 or more and we also know
 
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
that we have students that are placed in
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
hospital situations or residential
 
00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
placements uh which can be very costly
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
that we we support that through our
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid or what we call special
 
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
education Aid now where you you're
 
00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:15.899 align:start position:0%
familiar with the formula where it's
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
three and a half times you have to pay
 
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
for us if you're not under the special
 
00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:22.379 align:start position:0%
education Aid the responsibility for you
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
as a school district to pay for the
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
special education costs are for the
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
three first three and a half times the
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
average per pupil cost and if the
 
00:34:33.169 --> 00:34:33.179 align:start position:0%
average cost per year is twenty thousand
 
00:34:34.609 --> 00:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
dollars you're gonna have to Fork out
 
00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
twenty seventy thousand dollars before
 
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
you're going to get any support from the
 
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
state other than what's in
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
differentiated that two thousand dollars
 
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:46.740 align:start position:0%
once you get beyond the three and a half
 
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
mark up to ten times that average cost
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
per pupil the state sets in and pays 80
 
00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:54.419 align:start position:0%
percent of that
 
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
so this District's still on the hook for
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
the twenty percent twenty twenty percent
 
00:35:01.849 --> 00:35:01.859 align:start position:0%
of that once you get back Beyond ten
 
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
times the state pays that different that
 
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
the rest of it
 
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
those costs are extremely extremely
 
00:35:11.329 --> 00:35:11.339 align:start position:0%
costly I've had one District I sat in
 
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
with a speaker of the house this last
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
summer where the school board was up in
 
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
the office there across the street
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
saying we're short 1.5 million dollars
 
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
in special education and we've looked
 
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
everywhere and we're having now taken
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
out of the operational side of the
 
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
budget in other areas and that's
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
subtracting from another area
 
00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.810 align:start position:0%
subtracting from another area
programming

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
programming
 
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
so what we have here is a need to
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
recognize in our Even in our base
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula that there are
 
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
differences between these IEPs in terms
 
00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:43.079 align:start position:0%
of what is needed last year when you
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
passed the extraordinary needs Grant
 
00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:49.619 align:start position:0%
um we tacked on and and education policy
 
00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
another 14 million dollars based upon a
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
formula which had these weighted
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
components for special educate education
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
Aid we did it not the way we're doing
 
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
here we did it by saying well we think
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
that the first three categories cost
 
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
this much the next three that but
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of overage between these
 
00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
categories it's a wrong way of doing it
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
we determine that the best way to time
 
00:36:14.089 --> 00:36:14.099 align:start position:0%
needed from staff and services during
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
the course of a day
 
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
so if they're over 80 percent they're
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
big time needs there in terms of Finance
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
to support that disability and that
 
00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.530 align:start position:0%
to support that disability and that
child

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
so what this does it UPS the ante as far
 
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
as you can see on this sheet right here
 
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
and this right here there's two sheets
 
00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:34.700 align:start position:0%
which you may have here
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
the first one is what we did last year
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
and we were told that of our special
 
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
education students there's 30 309 kids
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
in this state with IEPs out of our 164
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
okay there's thirty thousand plus
 
00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
students that have IEPs in this state
 
00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
we have a total of course around what
 
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
164 000 give or take students in the
 
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
state so there's uh increasing number of
 
00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
students that number has been at that
 
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.130 align:start position:0%
students that number has been at that
level

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
for our last 10 years but our
 
00:37:11.089 --> 00:37:11.099 align:start position:0%
demographic mistake
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
has gone the opposite direction from uh
 
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
two hundred and ten thousand students in
 
00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years to now the 160 Plus
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
however our student education population
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
in special education has not decreased
 
00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:29.339 align:start position:0%
in numbers in fact stayed somewhat
 
00:37:29.339 --> 00:37:30.349 align:start position:0%
in numbers in fact stayed somewhat
stable

00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
stable
 
00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
and at that but it says there's a higher
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
incidence of special education amongst
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
our students than there was back 10
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:42.839 align:start position:0%
so we're looking now at trying to figure
 
00:37:46.609 --> 00:37:46.619 align:start position:0%
out how to fund that and the first sheet
 
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
shows you know the percentages we had in
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
numbers that we were given last year by
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
the department we had of those that are
 
00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
in category a that be the category of
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
less than 80 percent of the time there
 
00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
were 26 825 three students in the next
 
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
category those which were more than
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
eight eighty percent time it was seven
 
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
or two thousand seven hundred and twenty
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
eight students and those that are in
 
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
residential placements or Hospital
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
placements or other placements as
 
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
described on this sheet right here from
 
00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
the Feds that you have
 
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
um were uh more uh more much more costly
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
that it was 2.5 percent of our student
 
00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
population we have since been told by
 
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
Finance people at uh at the department
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
that these figures are more accurate
 
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
so so they look to me to be more
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
approximations as well but they're all
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
parking and I guess uh we're looking at
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
of the thirty thousand six hundred
 
00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:46.140 align:start position:0%
students twenty three thousand the
 
00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
category a b seven thousand students and
 
00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
C 600 students so 600 are the most needy
 
00:38:53.569 --> 00:38:53.579 align:start position:0%
students that are going to places like
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
Beckett Beckett uh school or being
 
00:38:59.870 --> 00:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
placed out of state even still so lastly
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
the additional cost to support this
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
program would be 21 million dollars
 
00:39:07.609 --> 00:39:07.619 align:start position:0%
doing it the way we did last year it
 
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
cost around 14 million dollars but that
 
00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
is a figure that you're you two you
 
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
would have to look at uh however if you
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
look at the study Commission
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
which we had
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
a year and a half ago uh that commission
 
00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
look at the weighted formula and I did
 
00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:26.339 align:start position:0%
agree with the weighted portions I
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
didn't agree necessarily with what kind
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
of a value they were giving to
 
00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
weightedness it was 4.19 of the base
 
00:39:37.849 --> 00:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
adequacy figure our base attic squeeze
 
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
four thousand dollars so you go four
 
00:39:41.569 --> 00:39:41.579 align:start position:0%
times four you're seeing you're already
 
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
up to sixteen thousand dollars right
 
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
there uh for what would have been
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
differentiated eight if you look at this
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
formula right here and we're looking at
 
00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:53.579 align:start position:0%
a costing uh two thousand dollars which
 
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
that is our present formula for
 
00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
differentiated a that's what you'll be
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
looking at for FY 23.
 
00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
category B is 4729 so that's a little
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
bit more than what base adequacy is so
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
we're at a factor of one point something
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
and if you look at category C what
 
00:40:13.609 --> 00:40:13.619 align:start position:0%
that's the residential placements within
 
00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid you're looking at
 
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
approximately a 1.5
 
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
so a base adequacy so and compared to
 
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
those other 39 States in this country
 
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
this is very low of what we're doing to
 
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
support special education this is why
 
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
you're seeing so many towns saying now
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
like a Paramount that's just south of me
 
00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
the budget they're looking at this year
 
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
is 22 percent higher than it was last
 
00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
year simply because of what they're
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
receiving special education and they're
 
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:47.220 align:start position:0%
of course inflationary costs and
 
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
operational costs are also going up
 
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of rationale for it but
 
00:40:52.609 --> 00:40:52.619 align:start position:0%
then as I drove through Warren this
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
morning I saw a sign out front come to
 
00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
our meeting on Thursday night we are
 
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
looking at the discrepancies between
 
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
what we're asked to do what we're told
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
we have to do and what we're able to
 
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
raise locally through our property taxes
 
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
so this federal government when they put
 
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
special education in place said we are
 
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
going to fund you at 40 percent level
 
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
we're down West around 16 right now at
 
00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:19.430 align:start position:0%
we're down West around 16 right now at
best

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
best
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
and what we've created is a 91a issue no
 
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
in it's happening and so what are we
 
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
going to do to try to show that through
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
our adequacy formula we are working to
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
try to help share that burden we're
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
going to contribute to it so that's why
 
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:37.740 align:start position:0%
you see this bill coming forward we are
 
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:40.140 align:start position:0%
recommending from policy that a weighted
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
version of supporting special education
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
be applied to the differentiated
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
component of of adequacy formula thank
 
00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:51.050 align:start position:0%
component of of adequacy formula thank
you

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you again
 
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
for taking the questions I'm trying to
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
understand why category B swings so much
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
if you look at the handout on you know
 
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
the top of the first page the number of
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
special education pupils in category B
 
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
on the left side is 2728 on the right
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
side is about seven thousand that when
 
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
originally viewing that I thought it was
 
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
a change in the formula you said it's
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
just a different estimate I would
 
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
appreciate an explanation that's what we
 
00:42:20.569 --> 00:42:20.579 align:start position:0%
got from the Department evidently
 
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
they're saying that they have more kids
 
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
that you see the numbers come out of a
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
category a where it goes from 26 to 23.
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
so it's that I would say these figures
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
um I would look at the spreadsheets
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to get from them in terms
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
of special education differentiated Aid
 
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
you'll see the number of students
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
they're planning for then I would ask
 
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
the question of them how does that break
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
down in terms of this formula right here
 
00:42:52.609 --> 00:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
that you're responsible for
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
that federal law idea because that
 
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
breakdown has to be figured out how many
 
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
students are in a how many RMB how many
 
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
are in C these are the figures I've been
 
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
able to get to this point we're working
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
on figures which we got I got from the
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
director uh about half three quarters of
 
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
a year ago and then when we were
 
00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:17.339 align:start position:0%
dealing with this bill in the hearings
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
this year it was a notified to us that
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
the figures have changed and we have
 
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
these approximations for you so I would
 
00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
say you need to do a little bit of
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
research yourselves on this to make sure
 
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
you're getting accurate figures the
 
00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:32.099 align:start position:0%
whole concept though and the principle
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
behind this is we need to have a
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
weighted formula that's more supportive
 
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
of what we're doing out in the field
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't worry we just started with the
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
questions on this one but I appreciate
 
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
your information obviously we'll follow
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
up in a lot of detail because that's
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
still a humongous jump in a number that
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
as you were saying for 10 years has been
 
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
more or less flat at the total when
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
suddenly I'm told the category more than
 
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
doubles but I think we need to look into
 
00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:03.020 align:start position:0%
it right if you look at Aid
 
00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:05.339 align:start position:0%
re-categorizing it's not the number of
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
students it's just how they're sliding
 
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
between percent yeah
 
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
take care
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
so when I saw this number 2079 and I
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
thought where have I read that before
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
and so I'm looking in hb2
 
00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.370 align:start position:0%
and so I'm looking in hb2
and

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
find it on I think now I split the pages
 
00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:32.270 align:start position:0%
find it on I think now I split the pages
65.

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
65.
 
00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
where nope that's not it
 
00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:40.700 align:start position:0%
but it's it's one the governor assigned
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
in in hb2 the 2079 was already an
 
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
increase he put in I don't know whether
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
you gave it to him or he figured it out
 
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.170 align:start position:0%
you gave it to him or he figured it out
but

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.130 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
he put that in there so that 55 million
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
times 2079 is already in hb2 that that
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
is correct 2000 the the amount of money
 
00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:05.660 align:start position:0%
that you should have seen for
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
2079 bucks and so much sense that that
 
00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:11.339 align:start position:0%
is the figure which you've had for
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
differentiated just based upon the
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
adjustments that we give that formula
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
based on CPI uh so okay from year to
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
from every two years so then when we go
 
00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
we go to category B and C which he did
 
00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
not include we would have to subtract
 
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
the four thousand the 2079 from the 4729
 
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.450 align:start position:0%
the four thousand the 2079 from the 4729
times

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:34.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.089 --> 00:45:38.099 align:start position:0%
2728 pupils and the category C you'd
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
subtract the 2079
 
00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
from the six thousand two thirty nine
 
00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.329 align:start position:0%
from the six thousand two thirty nine
times

00:45:44.329 --> 00:45:44.339 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh 758 pupil to figure out
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
the extra cost that we're talking about
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
that's correct representative but a lot
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
of it is already in hb2 that's my point
 
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
as part of adequacy it's it's there uh
 
00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
we're just looking at a policy change in
 
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
terms of how we do support that category
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
uh the policy committee believes
 
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
strongly that there's such a difference
 
00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
between these 13 IEP categories that you
 
00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
see here and the amount of time and the
 
00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars required to deliver
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
that service some of that can provide
 
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
right by the resource room teacher uh
 
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
you know when you're talking about
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
specific learning disability but there's
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
others which are really challenging in
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
terms of costs and the differentiated
 
00:46:30.359 --> 00:46:31.490 align:start position:0%
terms of costs and the differentiated
Aid

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
Aid
 
00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
does not support that the way we really
 
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:38.329 align:start position:0%
does not support that the way we really
should

00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:38.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you chairman
 
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
LED um just a question
 
00:46:42.359 --> 00:46:43.010 align:start position:0%
LED um just a question
um

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
who will make the determination will be
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
at the local at the Lea level and will
 
00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
the Lea report out costs per child for
 
00:46:56.089 --> 00:46:56.099 align:start position:0%
special education and then the
 
00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:58.140 align:start position:0%
determination of the category will be
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
made that way
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
um how would we do this
 
00:47:05.569 --> 00:47:05.579 align:start position:0%
the course the IEPs put together at the
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
local level right and you have your
 
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
Specialists and your Administration
 
00:47:11.089 --> 00:47:11.099 align:start position:0%
participating in that along with the
 
00:47:11.099 --> 00:47:11.990 align:start position:0%
participating in that along with the
parent

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
and the decisions made that Susan needs
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
an IEP and you identify the services
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
which are going to be provided
 
00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
some people have asked me
 
00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:24.839 align:start position:0%
represent Ladd are they going to really
 
00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
try to stack the deck and and put more
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
people in this category than that
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
category I think that that would be a
 
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
dreadful error
 
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
um and especially when the area of
 
00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
special education is one that's
 
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
seriously looked at and litigated also
 
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
within the iepss you identify the number
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
of services provided to this student in
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
that categorical area each day or each
 
00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
week and it's sometimes to say it's uh
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a Speech Pathology
 
00:47:59.089 --> 00:47:59.099 align:start position:0%
twice a week well that obviously is one
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's eighty percent or less so the IEP
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
will identify that when the IEPs are
 
00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
then direct as sent to the at that
 
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
information is sent to the Department of
 
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
Education by the directors down in the
 
00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
school districts then it is Consolidated
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
and that's where we come up with the
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
aggregate information
 
00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
oh the follow-up would be with regard to
 
00:48:23.329 --> 00:48:23.339 align:start position:0%
our Charter Schools
 
00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
um because the Lea continues to be
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for the cost of special
 
00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.490 align:start position:0%
responsible for the cost of special
education

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
um so sometimes there are extraordinary
 
00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
costs just for transportation and just
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
because of the nature that they're in
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
different locations and needs a
 
00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.809 align:start position:0%
different locations and needs a
different

00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:48:40.849 --> 00:48:40.859 align:start position:0%
um how will that be played out
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
well that cost is now reflected in the
 
00:48:47.089 --> 00:48:47.099 align:start position:0%
the budget that that uh the school
 
00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
that's providing the services receives
 
00:48:53.089 --> 00:48:53.099 align:start position:0%
those dollars right now the uh the
 
00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
charter school does not receive that
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
money that's one area within
 
00:48:58.970 --> 00:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid it goes to the
 
00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
they're providing Public School
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
but that again my understanding would be
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
then that all factors would be for a
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
child within a charter who has a
 
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
disability in an IEP all those factors
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
would be identified all costs would be
 
00:49:19.609 --> 00:49:19.619 align:start position:0%
identified in the IEP for that child
 
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct and the determination
 
00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
would be made at that point in time
 
00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
when that IAP is signed that's when it's
 
00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:29.220 align:start position:0%
made those determinations by the parent
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
so this particular bill is as much a
 
00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:40.609 align:start position:0%
so this particular bill is as much a
policy

00:49:40.609 --> 00:49:40.619 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
change that as it is dollars I would say
 
00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:48.380 align:start position:0%
it's both uh you're you're impacting
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
you're you're looking at your adequacy
 
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
formula but you're also looking the
 
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
policy in which generates these those
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
changes in your your formula
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
so it's a combination of both but
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
but it's set all it said in the
 
00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:06.349 align:start position:0%
but it's set all it said in the
parameters

00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
parameters
 
00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
I mean the ABC yeah you're just kind of
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
defining here what here's what yes we're
 
00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
establishing the weighted categories for
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
them receiving the amount that's
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate and differentiated eight
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
okay question yeah I just wanted to
 
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
follow up on what you are saying so the
 
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
policy part of this obviously is
 
00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
determining that instead of just one
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
blanket level we want to have three
 
00:50:34.609 --> 00:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
differentiated level and describing the
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
ways that kids are put into ABC right
 
00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:38.339 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
the finance part is obviously figuring
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
out how much money we can uh you know
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
put in there because that's gonna be a
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
decision that will take more work than
 
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
we can do this morning so I think you
 
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
know I would suggest but not make the
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
motion yet but I would suggest that I'm
 
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
leaning towards retaining this so that
 
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
we can continue working on it once
 
00:50:59.210 --> 00:50:59.220 align:start position:0%
everybody is ready for a motion
 
00:51:02.329 --> 00:51:02.339 align:start position:0%
Mary I would make that motion to retain
 
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
house bill 540.
 
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
great second
 
00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
motion made in second account
 
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
I don't know if Mickey was doing the
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
same figures I'm doing
 
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
I'm using 2079 which is in
 
00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:16.849 align:start position:0%
I'm using 2079 which is in
hb2

00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
times all these students then I go to
 
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
the two categories and add the
 
00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
differences and I come up with an extra
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
10 million
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
10 million three
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
it's not about what you came up so
 
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
compared to so working off of the
 
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:32.099 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget at this
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
point adequacy this bill is about 12
 
00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year above the funding
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
level in here all right I came up with
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
10. we came up with 10-2 when we were
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
playing with these figures last year
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
with representative Hennessey
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
which you know that's
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
we'll find it
 
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
anyway I just was running the figures
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
what I'm doing is subtracting 20079 from
 
00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.430 align:start position:0%
what I'm doing is subtracting 20079 from
the

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
4729 and also from the six thousand two
 
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
thirty nine times the number of students
 
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
you came up with 12
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
yeah there's some I mean we can get into
 
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
this later when we talk about it but
 
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
anyway I don't have spreadsheets with me
 
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm seeing as as the class
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
to to meet these criteria anyway just
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
thought I'd point that out while we're
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
busy here doing numbers thank you Mr
 
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
chair uh question do we need to retain
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
this or can we add this into hb2 once we
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
figured out the the additional amount
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
that we need as we just did with the
 
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
if um we are all agreeable
 
00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:42.020 align:start position:0%
um I believe that we are agreeable
 
00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:45.140 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense to you
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
the motion of course right now is truly
 
00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:48.650 align:start position:0%
the motion of course right now is truly
tank

00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
tank
 
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
um and I would withdraw my motion okay
 
00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
and my new motion no Nikki's telling me
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
I just want to remind everyone where we
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
are with the process we have to do a
 
00:52:58.849 --> 00:52:58.859 align:start position:0%
recommendation on these bills so we have
 
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
to Circle back probably to 364. and
 
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
actually make a retain motion which we
 
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
didn't a motion of uh
 
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
just adding it to the budget where I
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
think we'll retain and then as we do our
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
budget work similarly to our 10 prior
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
bills when we get into a budget work
 
00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:16.140 align:start position:0%
session we'll work on House Bill one and
 
00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:18.660 align:start position:0%
two changes so I think what I'm hearing
 
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mickey all in favor
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
of retaining
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay unanimous
 
00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh next up and Mr chair you may just
 
00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:38.460 align:start position:0%
want to confirm that with 364 the first
 
00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:41.220 align:start position:0%
bill we had today it you are retaining
 
00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:44.579 align:start position:0%
that bill uh I believe the plan is to
 
00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
include the language although it it
 
00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't take effect until fiscal 26
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
which is beyond this upcoming biennial
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
budget and that section doesn't have a
 
00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
direct Financial impact so it's up to
 
00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
you and the committee if you want to
 
00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
pass that bill
 
00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
on its own and then make the increase in
 
00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
the line item for tuition and
 
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
transportation the 2.2 million we passed
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
okay I I thought the plan was to
 
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
incorporate the bill in the house but we
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
said agb2 so right now the motion is to
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
adopt including hb2 I think what Meek is
 
00:54:16.849 --> 00:54:16.859 align:start position:0%
saying is that we either pass it
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
independently and send it back to the
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
floor or we retain it to include it in
 
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
hb2 I don't is it what you're saying
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
that you cannot really adopt but they
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
say HB to either retain an hb2 or adopt
 
00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
and send to the floor yes you just want
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
to be clear with what are you doing with
 
00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
House Bill 364 are you passing this back
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
are you going to retain it and just keep
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
it in this committee and put the
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
language in-house Bill too I think I
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
which I mean either way I mean whatever
 
00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
the committee play right so I think
 
00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:55.370 align:start position:0%
the committee play right so I think
right

00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:55.380 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
yeah the the 2.2 million we're talking
 
00:54:59.089 --> 00:54:59.099 align:start position:0%
about for tuition and transportation
 
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
that'll be a house bill one amendment in
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
the line item for that so that would be
 
00:55:05.089 --> 00:55:05.099 align:start position:0%
taken care of for 24 and 25 when we do
 
00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
budget work but this bill would be
 
00:55:08.809 --> 00:55:08.819 align:start position:0%
separate of that and that wouldn't this
 
00:55:10.849 --> 00:55:10.859 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take effect until fiscal 26 so
 
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
you could pass this policy separate and
 
00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
keep it out of house bill too as an
 
00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:16.750 align:start position:0%
keep it out of house bill too as an
option

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
I think actually the original motion
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
said adopt but we also said hb2 so if we
 
00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
would be well willing to clarify that
 
00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
well no we adopted the bill right but we
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
agreed that we're going to put the money
 
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
in hb2 right the money HP one so so you
 
00:55:35.569 --> 00:55:35.579 align:start position:0%
may just want to clarify your motion on
 
00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
this is OTP on 365. yeah and then that
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
way it'll go back to the full committee
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
with that recommendation and pass over
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
to the Senate you know on 364 the first
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
bill correct so you were the motion I
 
00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
will make my motion to OTP okay
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
it was made in we it was unanimous both
 
00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
right so but we all agree that this is
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
an OTP and we'll talk about the numbers
 
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
but the language is just OTP got it okay
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
moving right along
 
00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.809 --> 00:56:29.819 align:start position:0%
so this bill I I handed everyone a
 
00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
revised fiscal note
 
00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
that uh based on the amendment the
 
00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
department is saying there is no
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
estimated cost associated with this bill
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
any longer now this is the bill that's
 
00:56:44.329 --> 00:56:44.339 align:start position:0%
relative to the department providing uh
 
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
the House and Senate standing committees
 
00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
on education with laws and rules and a
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
format that uh that's comply that would
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
comply with this bill and they're saying
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
they can do it with no cost
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
can we ask the department to come
 
00:57:01.609 --> 00:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
um if anybody has any questions Diane
 
00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
oh it was it was on
 
00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
I always mess that up
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record my name is
 
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
Diana Fenton I'm an attorney with the
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:57:32.089 --> 00:57:32.099 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions this
 
00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes
 
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
may I ask questions absolutely thank you
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
question isn't this a usual and
 
00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:53.220 align:start position:0%
customary practice that the department
 
00:57:56.089 --> 00:57:56.099 align:start position:0%
of Ed has always done this it it is
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question you're
 
00:57:59.450 --> 00:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
absolutely right uh certainly you know
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
the department better than I do
 
00:58:04.849 --> 00:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
um we have we have in the past
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
um provided that I think that was
 
00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
um done with minor Shannon is it was
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
done with discretionary funds and then
 
00:58:15.049 --> 00:58:15.059 align:start position:0%
when um under commercial edelblute he
 
00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:17.660 align:start position:0%
removed those discretionary funds and so
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
we have not been providing that we have
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
been providing um the information on a
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
flash drive it's on our website there
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
are other ways to access it
 
00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:29.579 align:start position:0%
that being said however everyone who
 
00:58:32.329 --> 00:58:32.339 align:start position:0%
knows me knows that I love the books I
 
00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:34.140 align:start position:0%
love the paper copies I carry one around
 
00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
with me in my car so uh every time this
 
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
issue comes up I can certainly
 
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
understand the legislature's desire to
 
00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
have it in in paper copy
 
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
I would agree I'm we all have little
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
stickies aren't our law books
 
00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:52.140 align:start position:0%
um I personally could never have lived
 
00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
without my law book I continue to like
 
00:58:57.530 --> 00:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
to have a book in my hand and I know the
 
00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
education committee really likes that as
 
00:59:00.119 --> 00:59:00.950 align:start position:0%
education committee really likes that as
well

00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
so this Bill is saying that um
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
this would require the Department of
 
00:59:10.609 --> 00:59:10.619 align:start position:0%
Education to do this yeah um but does
 
00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
does it specify that it is in hard copy
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
not technology wise
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
I I don't I have the amended fiscal note
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
in front of me
 
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
um I do now I have the pillow in front
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
of me he is so good
 
00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:30.490 align:start position:0%
of me he is so good
um

00:59:30.490 --> 00:59:30.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
storage device
 
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
It also says a physical copy of okay a
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
copy on a portable data storage device
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.289 align:start position:0%
 
or

00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:45.299 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
that's a series with an Orient right so
 
00:59:50.329 --> 00:59:50.339 align:start position:0%
it's either of the three should meet the
 
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
legal requirement
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
So based on your input and I don't want
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
to put it on you because I'll add myself
 
00:59:59.049 --> 00:59:59.059 align:start position:0%
to the list
 
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
that we would like that maybe we need a
 
01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.609 align:start position:0%
that we would like that maybe we need a
shell

01:00:04.609 --> 01:00:04.619 align:start position:0%
shell
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
um that the department shall provide
 
01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:10.140 align:start position:0%
a hard copy
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
and for those who wish to have the thumb
 
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
drive they can obtain that but for
 
01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and the
 
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:20.220 align:start position:0%
department members who use it for their
 
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
work purposes that a hard copy be
 
01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.930 align:start position:0%
work purposes that a hard copy be
provided

01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
provided
 
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
I think that was and I'm not here to
 
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
speak for representative Tanner
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
obviously but um my understanding
 
01:00:33.289 --> 01:00:33.299 align:start position:0%
because this bill has been brought
 
01:00:33.299 --> 01:00:34.510 align:start position:0%
because this bill has been brought
forward

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
yes oh yay I was going to say
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner would you like to
 
01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
sit in on your bill
 
01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.630 align:start position:0%
sit in on your bill
good

01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.849 --> 01:00:46.859 align:start position:0%
Tanner is here I don't think on her
 
01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:48.900 align:start position:0%
behalf but my uh this bill has come
 
01:00:51.289 --> 01:00:51.299 align:start position:0%
before this committee um this bill has
 
01:00:53.089 --> 01:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
been brought forward previously and and
 
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
again uh representative Tanner is here
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
but my understanding in speaking with
 
01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:00.299 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner is the
 
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
the intent is to have the hard copies of
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
the actual book and uh to Echo
 
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative Hughes um question that
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
is a prior practice of the department if
 
01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
that language were to be put in here as
 
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
an amendment the fiscal note would
 
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
change and so the department
 
01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.530 align:start position:0%
change and so the department
is

01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:01:23.329 --> 01:01:23.339 align:start position:0%
the Department's rule is to comply with
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
the law and so if the law says to
 
01:01:27.049 --> 01:01:27.059 align:start position:0%
provide a copy of the book The
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
department will do so
 
01:01:31.069 --> 01:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
but we'll need the the money to to do
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
that we'll need an appropriation in
 
01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
order to effectuate that so
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
the department understands the history
 
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
of this practice the department
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
recognizes the importance of this
 
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
practice but if that language were to be
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
implemented the fiscal note would
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
subsequently change
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just a quick question
 
01:01:53.809 --> 01:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
I mean right now this bill is coming up
 
01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
the out of the policy committee as is
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
with the you know amendments and whatnot
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
I if the policy committee is comfortable
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
with this language I personally don't
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
see why you know we would Tinker with
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
that but just to understand you know
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
what the law says right now if somebody
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
would prefer one of the three options
 
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:17.460 align:start position:0%
would they be able to ask for their
 
01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:19.980 align:start position:0%
preferred option or the with the
 
01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Education say we have a
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
website go search on the website anytime
 
01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:26.339 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to understand your
 
01:02:29.809 --> 01:02:29.819 align:start position:0%
interpretation on how this law would
 
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
require the Department of Education to
 
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh act on this well I will defer your
 
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
question on the language that is before
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
you from the policy committee I will
 
01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
defer to representative I'll be happy to
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
tell you is that
 
01:02:46.609 --> 01:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
the the practice as representative Heath
 
01:02:49.609 --> 01:02:49.619 align:start position:0%
alluded to did change dramatically from
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
providing the actual law book to the
 
01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to saying the
 
01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
information is available on our website
 
01:02:58.970 --> 01:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
or available on a flash drive the books
 
01:03:01.849 --> 01:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
were not available they are available to
 
01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
members of the department so I have one
 
01:03:05.809 --> 01:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
and every year causes great jealousy as
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
I walk through the Halls
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
um but they are not available to the
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
committee members and so we have those
 
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
those other options
 
01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.410 align:start position:0%
those other options
um

01:03:15.410 --> 01:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
the flash drive the the website
 
01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
um but but there is no option I got it
 
01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mary just to reiterate then
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
what I think I'm hearing you say it has
 
01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:30.059 align:start position:0%
been past practice
 
01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
for many many many many years as long as
 
01:03:35.089 --> 01:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
I can remember that the Department of
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
the education committee
 
01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
and those department members that needed
 
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
copies of the law book with copies and I
 
01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
believe it was charged to their regular
 
01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
line of operation it was came out of
 
01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.309 align:start position:0%
line of operation it was came out of
their

01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
or else they just were provided with
 
01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:58.430 align:start position:0%
or else they just were provided with
copies

01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
copies
 
01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:05.420 align:start position:0%
well anyway it was just past practice
 
01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
and that past practice with the current
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
Administration has shifted
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
so that is the purpose of that of this
 
01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
bill is that my understanding
 
01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you that is the shortest
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
answer from a lawyer that has ever been
 
01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
requested I convinced I would just wear
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
it thank you thank you so uh yes you
 
01:04:29.569 --> 01:04:29.579 align:start position:0%
were correct
 
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
any other questions oh yeah I'm looking
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
at the the page that's the fiscal note
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
and it shows a 53 56 000 however it
 
01:04:39.359 --> 01:04:40.329 align:start position:0%
and it shows a 53 56 000 however it
shows

01:04:40.329 --> 01:04:40.339 align:start position:0%
shows
 
01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
424 copies
 
01:04:46.609 --> 01:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
to the House and Senate of the drive and
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
424 copies of the book
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
I don't think nearly that many need to
 
01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
be distributed to the house maybe 28 to
 
01:04:58.849 --> 01:04:58.859 align:start position:0%
the Senate maybe 10 or 15. but you know
 
01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:00.980 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a lot fewer than
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
424 more most people in the house will
 
01:05:06.109 --> 01:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
never even open the book
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
I think that was based on a prior
 
01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:08.930 align:start position:0%
I think that was based on a prior
version

01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
version
 
01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
um and I I did speak with represent
 
01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner of that um about
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
that I think the the bill has been
 
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:18.299 align:start position:0%
amended uh has changed and I I agree
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
with you
 
01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
um that the idea the intent is to
 
01:05:23.809 --> 01:05:23.819 align:start position:0%
provide it to the policy committee and
 
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
it would be far fewer
 
01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:28.069 align:start position:0%
it would be far fewer
um

01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
are we are we talking about that big
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
book that hit the deck a couple weeks
 
01:05:33.119 --> 01:05:35.510 align:start position:0%
book that hit the deck a couple weeks
ago

01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
can that be printed on demand
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
I mean uh anybody have knowledge of this
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
I know there are copy machines being
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
used commercially now where books can be
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
printed on demand they don't inventory
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
oh I know I've seen very thick book
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
especially with the annotations
 
01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.730 align:start position:0%
especially with the annotations
um

01:05:58.730 --> 01:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
I I do know that and again I I hesitate
 
01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
to speak for representative Tanner I'm
 
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:07.140 align:start position:0%
getting nervous here
 
01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:09.059 align:start position:0%
um I know representative Tanner and I
 
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
and if you'd like to join me you're
 
01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:12.980 align:start position:0%
welcome to please do
 
01:06:15.289 --> 01:06:15.299 align:start position:0%
we have talked at length about this
 
01:06:17.569 --> 01:06:17.579 align:start position:0%
issue I know that she's spent a lot of
 
01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
time talking to the publisher which is
 
01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
very admirable
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
um and I know last year there were some
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
concerns about the longevity of the
 
01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
ability for the publisher Thomas Reuters
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
to continue to publish the book
 
01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.430 align:start position:0%
to continue to publish the book
um

01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
but I don't have any personal knowledge
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
of that what I do know is that we're
 
01:06:39.049 --> 01:06:39.059 align:start position:0%
still able to have a physical copy I
 
01:06:40.609 --> 01:06:40.619 align:start position:0%
have a physical copy of the members of
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education has that as
 
01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.970 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education has that as
well

01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:06:45.529 --> 01:06:45.539 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to stop talking for you now
 
01:06:45.539 --> 01:06:47.270 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to stop talking for you now
okay

01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.710 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
um yes I I first of all I want to
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
reiterate that this came out of
 
01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
committee twenty to zero and that
 
01:06:58.490 --> 01:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
um the people in my committee education
 
01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.109 align:start position:0%
um the people in my committee education
committee

01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
guard those books like they're gold I
 
01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:04.619 align:start position:0%
mean one person told me that during
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
vacation they took it home and has
 
01:07:09.049 --> 01:07:09.059 align:start position:0%
started reading it front to back so and
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
it used to be
 
01:07:13.849 --> 01:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
um really really thick when Joe was on
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
the committee really thick and then they
 
01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
narrowed it down to just particularly
 
01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
education laws the thickness of the book
 
01:07:26.349 --> 01:07:26.359 align:start position:0%
had references to the exact uh camps
 
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
Sports Camps that had to have some
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
educational laws affecting them and they
 
01:07:35.089 --> 01:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
took those out so just had it there so
 
01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:37.140 align:start position:0%
what happened was
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
back up a term
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
not this term but the last term
 
01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden for no particular reason
 
01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
we had no books uh coming back meeting
 
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
in person and so I started this search
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
and put in the bill and was sitting like
 
01:07:58.970 --> 01:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
this when a big box came over with the
 
01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
with the books that we were told we
 
01:08:02.809 --> 01:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
couldn't get
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
um but pretty effective yes happened
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
again this year uh because the the bill
 
01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
was uh tabled in the Senate last time
 
01:08:16.150 --> 01:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
this year putting in the same bill boom
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
it happened not while I was doing my
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
testimony but
 
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
before when I came to you know to the
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
room so
 
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
um that was kind of odd and then I
 
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
noticed Diana had her books
 
01:08:34.249 --> 01:08:34.259 align:start position:0%
um also so the books are available and
 
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
they're annotated uh which is fantastic
 
01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
like today we had a question on
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
background checks which I wish you had
 
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
been there for but The annotation goes
 
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
back and and tells when bills were
 
01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
changed and why they were changed and
 
01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
even some court cases that were on them
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
I'm a I'm a retired teacher I don't when
 
01:08:56.329 --> 01:08:56.339 align:start position:0%
I came down here I knew nothing about
 
01:08:59.329 --> 01:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
law I don't know you know I've picked up
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
the now on Jeopardy I even know some of
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
the law questions but
 
01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
um you know I need that book
 
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
I need that book to be able to do my job
 
01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:13.259 align:start position:0%
and that's why this this is in and so we
 
01:09:15.289 --> 01:09:15.299 align:start position:0%
got the got the thing from the
 
01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed with this 58 000 and
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
I'm saying wow I you know just can't
 
01:09:24.169 --> 01:09:24.179 align:start position:0%
imagine that it costs I I expected maybe
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
right but it's it may even be nothing I
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
mean it may be comped uh to the state I
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
haven't worked my way through there but
 
01:09:40.849 --> 01:09:40.859 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire uh you know
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
every one of our offices or have even
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
the the rooms have all the bound books
 
01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
of all the laws and up and upstairs they
 
01:09:51.530 --> 01:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
have that and that's where they make
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
most of their money
 
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
um so anyway and I tried to find out
 
01:09:59.150 --> 01:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
where it was printed and when I went to
 
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
Reuters Thomas Reuters I I went through
 
01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
sales person I went to Publications
 
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
persons I you know went through all
 
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
these things and nobody knew anything
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
about these books so I almost got a uh
 
01:10:14.150 --> 01:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
feeling that it was published or printed
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
locally and I know that the the state
 
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
actually has their own printing
 
01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
um Department printing firm I called
 
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
there and I got pushed around a little
 
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
bit and then they said they'd get back
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
to me and they never got back to me so
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
who knows right now where where it's at
 
01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
but anyway
 
01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
how important these bills are could you
 
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
just help me find the printer that you
 
01:10:39.649 --> 01:10:39.659 align:start position:0%
are talking about I I try to look up
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
Thomas Ruger and I couldn't find the
 
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
printer with that name routers routers
 
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
are you oh Reuters Reuters there you go
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
sorry I completely misunderstood thank
 
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
you yep yep
 
01:10:53.689 --> 01:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
and it's um is it Westfall is the west
 
01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
west law that is also connected with
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
that I think they're a company that's
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
totally together because sometime I got
 
01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
switched on to them as well
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
if anybody had the book who could look
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
I should have brought it with me I
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
actually snuck out of my committee
 
01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:11.060 align:start position:0%
because we're voting on things today
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair can we just go
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
back to the 424 because I don't want one
 
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not gonna need it
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
um what can we do what do you need for
 
01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
you all to do your work there without
 
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
you know people like me who would right
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
not even that was not the intention of
 
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
that bill at all so what would your
 
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
intention be what would you like the the
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
intention was that everybody on House
 
01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
Education and Senate education got the
 
01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
book and got it at this when they first
 
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
were assigned to the committee right
 
01:11:45.169 --> 01:11:45.179 align:start position:0%
that's what it says in the bill and that
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
I would assume I and it's terrible to
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
assume on legislation but that if the
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
finance department
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
section two division two which you deal
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
with education laws that perhaps you
 
01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
might want them as well
 
01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:01.250 align:start position:0%
might want them as well
um

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
but I that would be something that I
 
01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
would think that you would have to
 
01:12:09.649 --> 01:12:09.659 align:start position:0%
this one was very self-serving so I just
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
did it for myself yeah just a follow-up
 
01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
that was my question of responsible for
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
Education because there are a number of
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
committees who would say we have some
 
01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
responsibility towards education uh
 
01:12:22.669 --> 01:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
Judiciary perhaps might have some you
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
know may have a bill where they would
 
01:12:25.729 --> 01:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
want reference to that so this is where
 
01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
I was confused that it wasn't clear to
 
01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
me that it was only the education
 
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
committees especially when it was 424 of
 
01:12:32.209 --> 01:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
them right so that was the clarification
 
01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
I was looking for and this book if you
 
01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
go to the education committee you'll see
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
it on the table with most of the people
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
and mine has sticky notes in it um
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
chairman Lads has sticky notes all over
 
01:12:48.290 --> 01:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
it uh all Caitlyn and and Diana have
 
01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:51.500 align:start position:0%
sticky notes as well oh thank you yeah
 
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
that's his and you can see there's some
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
sticky notes but not as much as mine but
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
um identified in the front of the book
 
01:13:00.719 --> 01:13:13.610 align:start position:0%
um identified in the front of the book
and

01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:14.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:16.729 --> 01:13:16.739 align:start position:0%
you know when when people come in to
 
01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
testify or today when we're working on
 
01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
executing and we had a bill on
 
01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
background checks which I've worked a
 
01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
lot on I could immediately turn to 189
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
and and see it if I had a computer which
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
I have and a little iPad it takes me you
 
01:13:32.689 --> 01:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
know I have to go through this this and
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
this and I get to
 
01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
um a law reference that doesn't have
 
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
annotations and and I have to know the
 
01:13:42.169 --> 01:13:42.179 align:start position:0%
specific chapter and verse of it in
 
01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
order to find it
 
01:13:46.729 --> 01:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
here I can just read through it yes
 
01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so
 
01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
if we would uh Tinker with the language
 
01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
of the bill to make it uh you know a bit
 
01:13:55.729 --> 01:13:55.739 align:start position:0%
more specific in terms of how many
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
copies of the book would be required say
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
you know you've got 20 people on the
 
01:14:03.050 --> 01:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
education committee say another seven or
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
eight in various leadership you know
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
positions and the Senate education
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
committee and maybe Finance too would
 
01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.149 align:start position:0%
committee and maybe Finance too would
you

01:14:11.149 --> 01:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
feel that that you know fulfills the
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
spirit of your bill because as you know
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
the sponsor I want to make sure that I
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
understand what the intent is would that
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
be compatible consistent with what you
 
01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
were trying to do I definitely I mean my
 
01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
like I said mine was purely self-serving
 
01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
uh to start out with and then all of a
 
01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
sudden grew to 424 which I didn't have
 
01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
any idea how that happened but you know
 
01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
I think uh for example Judiciary uh
 
01:14:42.649 --> 01:14:42.659 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't deal with education in
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
the depth that our committee and the
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
senate committee in your committee does
 
01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
where we on a daily basis we're actually
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
looking at these laws for them they're
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
they're uh
 
01:14:57.229 --> 01:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
committee resource person could probably
 
01:14:59.090 --> 01:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
you know they could say to them could
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
you look up the you know the laws for
 
01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
this specific Bill and it would only
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
happen a few times maybe uh in terms I
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
got it thank you and by the way see you
 
01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
testify on this and begin a book shows
 
01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:11.810 align:start position:0%
testify on this and begin a book shows
up

01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you same thing
 
01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
book fairy you know just it happens
 
01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:20.540 align:start position:0%
it did didn't it
 
01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Linda
 
01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
for taking my representative for taking
 
01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
my questions
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
um I have to say I am
 
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
a little disgruntled that we have to
 
01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
create a bill
 
01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
for people to get for the education
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
committee to get their law book and for
 
01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
members of the Department of Education
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
um I just want to have that noted for
 
01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
the record
 
01:15:45.890 --> 01:15:45.900 align:start position:0%
um because I find it very disturbing
 
01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:48.179 align:start position:0%
that a precedent that has been in place
 
01:15:50.209 --> 01:15:50.219 align:start position:0%
for probably
 
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
as many years as the Department of
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
Education has been there um and it just
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
seemed like a logical thing that people
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
need and when I talk to OLS they didn't
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
he didn't seem to know what I was
 
01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
talking about he said oh yeah I've got
 
01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
them all here they're going right over
 
01:16:08.209 --> 01:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
um and I so I don't understand so I'm
 
01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
troubled by that but I would certainly
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
be happy to support this thank you very
 
01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.189 align:start position:0%
be happy to support this thank you very
much

01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
and thank you and I I just want to also
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
point out that you know in in years past
 
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
because this is my fifth term
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
um we've also had a lot more support
 
01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
from having a secretary uh you know or a
 
01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
resource person just for education I
 
01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
mean we've got over 100 bills this year
 
01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
and it's hard that they're cutting back
 
01:16:37.729 --> 01:16:37.739 align:start position:0%
on Staffing and um you know I feel sorry
 
01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
for Gen 4 and it's I I almost feel very
 
01:16:43.729 --> 01:16:43.739 align:start position:0%
hesitant asking her to do research
 
01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
because she's got so much honor plate
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
from different committees so
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
this helps everybody else
 
01:17:03.729 --> 01:17:03.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
one thing leads to another right well
 
01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for letting me
 
01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:14.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
I almost that's what I was going to say
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
or a hundred I mean just put it on 50.
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
you need to say 10 bucks
 
01:17:28.679 --> 01:17:30.830 align:start position:0%
you need to say 10 bucks
oh

01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
well it's 112. right but if some other
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
reps it gee I'd be interested and you
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
say give me 10 bucks right
 
01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
but if it's free I'll take it they need
 
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
a store a door stop I'll donate a brick
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
um well my my question was
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
well I don't want to no
 
01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that people by
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
printing for the state know who got on
 
01:18:04.189 --> 01:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
demand publishing capabilities so I
 
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:11.689 --> 01:18:11.699 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard was it came from a
 
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
discretionary fund which got eliminated
 
01:18:17.209 --> 01:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason but there's still a
 
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
line item for publishing or printing or
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
and they still send one to every
 
01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.550 align:start position:0%
and they still send one to every
superintendent

01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
is oh really that's what I heard
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
and that's what's in here is it
 
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have a this would just be
 
01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
I guess an amendment that has no money
 
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
attached to it to say that the
 
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Education will provide
 
01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
this Senate and House Education
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
committees with the laws and is that am
 
01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
I going to get you know this um pillar
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
read because that's an unfunded mandate
 
01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
or can we just say that the Department
 
01:18:48.649 --> 01:18:48.659 align:start position:0%
of Education
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
should provide them with a with a book
 
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
that they could they can find fifty
 
01:18:57.290 --> 01:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
thousand huh yeah but now I would
 
01:18:59.090 --> 01:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
suggest if that's appropriate well I
 
01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
think that's what this is
 
01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
I mean that's that's basically what this
 
01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.930 align:start position:0%
I mean that's that's basically what this
says

01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:08.810 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:10.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
it didn't need to come here in its
 
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
current form because right now the
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
department can provide those laws
 
01:19:20.570 --> 01:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
through the flash drive or you know
 
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
online stuff without an expense I think
 
01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
the reason why it still ended up here
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
besides the fact it had an offend was
 
01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.130 align:start position:0%
besides the fact it had an offend was
that

01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
you know we are right now being
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
basically asked to get it to change the
 
01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
language to go back to hard copies
 
01:19:36.169 --> 01:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
should be provided which this language
 
01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
does not require it provides it as an
 
01:19:41.689 --> 01:19:41.699 align:start position:0%
option so if we so decide to change the
 
01:19:43.850 --> 01:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
text of the law to say you know hard
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
copy you know then that would require
 
01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:50.219 align:start position:0%
changing the language and changing the
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact by determining how many
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
books we'd like to see and how they
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
would be distributed and frankly I would
 
01:19:57.890 --> 01:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
suggest that instead of saying this
 
01:19:59.689 --> 01:19:59.699 align:start position:0%
committee that committee that committee
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
maybe we can just say hey there are so
 
01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
many people on education so many people
 
01:20:07.130 --> 01:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
on the Senate education so many people
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
are now on finance too and you know add
 
01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
a few more books and you know say a
 
01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
total of 50 or whatever be given to the
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
house and the senator something like
 
01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
that if we really want to Tinker at this
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
level but right now the way the law is
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
written it has no fiscal note because it
 
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
does not require a hard copy
 
01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
I think what we're trying to do is
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
and the more specific specificity we get
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
in it the worse off it's going to be
 
01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:39.110 align:start position:0%
in it the worse off it's going to be
so

01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:42.649 --> 01:20:42.659 align:start position:0%
if if this is passed just like it is all
 
01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
it is is taken away even a flag and
 
01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
saying we think you ought to have some
 
01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
hard copies
 
01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:49.070 align:start position:0%
hard copies
uh

01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:51.169 --> 01:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
uh and that that again that's a
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
management decision
 
01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.050 align:start position:0%
management decision
so

01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's where I am with this I
 
01:21:01.630 --> 01:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I think it would be appropriate
 
01:21:07.010 --> 01:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
to make a motion to retain and uh you
 
01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
know talk to the DOA and see how we can
 
01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
deal with this because maybe we can take
 
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
care of this without needing to pass
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
along it or maybe a law will be needed
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
but I would like to you know have a work
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
session with a doe and just understand
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
exactly what's the issue okay we have a
 
01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
motion to retain
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:31.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:48.890 --> 01:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.229 --> 01:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
okay well right we have four to retain
 
01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
how many people don't want to retain the
 
01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:56.990 align:start position:0%
how many people don't want to retain the
bill

01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
so it's four to two uh four to three
 
01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
four to three so thank God it would yeah
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
we'll retain it
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
now we need to keep track of football
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
could I have a second
 
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
the second was Mary I don't know I'm
 
01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
saying a second right now if we have
 
01:22:16.729 --> 01:22:16.739 align:start position:0%
agreement to pass this I would prefer to
 
01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
pass it as well because it it again it
 
01:22:23.570 --> 01:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
has been past precedent that
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
certain number of copies of the
 
01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
education book have been passed out and
 
01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
you're right a management issue but
 
01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
in fact he may require that it be
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
legislated we've run into this problem
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
before so I think it's very unfortunate
 
01:22:45.229 --> 01:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
that we have to pass a bill like this
 
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
but it seems that it makes more sense so
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
I would like to take back my vote and I
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
would vote with representative Weiler
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
let's just have a motion to reconsider
 
01:22:57.649 --> 01:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
yes a motion to reconsider okay and all
 
01:22:59.330 --> 01:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
this in favor of reconsideration sure
 
01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
okay now we have a motion to pass along
 
01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:05.209 align:start position:0%
okay now we have a motion to pass along
OTP

01:23:05.209 --> 01:23:05.219 align:start position:0%
OTP
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
01:23:21.169 --> 01:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
okay unanimous I would like to make a
 
01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
quick note though that what we pass does
 
01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
not require a hard copy that's right
 
01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
that's all no he doesn't it says that
 
01:23:29.930 --> 01:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
there are three
 
01:23:32.450 --> 01:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
I did
 
01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:33.649 align:start position:0%
I did
or

01:23:33.649 --> 01:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:23:33.659 --> 01:23:37.610 align:start position:0%
or
or

01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:39.719 align:start position:0%
it's either of the three
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:46.930 --> 01:23:46.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:52.250 --> 01:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
give me the printing
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
I've done them before in division
 
01:23:58.370 --> 01:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
oh sorry I tried to get one this time we
 
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
did well nobody obviously because
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
supposing this discretionary fund
 
01:24:07.149 --> 01:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
you gotta look at me
 
01:24:12.410 --> 01:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
okay in order of March 521 is our next
 
01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:16.729 align:start position:0%
okay in order of March 521 is our next
bill

01:24:16.729 --> 01:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
do we have anybody this wants to talk to
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
anybody that can explain it to us
 
01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.390 align:start position:0%
anybody that can explain it to us
yeah

01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.890 --> 01:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:36.610 --> 01:24:36.620 align:start position:0%
placement at for an episode of treatment
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're doing 521 yes that's mine
 
01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
I didn't I'll defer I'll be done you can
 
01:24:54.169 --> 01:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
I'm Jennifer doll of director of special
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
education for New Boston in Goffstown
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I've worked throughout
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
the state in this role as well and I
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
didn't come with anything prepared I was
 
01:25:06.050 --> 01:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
just informed today that this was coming
 
01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:07.130 align:start position:0%
just informed today that this was coming
up

01:25:07.130 --> 01:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
so um just real quickly and thinking
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
about funding that goes towards special
 
01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
ed it was really interesting listening
 
01:25:16.490 --> 01:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
to the last you know half hour or so we
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
get revenues from three sources we get
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid that comes through
 
01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
adequacy it doesn't come to the special
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
ed Department I don't think there'll be
 
01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
any gamesmanship about wanting you know
 
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
2000 considering the cost of the
 
01:25:31.850 --> 01:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
educating a child with special education
 
01:25:34.850 --> 01:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
which is 35 to 45 000 based on the
 
01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
recent assessment that the state did
 
01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
it's really just kind of moving chairs
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
on the Titanic but um this um so we have
 
01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
um we have the differentiated Aid we
 
01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
have chapter 402 which is now quarter
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
replacement revenue and then we have
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
um the special ed Aid which used to be
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid so this one this new
 
01:25:58.850 --> 01:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
policy or practice that's been developed
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
is wonderful it's it's getting services
 
01:26:02.689 --> 01:26:02.699 align:start position:0%
to children who need it dearly
 
01:26:04.850 --> 01:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
desperately and they're getting into
 
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
placements there's just no
 
01:26:09.649 --> 01:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
um structure as to who's going to fund
 
01:26:09.659 --> 01:26:10.729 align:start position:0%
um structure as to who's going to fund
it

01:26:10.729 --> 01:26:10.739 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
um and so in the past any court order
 
01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
placement there there was a Structure
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
there was a decision the Ashland
 
01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
decision years ago which forced
 
01:26:22.129 --> 01:26:22.139 align:start position:0%
legislation so
 
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:24.780 align:start position:0%
So currently I mean our charge in
 
01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
education and our responsibility to the
 
01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
town we work in is to appropriately
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
Place students based on their needs
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
and if in fact it's required by special
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
education to fund the educational
 
01:26:36.239 --> 01:26:37.850 align:start position:0%
education to fund the educational
portion

01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
portion
 
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
um so these students are placed
 
01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
really outside of the special ed process
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
and then the districts have to pick up
 
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
the full cost of the special ed funding
 
01:26:49.729 --> 01:26:49.739 align:start position:0%
which is the full day school so if a
 
01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
child without a disability is placed the
 
01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:53.219 align:start position:0%
school district doesn't fund anything
 
01:26:54.890 --> 01:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
but if a child with a disability is
 
01:26:57.410 --> 01:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
placed it costs us anywhere from 75 to
 
01:27:00.169 --> 01:27:00.179 align:start position:0%
80 000 annually I've had three in my
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
district this year some that last
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
several years so it's it's new it's a
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's a valuable I think practice
 
01:27:10.610 --> 01:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
um but there's just no structure to it
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
and we can't anticipate the costs so a
 
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
small District like New Boston you know
 
01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
gets hit with three kids and that just
 
01:27:21.290 --> 01:27:21.300 align:start position:0%
blows blows things up so I think um you
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
know uh just considering those those
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources
 
01:27:25.679 --> 01:27:27.110 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources
um

01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
is very challenging and again those go
 
01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
to the adequacy level or they go to the
 
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
district they don't necessarily go to
 
01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
special education
 
01:27:35.159 --> 01:27:37.010 align:start position:0%
special education
and

01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
question what is an episode of treatment
 
01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
can you describe it not really I mean
 
01:27:44.689 --> 01:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
this was this is what um if a child's in
 
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
crisis it's through DHHS and dcyf if a
 
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
child's in crisis
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
um and the state needs to place them so
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
they get the services they need they
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
call it an episode of treatment it was
 
01:27:57.290 --> 01:27:57.300 align:start position:0%
just a name I think that was given so a
 
01:27:59.330 --> 01:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
child I think intentionally it was
 
01:28:02.090 --> 01:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a 60 to 90 day placement
 
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
but this turns into you know multiple
 
01:28:07.129 --> 01:28:07.139 align:start position:0%
years in some situations
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
um so and it's it's all new it's all
 
01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
within the last couple of years so an
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
episode of treatment is just what we
 
01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
call so what the state does is it's
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
hired a third party vendor to determine
 
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
who which child needs placement that's
 
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
Maxim and so this third party vendor
 
01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
does an assessment and determines
 
01:28:28.129 --> 01:28:28.139 align:start position:0%
whether a child needs a placement and
 
01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
then figuring out who's going to fund it
 
01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
is the biggest challenge
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
about Medicaid for schools do they ever
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
cover any of this Medicaid for schools
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
we've lost millions in the last couple
 
01:28:39.169 --> 01:28:39.179 align:start position:0%
of years
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
um that's a whole different story
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
um no I I don't think we could build
 
01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for schools we've
 
01:28:47.629 --> 01:28:47.639 align:start position:0%
um that's changed considered sounds like
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
a medical condition
 
01:28:52.729 --> 01:28:52.739 align:start position:0%
well it it in many cases it's a family
 
01:28:54.890 --> 01:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
situation right so it's a situation
 
01:28:58.669 --> 01:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
where the family is struggling and with
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
mental health issues or Finance issues
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
or something and the child is really you
 
01:29:04.430 --> 01:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
know needs to be somewhere to get
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
support and and regulation
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
um so it's wonderful the States you know
 
01:29:11.570 --> 01:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
doing this now because there's so many
 
01:29:14.090 --> 01:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
kids with so much need I think it's just
 
01:29:15.770 --> 01:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
adding some structure to who's going to
 
01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
fund it and it was really schools were
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
not involved in in the decision making
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
regarding this so it came as a surprise
 
01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
and has had an impact on out of District
 
01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:26.649 align:start position:0%
and has had an impact on out of District
budget

01:29:26.649 --> 01:29:26.659 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:29:31.070 --> 01:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
dcyf get involved it is a dcyf DHHS
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
program so there's a new Bureau called
 
01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
The Bureau of Behavioral Health I
 
01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:36.169 align:start position:0%
The Bureau of Behavioral Health I
believe

01:29:36.169 --> 01:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
they pretty much have hired a vendor I
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
think to do the work
 
01:29:44.209 --> 01:29:44.219 align:start position:0%
um and uh so if we have a child that we
 
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
need that we feel needs or anybody a
 
01:29:48.770 --> 01:29:48.780 align:start position:0%
doctor a parent needs placement or is in
 
01:29:51.169 --> 01:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
crisis they have to
 
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
um request a cat assessment in this
 
01:29:55.729 --> 01:29:55.739 align:start position:0%
third party vendor administers the cat
 
01:29:58.129 --> 01:29:58.139 align:start position:0%
assessment and determines where a child
 
01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
needs to go if I could just as just to
 
01:30:03.290 --> 01:30:03.300 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative Euler's
 
01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:04.980 align:start position:0%
question as a corresponder of the bill
 
01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
the definition for episode of treatment
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
is right at the beginning of this it's
 
01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
adding the you know Roman numeral seven
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
to the existing definitions and it
 
01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
basically refers to a situation where
 
01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
DHHS makes the decision the local school
 
01:30:20.570 --> 01:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
Authority you know this is a placement
 
01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:27.530 --> 01:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
no go ahead DHHS will tell you that it's
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
a cat it has to go through the cat the
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
third party vendor so it's not really
 
01:30:35.209 --> 01:30:35.219 align:start position:0%
it's hard it's hard to untangle but yes
 
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a DHHS DS d-wise and because
 
01:30:41.629 --> 01:30:41.639 align:start position:0%
the state you know creates those
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
policies and requests them to be
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
implemented and really the school local
 
01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
school districts don't have much to say
 
01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:51.719 align:start position:0%
in this you know then we do have an
 
01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
obligation to also fund it otherwise it
 
01:30:56.209 --> 01:30:56.219 align:start position:0%
becomes a 28 day issue where we tell the
 
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:57.719 align:start position:0%
schools you have to do exactly this and
 
01:30:58.910 --> 01:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
by the way you don't even get to make
 
01:31:01.129 --> 01:31:01.139 align:start position:0%
the decision we tell you and which is
 
01:31:03.290 --> 01:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
again it's good policy because it is a
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
useful policy it serves kids in needs
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
but because the decision is made at the
 
01:31:09.470 --> 01:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
state level the intent of this bill is
 
01:31:11.149 --> 01:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
to match the funding you know whether
 
01:31:12.770 --> 01:31:12.780 align:start position:0%
places where the decisions are being
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
made and make sure the funding for
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
specifically for those episodes of
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
treatments ordered under this policy are
 
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
also covered by you know the state who
 
01:31:23.689 --> 01:31:23.699 align:start position:0%
is making the decisions that's in a
 
01:31:25.729 --> 01:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
nutshell this bill well it's got a
 
01:31:27.290 --> 01:31:27.300 align:start position:0%
fiscal note but it doesn't have any
 
01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:29.270 align:start position:0%
fiscal note but it doesn't have any
costs

01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:31:34.610 --> 01:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
the costs are significant I mean can't
 
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
to cheer could I just ask I don't
 
01:31:38.570 --> 01:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
understand what cat is
 
01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
so um this agency Maxim has an
 
01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:43.129 align:start position:0%
so um this agency Maxim has an
assessment

01:31:43.129 --> 01:31:43.139 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:31:45.169 --> 01:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
um and it's a you know protected
 
01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
assessment so we don't really know what
 
01:31:47.709 --> 01:31:47.719 align:start position:0%
it's all about
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
so they interview folks involved and
 
01:31:52.189 --> 01:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
make a decision there's been times when
 
01:31:54.970 --> 01:31:54.980 align:start position:0%
the school hasn't even been involved so
 
01:31:57.649 --> 01:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
so no it's it's a different it's a
 
01:31:59.090 --> 01:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
different assessment that was developed
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
so can I give an example so um
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
for example a family has a child who is
 
01:32:10.010 --> 01:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
out of control they call the police the
 
01:32:12.050 --> 01:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
police come
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
they don't know what to do there isn't a
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
place to send the child
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
um so is is this what we're talking
 
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
about this is an episodic or it could be
 
01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
a child that's severely severely
 
01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
depressed and suicidal in which many
 
01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
situations are about children who are
 
01:32:31.010 --> 01:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
suicidal and the safety is critical so
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
they need to they need to be in a
 
01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
therapeutic setting uh we unfortunately
 
01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
this doesn't necessarily Place students
 
01:32:39.290 --> 01:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
in you know therapeutic settings that
 
01:32:41.090 --> 01:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
have psychiatrists and so forth but I
 
01:32:43.370 --> 01:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
think that's the plan
 
01:32:46.970 --> 01:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
so once upon a time
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
when I used to work in your school
 
01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:50.510 align:start position:0%
when I used to work in your school
district

01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
um we had kind of like a sort of like a
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
chance yeah that seems to have gone away
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
I I don't I can't speak so the quarter
 
01:32:59.870 --> 01:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
placements have gone down considerably
 
01:33:01.970 --> 01:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
and that was where children would be
 
01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:03.350 align:start position:0%
and that was where children would be
placed

01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
placed
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
um children in need and you know through
 
01:33:07.729 --> 01:33:07.739 align:start position:0%
whatever venue or Avenue
 
01:33:09.410 --> 01:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
um and we would fund that through what I
 
01:33:11.810 --> 01:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
called the chapter 402 which is anything
 
01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
above three times the cost we would uh
 
01:33:17.629 --> 01:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
the state would pick up so this is good
 
01:33:19.729 --> 01:33:19.739 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:33:22.729 --> 01:33:22.739 align:start position:0%
so we really do we have an estimated
 
01:33:25.610 --> 01:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
number of students that this impacts it
 
01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
could be it could vary and it could vary
 
01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
by I would expect that my city of
 
01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
Manchester has a large number of
 
01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
students that would relate here yes and
 
01:33:38.209 --> 01:33:38.219 align:start position:0%
and yes
 
01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
and currently the school district is
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
carrying that burden the school district
 
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.250 align:start position:0%
carrying that burden the school district
um

01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
is carrying I I don't know how the
 
01:33:51.290 --> 01:33:51.300 align:start position:0%
school district is dealing with it
 
01:33:52.970 --> 01:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
um it like I said there's no structure
 
01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:55.139 align:start position:0%
to this so we'll sit down at the table
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
and say this kid is in such trouble but
 
01:34:00.290 --> 01:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
we're we're allocating local funds to a
 
01:34:02.270 --> 01:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
situation that may not be you know I
 
01:34:04.129 --> 01:34:04.139 align:start position:0%
mean that is bigger and may not even be
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
educationally related so I would imagine
 
01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
the biggest cities in the state and
 
01:34:11.570 --> 01:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
Rochester and Claremont are having this
 
01:34:13.970 --> 01:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
is happening in in you know areas where
 
01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
there's some struggle economically and
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:23.930 --> 01:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
is your average District I would say and
 
01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
and we've got three students currently
 
01:34:28.370 --> 01:34:28.380 align:start position:0%
and one that just came back up one that
 
01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
just came back and two others so
 
01:34:33.410 --> 01:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
so how do we come up with the dollar
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
figure for this because it's really
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
we are living in a Time
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
kids have been impacted by covid
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
um there are a lot of apparently mental
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
health issues that have increased
 
01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.590 align:start position:0%
health issues that have increased
significantly

01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
01:34:51.490 --> 01:34:51.500 align:start position:0%
um at public hearings I heard
 
01:34:55.490 --> 01:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
unbelievable testimony from families in
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
crisis over this situation
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
um how do we how do we can I handle
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
around what it what's its shape
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
so I think this is this is one is on
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to unpack given that
 
01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
there's a third party vendor and it's
 
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
hard to get information about what's
 
01:35:12.649 --> 01:35:12.659 align:start position:0%
going on with that but I can tell you
 
01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
with all seriousness I've got students
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
in crisis and parents will send me
 
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
letters saying I can't get an
 
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
appointment until September or October
 
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
and they're suicidal right now so I it's
 
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
a really huge issue
 
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
um and I think you know
 
01:35:30.649 --> 01:35:30.659 align:start position:0%
there's Mo I'm pleased that the state is
 
01:35:33.709 --> 01:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
has put together a way for families in
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
crisis to um to get some help it's just
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
there's a long list of kids for this and
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
um it's having an impact on
 
01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:42.189 align:start position:0%
um it's having an impact on
funding

01:35:42.189 --> 01:35:42.199 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:47.460 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh yeah I uh I was on
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
a school board in Farmington we had
 
01:35:52.129 --> 01:35:52.139 align:start position:0%
something like uh 22 to 25 out of
 
01:35:52.139 --> 01:35:53.450 align:start position:0%
something like uh 22 to 25 out of
districts

01:35:53.450 --> 01:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:35:56.510 --> 01:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
and at a cost of uh over a million
 
01:35:57.890 --> 01:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
dollars about ninety five thousand
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
dollars per student
 
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
and it was it was quite a burden I mean
 
01:36:03.050 --> 01:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
when you figure there's only 900
 
01:36:04.850 --> 01:36:04.860 align:start position:0%
students so we got a 14 million dollar
 
01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
budget so that was special Aid cost was
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
4.6 million dollars
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
I mean it takes away from your
 
01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
mainstream kits and that's and that's
 
01:36:17.930 --> 01:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
you know the Indian some of you don't
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
have any choice with court ordered which
 
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
I believe a 402's exactly yeah it used
 
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
to be called 402 now we call it court
 
01:36:26.810 --> 01:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
ordered yeah oh oh just court ordered it
 
01:36:29.810 --> 01:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
it was called that chapter 402. um and
 
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary that's costs are
 
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
extraordinary if you look at the big
 
01:36:35.629 --> 01:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
cities even the moderate districts the
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
auto District costs are very very high
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
do we do we have any idea what the
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
popular you know what population that
 
01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
affects in other words like special ed
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
is around thirty thousand
 
01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:49.860 align:start position:0%
so special is um
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
said it's been increasing at the state
 
01:36:54.770 --> 01:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
level um the number of kids hasn't
 
01:36:56.570 --> 01:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
changed when you count the number of
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
kids with special education it's
 
01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
including all kids in charter schools
 
01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
it's including kids in private schools
 
01:37:05.209 --> 01:37:05.219 align:start position:0%
because leas have to have responsibility
 
01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
for all of these kids so the number
 
01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
comparably to students without
 
01:37:11.689 --> 01:37:11.699 align:start position:0%
disabilities is changing because those
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
kids are moving into other areas right
 
01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
but we're still responsible for kids
 
01:37:17.330 --> 01:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
whether they go somewhere else or not
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's why the number
 
01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
pair it appears as though while the
 
01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
general population is shrinking
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
um the kids with disabilities are
 
01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
increasing but what's happening is the
 
01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
general proper population is moving into
 
01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
other avenues for education but the
 
01:37:33.229 --> 01:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
local Lea is still responsible
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
financially for students
 
01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
um which is very in charter schools for
 
01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:41.159 align:start position:0%
example we have no control over what
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
occurs how you know but we're fully
 
01:37:45.169 --> 01:37:45.179 align:start position:0%
responsible and if somebody were to take
 
01:37:46.850 --> 01:37:46.860 align:start position:0%
us to court it would be the District of
 
01:37:48.649 --> 01:37:48.659 align:start position:0%
liability that would have to go to court
 
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
and defend fape
 
01:37:52.490 --> 01:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
right now as a charter school have you
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
are you ever contracted by the Lea to to
 
01:37:58.970 --> 01:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
provide services so I I work for I'm at
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
the SAU in a public District so okay so
 
01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
when we have contracts with Charter
 
01:38:05.689 --> 01:38:05.699 align:start position:0%
Schools they hire people
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
um or we find people from contract
 
01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
agencies to send in
 
01:38:12.530 --> 01:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
um so we're responsible for funding
 
01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
whatever occurs in that IEP
 
01:38:15.239 --> 01:38:16.430 align:start position:0%
whatever occurs in that IEP
um

01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
again is that your question well well
 
01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's in other words well I I know I
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
was going over to manifest and uh one of
 
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
our students from Farmington was at uh
 
01:38:30.770 --> 01:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
uh a Catholic School in Rochester and I
 
01:38:33.050 --> 01:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
noticed on a man on the manifesto hey
 
01:38:34.490 --> 01:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
what's what's this doing there and they
 
01:38:36.890 --> 01:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
were providing Services yeah so I mean
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's it does happen and uh it's
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
quite significant oh yeah there's a
 
01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
large population of students that are
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
and and our our student population is
 
01:38:49.149 --> 01:38:49.159 align:start position:0%
around 22 to 24 percent
 
01:38:53.090 --> 01:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
of in special ed which is that's
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
pretty significant and I think it's it's
 
01:38:58.250 --> 01:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
um in many districts gotten up that high
 
01:39:01.070 --> 01:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
so right now are we seeing any measure
 
01:39:03.050 --> 01:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
of uh increase in academic achievement
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
through this or I mean you know it's
 
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
it seems so we never I and that and
 
01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's a question I'm on the budget
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee also there and you always ask
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
the question well how many kids come off
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
a special ed and you never seem to see
 
01:39:18.290 --> 01:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
many come off especially well I can tell
 
01:39:21.530 --> 01:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
you it's very challenging to get a valid
 
01:39:24.110 --> 01:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh estimate of achievement meaning that
 
01:39:25.970 --> 01:39:25.980 align:start position:0%
the state assessments that we use are
 
01:39:28.250 --> 01:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
not Norm referenced or standardized
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
there it's a bar you jump over right so
 
01:39:34.250 --> 01:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
the best predictor of the state predicts
 
01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
the socioeconomic the state assessment
 
01:39:38.169 --> 01:39:38.179 align:start position:0%
is very good at predicting this
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic status of a community
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
other than that it's a little
 
01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
wishy-washy right so I mean comparing
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
Bedford to um
 
01:39:49.490 --> 01:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
comparing Bedford to Berlin
 
01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:50.090 align:start position:0%
comparing Bedford to Berlin
um

01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:53.570 --> 01:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
we know that uh you know the what occurs
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
in the home plays a big role in
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
education and what resources are
 
01:39:59.570 --> 01:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
available so uh the best predictor of
 
01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic status is our state
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
assessments it's not it's not a
 
01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
predictor of student achievement meaning
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
if you've got a child that's deaf or
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
blind or uh very cognitively impaired or
 
01:40:13.610 --> 01:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
so that test is just not going to give
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
you any any measurement of of you know
 
01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
true achievement
 
01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
right well if if I'm honorable thanks uh
 
01:40:26.209 --> 01:40:26.219 align:start position:0%
no I believe I've seen a a uh a scatter
 
01:40:29.570 --> 01:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
diagram of uh free reduced this was in
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
both schools I believe and was brought
 
01:40:33.770 --> 01:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
up at a National Conference actually
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
which was kind of neat and it showed
 
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
that even if you were poor
 
01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:42.179 align:start position:0%
the it did you know you still could
 
01:40:44.750 --> 01:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
achieve at a very high level so
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
I'll be honest with you I did my
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
dissertation on education funding in New
 
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
funding uh is associated with three
 
01:40:57.110 --> 01:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
factors poverty urbanicity which is both
 
01:41:01.850 --> 01:41:01.860 align:start position:0%
um you know sitting uh and spending so
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
um achievement I'm sorry is is very
 
01:41:05.689 --> 01:41:05.699 align:start position:0%
connected to or you can predict
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
achievement based on socioeconomic
 
01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:09.830 align:start position:0%
achievement based on socioeconomic
status

01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
status
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
um urbanicity because there's different
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
complexities in an urban setting
 
01:41:17.090 --> 01:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
um and uh per pupil spending those are
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
the three factors in in my estimate
 
01:41:20.510 --> 01:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
contribute the most to student
 
01:41:23.209 --> 01:41:23.219 align:start position:0%
achievement so I I also study that
 
01:41:26.810 --> 01:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
Kuwait uh intentionally and there's a
 
01:41:29.629 --> 01:41:29.639 align:start position:0%
Lexington Institute study of uh Abbott
 
01:41:32.689 --> 01:41:32.699 align:start position:0%
districts in New Jersey and they spend
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
forty four thousand dollars per student
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
and their academic achievement is
 
01:41:39.189 --> 01:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
actually going down and that's that's
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
unbelievable that that is unbelievable
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh thank you can I ask a
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
few either or or yes no questions
 
01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
because I'm having a hard time
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
understanding this whole thing frankly
 
01:41:52.609 --> 01:41:52.619 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you first thanks for that
 
01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
um are these court ordered
 
01:41:57.960 --> 01:41:59.629 align:start position:0%
um are these court ordered
children

01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:42:01.850 --> 01:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
who need an episode of treatment or
 
01:42:03.649 --> 01:42:03.659 align:start position:0%
these two separate things court ordered
 
01:42:05.209 --> 01:42:05.219 align:start position:0%
and is episode treatment so they're
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
separate so they're these are not court
 
01:42:09.050 --> 01:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
ordered children these are not involved
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
with court ordered placements okay just
 
01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
let me
 
01:42:15.590 --> 01:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
one at a time okay so these are children
 
01:42:17.570 --> 01:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
who have somewhere there's been an
 
01:42:18.770 --> 01:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
episode of treatment you gave the
 
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
example of a student who's severely
 
01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:22.679 align:start position:0%
depressed and the parents like you know
 
01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
help me I don't know what to do
 
01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:26.870 align:start position:0%
help me I don't know what to do
um

01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
how is that addressed how is that being
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
I guess uh let me think how is that
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
being addressed now
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
and why would DHHS
 
01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
get involved If the parents are saying
 
01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
my kid is depressed as opposed to why is
 
01:42:46.010 --> 01:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
DHHS involved in this who are these kids
 
01:42:47.689 --> 01:42:47.699 align:start position:0%
where DHHS gets involved my
 
01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
understanding what I thought I
 
01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
understood at first is that somehow
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
these are children that are housed with
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
it not housed physically but
 
01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:56.649 align:start position:0%
it not housed physically but
um

01:42:56.649 --> 01:42:56.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:59.689 --> 01:42:59.699 align:start position:0%
educationally dhss has responsibility
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
over these children do they have
 
01:43:03.530 --> 01:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
responsibility over these children no I
 
01:43:06.350 --> 01:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
think the state calls it a parent choice
 
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
so the parent has chosen to access have
 
01:43:14.090 --> 01:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
DHHS intervene with this with this child
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
correct and DHHS says again get out DHHS
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
I know um
 
01:43:22.370 --> 01:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
um says we're going to do this cat thing
 
01:43:25.010 --> 01:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
and figure out what you need and then
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
DHHS based on this cat thing
 
01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
says you're going to go to this school
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
and get this treatment and the problem
 
01:43:34.250 --> 01:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
that you're seeing is that no one is
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
paying for that treatment or the school
 
01:43:38.570 --> 01:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
is getting stuck with that payment so
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
the to that am I kind of on the right
 
01:43:43.370 --> 01:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
track here yes okay can I I'll give you
 
01:43:45.709 --> 01:43:45.719 align:start position:0%
an example A Child's Very um
 
01:43:48.290 --> 01:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
the problem with suicidality is there's
 
01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
no placements for kids really so many
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
are going out of state or somewhere else
 
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
but if a child is in crisis behaviorally
 
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
very young often the kids will be
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
pleasant Mount Prospect Academy up north
 
01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
and it's costly so the state will pick
 
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
up the cost of the residents and then
 
01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
the educational portion would then
 
01:44:09.229 --> 01:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
become the responsibility of the school
 
01:44:09.239 --> 01:44:12.649 align:start position:0%
become the responsibility of the school
district

01:44:12.649 --> 01:44:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:15.530 --> 01:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
so is are this so you're talking about
 
01:44:17.330 --> 01:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
this child who was removed from the
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
family and moved to this residential are
 
01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
all these children moved to a
 
01:44:23.689 --> 01:44:23.699 align:start position:0%
residential place I guess part of that
 
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
question is if a child is divorced or
 
01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:27.890 align:start position:0%
question is if a child is divorced or
depressed

01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
depressed
 
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
what can the school do um there's not a
 
01:44:32.930 --> 01:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
one-off here in terms of an episode of
 
01:44:35.689 --> 01:44:35.699 align:start position:0%
treatment that treatment of depression
 
01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
is a long-term kind of a treatment so do
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
the all these kids go to a residential
 
01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
Place through DHHS so um prior to being
 
01:44:45.590 --> 01:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
placed there's fast forward so there's
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
some uh so this these are kids that the
 
01:44:50.030 --> 01:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
schools you know we would argue and
 
01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
probably not in all cases but that the
 
01:44:54.410 --> 01:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
schools are able to manage these kids
 
01:44:56.330 --> 01:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
it's easier almost at school when you're
 
01:44:58.010 --> 01:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
dealing with kids we've got therapists
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
psychologists and so forth but it's when
 
01:45:02.209 --> 01:45:02.219 align:start position:0%
they leave school that is problematic
 
01:45:05.689 --> 01:45:05.699 align:start position:0%
and that's what parents would go to you
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
know this Agency for and say I we need
 
01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:09.350 align:start position:0%
know this Agency for and say I we need
help

01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:45:11.149 --> 01:45:11.159 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
01:45:13.250 --> 01:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
yeah but when you talk about school can
 
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
you use an adjective of the public
 
01:45:16.729 --> 01:45:16.739 align:start position:0%
school they're going to or the
 
01:45:18.169 --> 01:45:18.179 align:start position:0%
residential school when you say when
 
01:45:20.209 --> 01:45:20.219 align:start position:0%
they leave the school which school is at
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
the public school and they go home and
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
that's the problem or when they leave
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
the residential schools the problem
 
01:45:26.689 --> 01:45:26.699 align:start position:0%
before they're placed right they're in
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
public school and they're having trouble
 
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
at home
 
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
parents go to the agency and ask for
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
help and it could it could start with
 
01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
fast forward
 
01:45:37.129 --> 01:45:37.139 align:start position:0%
and some other things that occur but
 
01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
um then a child is placed residentially
 
01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
far away you know in many cases so then
 
01:45:44.330 --> 01:45:44.340 align:start position:0%
they're in school wherever they're
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
placed so the cost of that schooling
 
01:45:48.530 --> 01:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
then goes to the Lea
 
01:45:50.450 --> 01:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
so Doug is one other thing thank you so
 
01:45:52.609 --> 01:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
much for your forbearance here
 
01:45:52.619 --> 01:45:53.390 align:start position:0%
much for your forbearance here
um

01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
episode of treatment
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
could be and I'm going to exaggerate it
 
01:45:59.930 --> 01:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
could be that they go to this
 
01:46:01.370 --> 01:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
residential school for the next five
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
years it could be they sit down at the
 
01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
public school with a counselor
 
01:46:08.930 --> 01:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
um how many what what is an episode of
 
01:46:11.209 --> 01:46:11.219 align:start position:0%
treatment unit
 
01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
you would think that it's not a unit
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
it's just so what happens in the school
 
01:46:17.629 --> 01:46:17.639 align:start position:0%
is separate from this right
 
01:46:20.270 --> 01:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
so the kids this is
 
01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
so what's happened if a child's in the
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
public schools and they're in crisis
 
01:46:26.570 --> 01:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
right and we have counselors and they're
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
so we're doing that already
 
01:46:30.410 --> 01:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
so then
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
um fast forward is an agency I think
 
01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
that's part of this cat assessment
 
01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
behavioral organ uh Bureau that would go
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
in and try to provide therapy or
 
01:46:41.930 --> 01:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
guidance to the family if that doesn't
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
work they'll then do the cat assessment
 
01:46:46.250 --> 01:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
and be placed somewhere else sometimes
 
01:46:47.629 --> 01:46:47.639 align:start position:0%
do they go directly to the cat
 
01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
assessment and get so the challenge is
 
01:46:52.550 --> 01:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
just with the lack of structure as to
 
01:46:55.370 --> 01:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
who's funding this
 
01:46:57.950 --> 01:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
but my question will is
 
01:47:00.169 --> 01:47:00.179 align:start position:0%
at what point is it a health issue and
 
01:47:01.970 --> 01:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
not an education issue
 
01:47:03.890 --> 01:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
that's the question
 
01:47:05.930 --> 01:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
um and it health meaning mental health
 
01:47:08.090 --> 01:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
meaning behavioral health physical
 
01:47:11.450 --> 01:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
health all of the above and in in many
 
01:47:14.330 --> 01:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
times it's not an educational issue but
 
01:47:15.729 --> 01:47:15.739 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:47:18.649 --> 01:47:18.659 align:start position:0%
there's no you know way to fund it I
 
01:47:20.450 --> 01:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
think maybe on some occasions the state
 
01:47:22.850 --> 01:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
picks up the full cost but I'm
 
01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
I would imagine if so if a child doesn't
 
01:47:27.890 --> 01:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
have an IEP there's no cost to the Lea
 
01:47:31.010 --> 01:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
it's just for students with IEPs
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
okay Mary I am very troubled by the fact
 
01:47:36.649 --> 01:47:36.659 align:start position:0%
that the school district the Lea is not
 
01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
involved at all which
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
I don't I I just I don't understand how
 
01:47:44.990 --> 01:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
that can happen
 
01:47:46.609 --> 01:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
um I understand
 
01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:52.370 --> 01:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
um definitions you have children that
 
01:47:55.330 --> 01:47:55.340 align:start position:0%
who are on an IEP and you have children
 
01:47:58.850 --> 01:47:58.860 align:start position:0%
non-ie-p and the payment process is
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:05.590 --> 01:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
and for those children who are are
 
01:48:08.209 --> 01:48:08.219 align:start position:0%
served by an IEP
 
01:48:11.689 --> 01:48:11.699 align:start position:0%
who have been put in the situation
 
01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
by helping Human Services there's no
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
coordination with the school district
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
but the school district has to pay
 
01:48:25.850 --> 01:48:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:27.410 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:48:27.410 --> 01:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:48:31.490 --> 01:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it um basically
 
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
as the discussion shows this is a
 
01:48:36.590 --> 01:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
complicated topic right there are kids
 
01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
in trouble there are a lot of agencies
 
01:48:40.609 --> 01:48:40.619 align:start position:0%
that get involved I actually appreciate
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of the questions from the
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee because they helped you know
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
provide more background on exactly how
 
01:48:48.290 --> 01:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
this works but at the end of the day
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
what this law is trying to address is
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
that when all this process works through
 
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
and the conclusion is Rich that you know
 
01:48:56.330 --> 01:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
in the best of interest of the child
 
01:48:58.129 --> 01:48:58.139 align:start position:0%
that child has to be placed through this
 
01:49:00.410 --> 01:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
program and you've heard the safeguards
 
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
and the steps involved and whatnot
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
there is there are certain costs for the
 
01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:10.679 align:start position:0%
you know education of the child that you
 
01:49:13.129 --> 01:49:13.139 align:start position:0%
know are not no longer covered under
 
01:49:14.930 --> 01:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
that program and they fall to the local
 
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
school district and this is this law is
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
trying to make clear that you know in
 
01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
that case the state should pick up that
 
01:49:25.850 --> 01:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
particular burden because this is a
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
program that's really controlled by the
 
01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
state and designed to serve the best
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
interests of the child but exactly as
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative has what Heath was saying
 
01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
the school district cannot really
 
01:49:39.169 --> 01:49:39.179 align:start position:0%
control the outcome of this it's not
 
01:49:41.930 --> 01:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
really appropriate to you know have them
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
pay that
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
tuition associated with it that they
 
01:49:47.930 --> 01:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
don't you know have a control I mean
 
01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
it's hard enough the way we have the
 
01:49:52.129 --> 01:49:52.139 align:start position:0%
special education laws that really limit
 
01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
the ability of the school districts to
 
01:49:57.050 --> 01:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
worry about because but this one is
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
further out than that because they don't
 
01:50:01.609 --> 01:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
really control that process so it's an
 
01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
attempt to match again the decision
 
01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
making and the you know with the funding
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:14.810 --> 01:50:14.820 align:start position:0%
your bill but you have been fabulous I
 
01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
have to say and it's so wonderful to see
 
01:50:18.530 --> 01:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
you after all these years
 
01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:20.330 align:start position:0%
you after all these years
um

01:50:20.330 --> 01:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:20.340 --> 01:50:21.770 align:start position:0%
um
this

01:50:21.770 --> 01:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
just the whole process
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
flies in the face of idea
 
01:50:26.639 --> 01:50:28.129 align:start position:0%
flies in the face of idea
I'm

01:50:28.129 --> 01:50:28.139 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
is this New Hampshire specific
 
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:35.639 align:start position:0%
I I so New Hampshire is very unique
 
01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
in so many different ways if a child is
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
placed by the courts the only the only
 
01:50:44.090 --> 01:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
children in the schools need to fund the
 
01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
education portion for our children with
 
01:50:47.810 --> 01:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
disabilities so if a child without a
 
01:50:50.689 --> 01:50:50.699 align:start position:0%
disability is placed in
 
01:50:50.699 --> 01:50:51.530 align:start position:0%
disability is placed in
um

01:50:51.530 --> 01:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh let's say our I'm trying to think of
 
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
a residential facility uh in a
 
01:50:58.010 --> 01:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
residential facility if they have an IEP
 
01:50:59.930 --> 01:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
the Lea is responsible for funding and
 
01:51:03.410 --> 01:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
if they don't the state funds it
 
01:51:06.410 --> 01:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
and we go ahead we just have no fiscal
 
01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
note we have absolutely no idea of what
 
01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:10.490 align:start position:0%
note we have absolutely no idea of what
we're

01:51:10.490 --> 01:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:12.229 align:start position:0%
we're
um

01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:14.330 --> 01:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
saying that we need to budget for Once
 
01:51:16.250 --> 01:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
Upon a Time with court order placements
 
01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
I remember when I was at the department
 
01:51:20.330 --> 01:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
the line was empty because we just knew
 
01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
we had to pay it right
 
01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:23.820 align:start position:0%
that's what I feel like we're going to
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
be doing here is it going to be a line
 
01:51:29.629 --> 01:51:29.639 align:start position:0%
and we have a question mark in it and
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
how do we put a number in it that that
 
01:51:34.129 --> 01:51:34.139 align:start position:0%
is what I'm worried about plus the
 
01:51:36.290 --> 01:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
process all around
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
and I want to say it's desperately
 
01:51:40.609 --> 01:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
needed um I agree my preference would be
 
01:51:42.590 --> 01:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a third party that has some
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
formula for this but
 
01:51:46.490 --> 01:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
um it's desperately needed and I just it
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some you know
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
structure to it I think so this would
 
01:51:54.410 --> 01:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
provide respite for the school districts
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:51:58.370 --> 01:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
is respite for the school districts oh
 
01:52:00.050 --> 01:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
no what do you what do you mean I mean
 
01:52:01.490 --> 01:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
in terms of money
 
01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
came in oh yeah yeah we would be yes yes
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
correct all right thank you
 
01:52:09.609 --> 01:52:09.619 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if I may
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you I am equally
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
concerned by the fact that we don't have
 
01:52:17.149 --> 01:52:17.159 align:start position:0%
an estimate and on one hand I can
 
01:52:18.770 --> 01:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
understand why because of the
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
complexities of this it was hard to get
 
01:52:22.490 --> 01:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
an estimate you know at the time when
 
01:52:24.770 --> 01:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
the bill was designed and whatnot but I
 
01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
completely agree that we do need to work
 
01:52:28.850 --> 01:52:28.860 align:start position:0%
with the doe and see for in the HHS and
 
01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
everybody involved in just try to at
 
01:52:32.930 --> 01:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
least get a forecast based on the
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
current practices there should be some
 
01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
data somewhere that maybe wasn't yet
 
01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
made available but we do need to hear
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
because we will need to basically set
 
01:52:44.930 --> 01:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
aside of a reserve for this we may not
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
be able to know the exact dollars but we
 
01:52:48.649 --> 01:52:48.659 align:start position:0%
do need to have an understanding of the
 
01:52:51.770 --> 01:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
ballpark and decide whether we will fund
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
it you know the way it is or will cap it
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
and figure it you know there has to be a
 
01:52:59.629 --> 01:52:59.639 align:start position:0%
way to estimate that before we
 
01:53:01.850 --> 01:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
finalize the budget I mean obviously you
 
01:53:03.590 --> 01:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
cannot write a blank check and this is
 
01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
not the intent of this
 
01:53:08.930 --> 01:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
who just as more of a point of Interest
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
Who makes the decision
 
01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
that the student's going to go to a
 
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
residence is that a DHHS decision or is
 
01:53:18.050 --> 01:53:18.060 align:start position:0%
it my understanding is it's the third
 
01:53:20.090 --> 01:53:20.100 align:start position:0%
party vendor
 
01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
huh

01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:30.109 --> 01:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
and the parent chooses whether or not
 
01:53:33.890 --> 01:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
it's a parent choice okay just just to
 
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
clarify while the decision may be made
 
01:53:38.209 --> 01:53:38.219 align:start position:0%
by the vendor the vendor is acting on
 
01:53:40.970 --> 01:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
behalf of the state government so you
 
01:53:42.649 --> 01:53:42.659 align:start position:0%
know whether it's the agency directory
 
01:53:44.689 --> 01:53:44.699 align:start position:0%
or a subcontract that they retain for
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
the program at the end of the day the
 
01:53:48.109 --> 01:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
control is with the state agency that
 
01:53:50.450 --> 01:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
runs the program they may not make the
 
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
day by day decisions but they do control
 
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
the policy and the implementation we're
 
01:53:58.430 --> 01:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:59.689 --> 01:53:59.699 align:start position:0%
that it's a you know
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
and there really is is running the show
 
01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
on this so
 
01:54:06.250 --> 01:54:06.260 align:start position:0%
um but and but they're paid by DHHS
 
01:54:08.689 --> 01:54:08.699 align:start position:0%
correct so it's a third party vendor and
 
01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:11.580 align:start position:0%
whether or not DHHS you know has the
 
01:54:13.250 --> 01:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
final say I would say they probably do
 
01:54:16.250 --> 01:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
have some influence and step in
 
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair would it be useful to
 
01:54:22.729 --> 01:54:22.739 align:start position:0%
hear from DHS on this or from division
 
01:54:22.739 --> 01:54:24.290 align:start position:0%
hear from DHS on this or from division
three

01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
in terms I mean this is complicated this
 
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
goes across so many different areas I'm
 
01:54:31.250 --> 01:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
still struggling spending money on this
 
01:54:32.209 --> 01:54:32.219 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming uh through this third party
 
01:54:37.250 --> 01:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
vendor yeah we're paying about 75 000
 
01:54:38.330 --> 01:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
per child
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
in the district right correct
 
01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:43.550 align:start position:0%
in the district right correct
so

01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
but the the vendor and I I think I think
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps maybe parents who are Medicaid
 
01:54:51.649 --> 01:54:51.659 align:start position:0%
eligible I don't know I don't know how
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's funded through
 
01:54:54.830 --> 01:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
the state well that was the next
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
question if this is a health issue then
 
01:54:59.390 --> 01:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
either Medicaid or a family health plan
 
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
or something sense to me like should be
 
01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
the funding source or not the state uh
 
01:55:05.930 --> 01:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
or am I all wet here
 
01:55:09.609 --> 01:55:09.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:13.370 --> 01:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
I mean I've been at this a long time
 
01:55:15.229 --> 01:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
um there was a time when we had a
 
01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:17.820 align:start position:0%
facility with seven psychiatrists right
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
there's there's nothing anymore so it's
 
01:55:22.129 --> 01:55:22.139 align:start position:0%
very very hard
 
01:55:22.139 --> 01:55:22.970 align:start position:0%
very very hard
um

01:55:22.970 --> 01:55:22.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:25.490 --> 01:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
so to find solutions for the kids and
 
01:55:27.410 --> 01:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
and to figure out you know how to manage
 
01:55:30.350 --> 01:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
all of the complexities of all of this
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
um I think the intentions were very good
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
on on everybody's part
 
01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:36.470 align:start position:0%
on on everybody's part
um

01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:39.950 --> 01:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
okay so you have any ideas of how we
 
01:55:43.790 --> 01:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
might go about finding out
 
01:55:48.350 --> 01:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
skinny data so we did get late very late
 
01:55:49.850 --> 01:55:49.860 align:start position:0%
in the game from the Department of
 
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
Education some essentially an
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
indeterminable type fiscal note because
 
01:55:56.030 --> 01:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
it is hard to predict this they did
 
01:56:00.050 --> 01:56:00.060 align:start position:0%
report that HHS in 2122 school year had
 
01:56:04.129 --> 01:56:04.139 align:start position:0%
50 students or 50 young folks that would
 
01:56:05.689 --> 01:56:05.699 align:start position:0%
apply that this would have applied for
 
01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
as far as what the costs are and any
 
01:56:08.159 --> 01:56:09.050 align:start position:0%
as far as what the costs are and any
state

01:56:09.050 --> 01:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
funds that were distributed on behalf of
 
01:56:13.609 --> 01:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
those students I don't know we didn't
 
01:56:15.770 --> 01:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
get any information from DHHS on this
 
01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:16.490 align:start position:0%
get any information from DHHS on this
bill

01:56:16.490 --> 01:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:56:19.010 --> 01:56:19.020 align:start position:0%
and I was hoping we'd have perhaps some
 
01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
agency folks here today and we don't so
 
01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:23.639 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you want to
 
01:56:27.709 --> 01:56:27.719 align:start position:0%
recess this work session or if you uh
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know treat it like your other bills
 
01:56:30.649 --> 01:56:30.659 align:start position:0%
and retain it and have it be part of a
 
01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
host Bill one house bill two court
 
01:56:34.490 --> 01:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
ordered placements of course is in the
 
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
budget there's four and a half million
 
01:56:37.609 --> 01:56:37.619 align:start position:0%
dollars carried as a budget line item
 
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
there also is an open warrant like there
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
has been for years for that program so
 
01:56:43.250 --> 01:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
whatever the liability is for the state
 
01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
it is it is covered the department of Ed
 
01:56:47.870 --> 01:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
can go to the Comptroller and get funds
 
01:56:49.490 --> 01:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
and this would just include those
 
01:56:51.290 --> 01:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
episode of treatments in that line item
 
01:56:53.689 --> 01:56:53.699 align:start position:0%
so the state would would pay whatever it
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
is I just don't know if anyone has an
 
01:56:57.770 --> 01:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
estimate for the next two years well
 
01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to be approving
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
invoices from the vendor I mean there's
 
01:57:02.810 --> 01:57:02.820 align:start position:0%
there's got to be somebody somewhere
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
that knows something
 
01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
so yeah well my question then Mickey is
 
01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
can we say that that students in this
 
01:57:17.209 --> 01:57:17.219 align:start position:0%
category would fall into court ordered
 
01:57:21.290 --> 01:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
placements and the payment would be
 
01:57:23.209 --> 01:57:23.219 align:start position:0%
come out of that line
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
and we'd have to increase it accordingly
 
01:57:30.109 --> 01:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how many students or
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
01:57:34.970 --> 01:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
some of the there may be some overlap I
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
think I don't I don't really know the
 
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
specifics of this but whatever that line
 
01:57:39.649 --> 01:57:39.659 align:start position:0%
item is for quarter Replacements is that
 
01:57:42.850 --> 01:57:42.860 align:start position:0%
what you're asking like well this it has
 
01:57:46.010 --> 01:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
comparable attributes except the court
 
01:57:48.410 --> 01:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
ordered is court ordered and this is
 
01:57:51.890 --> 01:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
apparently HHS accorded right um and
 
01:57:53.870 --> 01:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
quite frankly this bill was
 
01:57:57.530 --> 01:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly supported by many and as
 
01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
as a parent and as a administrator I
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
would love this bill
 
01:58:05.209 --> 01:58:05.219 align:start position:0%
um because it does a lot of things I
 
01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
just am trying to figure out where to
 
01:58:10.129 --> 01:58:10.139 align:start position:0%
put it how to fund it
 
01:58:12.770 --> 01:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
um and get the help that people need
 
01:58:14.570 --> 01:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like we really need to
 
01:58:18.290 --> 01:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
do this and it's a I think greatly a
 
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
mental health issue oh it is it is yeah
 
01:58:24.649 --> 01:58:24.659 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion would be to you know
 
01:58:25.970 --> 01:58:25.980 align:start position:0%
pretty much continue the current
 
01:58:27.830 --> 01:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
practice I mean the intent of this bill
 
01:58:29.930 --> 01:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
is to essentially just add placement for
 
01:58:31.669 --> 01:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
an episode of treatment to the statute
 
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
that already handles the out you know
 
01:58:35.689 --> 01:58:35.699 align:start position:0%
the court ordered stuff so they would be
 
01:58:37.070 --> 01:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
falling under the same rules same
 
01:58:39.530 --> 01:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
everything but we do definitely need to
 
01:58:41.570 --> 01:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
consider the financial impact because we
 
01:58:42.530 --> 01:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
cannot just
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
squeeze everybody in and keep that
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
budget line the same we do have to get
 
01:58:48.350 --> 01:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
those numbers from wherever they are and
 
01:58:50.810 --> 01:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
figure out what the forecast is because
 
01:58:53.209 --> 01:58:53.219 align:start position:0%
we should Reserve those funds open
 
01:58:55.310 --> 01:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
warrants are all nice and good but it is
 
01:58:57.050 --> 01:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
not okay to just say well we'll worry
 
01:58:58.910 --> 01:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
about the cost when we get there we we
 
01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
do need to make a best effort get as
 
01:59:03.890 --> 01:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
good information as we can on what is
 
01:59:06.290 --> 01:59:06.300 align:start position:0%
the expected cost understanding that you
 
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
know there is
 
01:59:09.530 --> 01:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
it's hard to forecast correctly but we
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
do need to adjust that line item
 
01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:13.189 align:start position:0%
do need to adjust that line item
accordingly

01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
an option would be to recess the work
 
01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
session and I can try to follow up with
 
01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
you know the department of Ed and the
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:59:22.430 --> 01:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
to see you do that to see if anyone can
 
01:59:24.410 --> 01:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
give us a ballpark estimate I know it's
 
01:59:26.930 --> 01:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
probably a difficult one to predict and
 
01:59:27.950 --> 01:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
then at least you'll have some
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
information to proceed but uh but my
 
01:59:31.970 --> 01:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
point is I don't know if it's going to
 
01:59:34.129 --> 01:59:34.139 align:start position:0%
be that hard because we're doing it
 
01:59:36.290 --> 01:59:36.300 align:start position:0%
we're already doing this
 
01:59:38.089 --> 01:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
I think we're in year three in a
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
different form
 
01:59:42.109 --> 01:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh and all this is doing is they do this
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
you're keep doing what you're doing so
 
01:59:47.570 --> 01:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
somebody's paying that that's up that
 
01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:48.770 align:start position:0%
somebody's paying that that's up that
subcontractor

01:59:48.770 --> 01:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
subcontractor
 
01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
and and the state somebody has to pay
 
01:59:52.189 --> 01:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
the other portion
 
01:59:53.930 --> 01:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
we're paying for the School portion for
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:57.360 --> 01:59:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:00:01.430 --> 02:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
trying to research where it says an
 
02:00:06.050 --> 02:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
episode is defined in RSA 193 colon 27
 
02:00:10.129 --> 02:00:10.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:11.890 --> 02:00:11.900 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:00:19.250 --> 02:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:21.070 --> 02:00:21.080 align:start position:0%
it's inserted
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
oh I looked it up too because I forgot
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
it was defined here it's an addition to
 
02:00:27.410 --> 02:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
the definition so it's the definition is
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:33.709 --> 02:00:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:36.410 --> 02:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
well let's recess and see if we can give
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
them a little more information but to me
 
02:00:40.609 --> 02:00:40.619 align:start position:0%
all this all this is caught doing is
 
02:00:42.430 --> 02:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
codifying what we're already doing
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
it's just changing the funding yes yeah
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
well it's in the statute
 
02:00:50.689 --> 02:00:50.699 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you very much for
 
02:00:52.850 --> 02:00:52.860 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you I'm probably
 
02:00:55.070 --> 02:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
going to go to one o'clock for the 5 27
 
02:00:56.990 --> 02:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
over in threes but I'll be back after
 
02:00:59.450 --> 02:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
that okay so let's take lunch until one
 
02:01:17.209 --> 02:01:17.219 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:25.610 --> 03:01:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:27.230 --> 03:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health and Human
 
03:01:29.090 --> 03:01:29.100 align:start position:0%
Services here who I think could maybe
 
03:01:31.250 --> 03:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
shed a little bit of late and answer
 
03:01:33.230 --> 03:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
some questions on House Bill 521 where
 
03:01:44.650 --> 03:01:44.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:47.570 --> 03:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
mine don't either well I'll get a hand
 
03:01:50.690 --> 03:01:50.700 align:start position:0%
wrist slap good afternoon Mr chair
 
03:01:52.010 --> 03:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:01:54.050 --> 03:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
my name is Rebecca Ross I'm the director
 
03:01:55.969 --> 03:01:55.979 align:start position:0%
of The Bureau for children's Behavioral
 
03:01:57.650 --> 03:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
Health at the Department of Health and
 
03:01:59.929 --> 03:01:59.939 align:start position:0%
Human Services and I am happy to help
 
03:02:01.490 --> 03:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
answer any questions or provide
 
03:02:03.830 --> 03:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
explanation well we have a we have a
 
03:02:07.490 --> 03:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
bill before us that expands uh
 
03:02:09.650 --> 03:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
03:02:12.830 --> 03:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
and talks about episodes
 
03:02:15.530 --> 03:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
and we had some testimony this morning
 
03:02:16.929 --> 03:02:16.939 align:start position:0%
that said
 
03:02:19.910 --> 03:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
students that are subject to this
 
03:02:19.920 --> 03:02:23.809 align:start position:0%
students that are subject to this
uh

03:02:23.809 --> 03:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:25.190 --> 03:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out what the right
 
03:02:27.349 --> 03:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
words are we don't know who pays for it
 
03:02:29.269 --> 03:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
okay and we don't know how many there
 
03:02:31.730 --> 03:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
are we're not objecting to paying for it
 
03:02:33.290 --> 03:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
but we're going to get our arms around
 
03:02:36.230 --> 03:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
how many students are and I can't
 
03:02:38.450 --> 03:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
remember the company cat was it yeah cat
 
03:02:41.330 --> 03:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
was the evaluator
 
03:02:45.830 --> 03:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
I am happy to give you the background on
 
03:02:47.389 --> 03:02:47.399 align:start position:0%
the transformation of residential
 
03:02:49.370 --> 03:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
treatment in New Hampshire I will try to
 
03:02:52.250 --> 03:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
give it at the highest level but can
 
03:02:53.929 --> 03:02:53.939 align:start position:0%
provide more detail if that'll be
 
03:02:58.849 --> 03:02:58.859 align:start position:0%
helpful so consistent with RSA 135 F and
 
03:03:00.290 --> 03:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
the system of care for children's
 
03:03:01.849 --> 03:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health
 
03:03:06.230 --> 03:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
we shifted Residential Treatment from a
 
03:03:08.809 --> 03:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
dcyf or division for children youth and
 
03:03:11.269 --> 03:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
families child protection and Juvenile
 
03:03:15.230 --> 03:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
Justice only service to a department
 
03:03:18.590 --> 03:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
service so that any child who is in need
 
03:03:20.510 --> 03:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
of behavioral health treatment at a
 
03:03:23.630 --> 03:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
residential level can access that
 
03:03:25.070 --> 03:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
treatment without having to be court
 
03:03:28.250 --> 03:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
involved so this is to serve kids when
 
03:03:30.530 --> 03:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
they need it where they need it without
 
03:03:32.929 --> 03:03:32.939 align:start position:0%
a punitive Court involvement until or
 
03:03:36.110 --> 03:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
unless that's necessary prior to that
 
03:03:38.990 --> 03:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
there was no access so that's that's the
 
03:03:43.130 --> 03:03:43.140 align:start position:0%
shift previously under 126 I believe
 
03:03:45.590 --> 03:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's 126 U
 
03:03:49.370 --> 03:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
um the there was an exception or a
 
03:03:50.990 --> 03:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
change in the way
 
03:03:54.050 --> 03:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
education was paid for children in
 
03:03:57.410 --> 03:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
residential with IEPs if they were dcyf
 
03:03:59.269 --> 03:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
or court involved but because we're
 
03:04:03.070 --> 03:04:03.080 align:start position:0%
removing that step the law left a gap
 
03:04:06.230 --> 03:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
for payment for kids who are going
 
03:04:08.090 --> 03:04:08.100 align:start position:0%
directly to that same type of
 
03:04:09.830 --> 03:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
residential service for the same type of
 
03:04:11.389 --> 03:04:11.399 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health need
 
03:04:13.969 --> 03:04:13.979 align:start position:0%
but their families not court involved so
 
03:04:16.790 --> 03:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
this is an attempt to close that Gap if
 
03:04:19.849 --> 03:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
I may uh Mr chairman uh when when did
 
03:04:22.490 --> 03:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
that change take effect
 
03:04:25.190 --> 03:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
approximately two
 
03:04:26.570 --> 03:04:26.580 align:start position:0%
you know we started serving kids
 
03:04:29.090 --> 03:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
directly when we really received this
 
03:04:32.570 --> 03:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
funding from SB 14 which was the the
 
03:04:34.550 --> 03:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
biggest modification to that system of
 
03:04:36.110 --> 03:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
care it was originally established in
 
03:04:38.330 --> 03:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
2016 but the residential component came
 
03:04:40.969 --> 03:04:40.979 align:start position:0%
in with that budget and then essentially
 
03:04:42.530 --> 03:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
rolled out at the beginning of the
 
03:04:45.410 --> 03:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
current biennium and a student do they
 
03:04:47.870 --> 03:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
have to have an IEP to qualify
 
03:04:52.250 --> 03:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
no so there are about 25 of the youth
 
03:04:54.410 --> 03:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
that we are serving directly in
 
03:04:57.410 --> 03:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
residential do not have IEPs now they
 
03:04:59.090 --> 03:04:59.100 align:start position:0%
may be in the process of being evaluated
 
03:05:02.690 --> 03:05:02.700 align:start position:0%
for one ultimately they may have one but
 
03:05:04.370 --> 03:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
currently upon admission or upon
 
03:05:05.809 --> 03:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
requests for admission they don't have
 
03:05:07.990 --> 03:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
them so we're talking about 75 percent
 
03:05:11.570 --> 03:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
of the non-dcyf youth
 
03:05:13.910 --> 03:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
Mary so let me see if I have this
 
03:05:16.730 --> 03:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
straight so we have two populations of
 
03:05:16.740 --> 03:05:17.630 align:start position:0%
straight so we have two populations of
children

03:05:17.630 --> 03:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:05:20.269 --> 03:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
being served by this process
 
03:05:23.809 --> 03:05:23.819 align:start position:0%
so we have children who are not they do
 
03:05:25.670 --> 03:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
not have an IEP
 
03:05:29.510 --> 03:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
and for those children they are placed
 
03:05:31.450 --> 03:05:31.460 align:start position:0%
after they go through this evaluation
 
03:05:34.490 --> 03:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
and the state pays for them
 
03:05:39.410 --> 03:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:41.530 --> 03:05:41.540 align:start position:0%
and are placed
 
03:05:45.230 --> 03:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
those children their services are
 
03:05:49.010 --> 03:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
charged to the Lea
 
03:05:49.020 --> 03:05:50.530 align:start position:0%
charged to the Lea
no

03:05:50.530 --> 03:05:50.540 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:05:54.290 --> 03:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
only if they are dcyf involved So
 
03:05:56.870 --> 03:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
currently well that's what I meant for
 
03:05:58.849 --> 03:05:58.859 align:start position:0%
those children going the same process
 
03:06:01.730 --> 03:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
but two different populations so that
 
03:06:05.510 --> 03:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
children who are not iepied
 
03:06:07.910 --> 03:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
children who do not have an individual
 
03:06:09.290 --> 03:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
education plan
 
03:06:11.450 --> 03:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
the state pays for them
 
03:06:13.370 --> 03:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
through defense once they go through the
 
03:06:14.570 --> 03:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
evaluation they're part of the
 
03:06:14.580 --> 03:06:15.710 align:start position:0%
evaluation they're part of the
behavioral

03:06:15.710 --> 03:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
behavioral
 
03:06:19.790 --> 03:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:21.530 --> 03:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
um so I think there's there's two
 
03:06:22.730 --> 03:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
different layers or two different
 
03:06:25.849 --> 03:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
categories first there's are they
 
03:06:28.070 --> 03:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
involved with dcyf or division for
 
03:06:30.349 --> 03:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
children youth and families yes or no if
 
03:06:32.570 --> 03:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
the answer is no then the behavioral
 
03:06:34.910 --> 03:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
health system steps in and then the
 
03:06:36.650 --> 03:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
behavioral health system has to decide
 
03:06:40.670 --> 03:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
do they have an IEP yes or no currently
 
03:06:44.690 --> 03:06:44.700 align:start position:0%
unless the school changes the IEP to
 
03:06:47.389 --> 03:06:47.399 align:start position:0%
include that residential treatment
 
03:06:49.070 --> 03:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
Bureau of children's Behavioral Health
 
03:06:51.050 --> 03:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
is paying for the education for both
 
03:06:54.230 --> 03:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
kids with IEPs and without IEPs this
 
03:06:56.450 --> 03:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
bill would address the population with
 
03:06:58.610 --> 03:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
IEPs we will still be paying for
 
03:07:01.370 --> 03:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
education for those without IEPs
 
03:07:01.380 --> 03:07:02.690 align:start position:0%
education for those without IEPs
okay

03:07:02.690 --> 03:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:07:02.700 --> 03:07:05.030 align:start position:0%
okay
so

03:07:05.030 --> 03:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:07.610 --> 03:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
what I think we're considering
 
03:07:10.309 --> 03:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm speaking for I think
 
03:07:12.590 --> 03:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
we have district court ordered
 
03:07:15.110 --> 03:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
placements yes so we would add an
 
03:07:15.120 --> 03:07:16.849 align:start position:0%
placements yes so we would add an
element

03:07:16.849 --> 03:07:16.859 align:start position:0%
element
 
03:07:20.090 --> 03:07:20.100 align:start position:0%
for this population of children to that
 
03:07:20.100 --> 03:07:20.809 align:start position:0%
for this population of children to that
line

03:07:20.809 --> 03:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:07:23.230 --> 03:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
yes and this would be additional funds
 
03:07:26.809 --> 03:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
that would go to the school district I
 
03:07:26.819 --> 03:07:28.070 align:start position:0%
that would go to the school district I
understand

03:07:28.070 --> 03:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
understand
 
03:07:32.210 --> 03:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
for children who have IEPs and are
 
03:07:34.429 --> 03:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
placed by you
 
03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
so I am not the expert on the
 
03:07:39.769 --> 03:07:39.779 align:start position:0%
Educational Funding piece except to say
 
03:07:42.530 --> 03:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
right now I'm paying for the majority of
 
03:07:46.670 --> 03:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
it out of DHHS funding but this is where
 
03:07:49.429 --> 03:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
there's there's a cap so as soon as they
 
03:07:53.269 --> 03:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
exceed a certain amount it kicks to doe
 
03:07:55.790 --> 03:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
as far as the Appropriations or any
 
03:07:55.800 --> 03:07:57.110 align:start position:0%
as far as the Appropriations or any
change

03:07:57.110 --> 03:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
change
 
03:07:58.910 --> 03:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not the person to answer that
 
03:07:58.920 --> 03:08:00.790 align:start position:0%
I'm not the person to answer that
question

03:08:00.790 --> 03:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:08:05.450 --> 03:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
if I may go ahead yeah thank you uh Mr
 
03:08:05.460 --> 03:08:06.650 align:start position:0%
if I may go ahead yeah thank you uh Mr
chair

03:08:06.650 --> 03:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:08:08.929 --> 03:08:08.939 align:start position:0%
um how many kids involved in each
 
03:08:11.090 --> 03:08:11.100 align:start position:0%
category do if you know
 
03:08:15.550 --> 03:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
sure so today there are less than
 
03:08:21.410 --> 03:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
350 youth total in residential placement
 
03:08:24.950 --> 03:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
through DHHS there are other youth who
 
03:08:27.370 --> 03:08:27.380 align:start position:0%
are in educational placements through
 
03:08:29.690 --> 03:08:29.700 align:start position:0%
school and we're not talking about those
 
03:08:32.510 --> 03:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
so exclusively through DHHS there are
 
03:08:36.530 --> 03:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
less than 350 of those between 60 to 70
 
03:08:40.309 --> 03:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
are not involved with dcyf the remainder
 
03:08:43.910 --> 03:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
are the expectation is that over the
 
03:08:46.309 --> 03:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
coming years more and more will shift to
 
03:08:49.010 --> 03:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
the voluntary system because it's
 
03:08:52.510 --> 03:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
available and can be accessed earlier
 
03:08:56.690 --> 03:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
than the Intensive court process so
 
03:08:58.370 --> 03:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
while we don't expect to see an increase
 
03:09:00.050 --> 03:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
in the overall number in residential
 
03:09:02.269 --> 03:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
more will be served directly through the
 
03:09:04.309 --> 03:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
voluntary system and less will be
 
03:09:07.070 --> 03:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
through the dcyf system yeah
 
03:09:11.330 --> 03:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to um clarify that on page
 
03:09:14.750 --> 03:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
three line is two to five
 
03:09:17.269 --> 03:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
that clearly defines what will be paid
 
03:09:20.090 --> 03:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
for it specifically says any course of
 
03:09:21.830 --> 03:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
special education or special education
 
03:09:24.410 --> 03:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
and related Services related to an
 
03:09:26.090 --> 03:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
episode of treatment and the termination
 
03:09:28.429 --> 03:09:28.439 align:start position:0%
of placement by the DHHS shall be
 
03:09:29.990 --> 03:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
covered in full for students with
 
03:09:32.510 --> 03:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities by Doe that's that's
 
03:09:34.670 --> 03:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
exactly the population that is being
 
03:09:36.469 --> 03:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
addressed by this bill the rest of the
 
03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
bill just adds the necessary language to
 
03:09:40.849 --> 03:09:40.859 align:start position:0%
make sure that those services are
 
03:09:44.210 --> 03:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:46.910 --> 03:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
I just want to say thank you this
 
03:09:50.150 --> 03:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
for years we've heard testimony about
 
03:09:52.130 --> 03:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
children in crisis we've heard from
 
03:09:54.530 --> 03:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
parents who have been beside themselves
 
03:09:56.330 --> 03:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
they don't know what to do
 
03:09:58.910 --> 03:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
so from what I'm understanding parents
 
03:10:02.150 --> 03:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
can come to you in crisis and you will
 
03:10:03.230 --> 03:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
help them
 
03:10:04.910 --> 03:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
yes and we've opened up a number of
 
03:10:07.550 --> 03:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
Pathways including rapid response and
 
03:10:10.550 --> 03:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
the mobile teams that have changed how
 
03:10:13.070 --> 03:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
they get to us but absolutely that's
 
03:10:15.349 --> 03:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
exactly what we've done and the cat
 
03:10:16.910 --> 03:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
assessment that you heard about before
 
03:10:19.130 --> 03:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
is the comprehensive assessment for
 
03:10:19.140 --> 03:10:20.469 align:start position:0%
is the comprehensive assessment for
treatment

03:10:20.469 --> 03:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
03:10:22.910 --> 03:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
which determines what level of
 
03:10:25.790 --> 03:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment they need and if
 
03:10:27.290 --> 03:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
they are clinically eligible for
 
03:10:28.790 --> 03:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
residential treatment so we've
 
03:10:30.410 --> 03:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
contracted with Maximus a National
 
03:10:33.050 --> 03:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
Vendor who does an assessment using the
 
03:10:34.849 --> 03:10:34.859 align:start position:0%
Child and Adolescent needs and strengths
 
03:10:36.950 --> 03:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
tool as well as interviews and document
 
03:10:39.769 --> 03:10:39.779 align:start position:0%
review to determine
 
03:10:41.630 --> 03:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
um whether or not they're clinically
 
03:10:44.150 --> 03:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
eligible and at what level our treatment
 
03:10:46.190 --> 03:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
providers are now levels one through
 
03:10:47.990 --> 03:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
five including five which is the
 
03:10:49.250 --> 03:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
psychiatric residential treatment
 
03:10:51.469 --> 03:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
facility that we're looking to open up
 
03:10:54.769 --> 03:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
at Hampstead Hospital and so we have
 
03:10:56.750 --> 03:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
changed to a Contracting model with all
 
03:10:58.570 --> 03:10:58.580 align:start position:0%
of our Residential Treatment providers
 
03:11:00.769 --> 03:11:00.779 align:start position:0%
and for the first time we're starting to
 
03:11:03.290 --> 03:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
have data on the clinical needs the
 
03:11:03.300 --> 03:11:04.630 align:start position:0%
have data on the clinical needs the
strengths

03:11:04.630 --> 03:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
strengths
 
03:11:07.550 --> 03:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
and the levels of care that over time
 
03:11:10.010 --> 03:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
will be able to dial in much better how
 
03:11:11.450 --> 03:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
much and what type of residential
 
03:11:14.450 --> 03:11:14.460 align:start position:0%
treatment we need to minimize it and
 
03:11:16.730 --> 03:11:16.740 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on that so when the
 
03:11:19.250 --> 03:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
child leaves residential placement is
 
03:11:21.590 --> 03:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
there a transition plan for them yes so
 
03:11:23.710 --> 03:11:23.720 align:start position:0%
that's part of our through our intensive
 
03:11:25.790 --> 03:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
community-based programming in our Care
 
03:11:27.410 --> 03:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
Management entities also part of the
 
03:11:29.349 --> 03:11:29.359 align:start position:0%
system of care the transitional
 
03:11:32.349 --> 03:11:32.359 align:start position:0%
residential enhanced care coordination
 
03:11:35.269 --> 03:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
is available to everyone in residential
 
03:11:37.250 --> 03:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
through bcbh and that's where a care
 
03:11:38.990 --> 03:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
coordinator is working with the child
 
03:11:40.910 --> 03:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
and the family to put the pieces in
 
03:11:43.010 --> 03:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
place so that upon discharge all of
 
03:11:44.870 --> 03:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
those services and supports are in place
 
03:11:46.730 --> 03:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
when they return back to the school and
 
03:11:49.010 --> 03:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
Community finally just one related to
 
03:11:52.429 --> 03:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
the those individuals with EPS yes um
 
03:11:54.590 --> 03:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
you so there is a connection to the
 
03:11:56.990 --> 03:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
school district for that child to have
 
03:11:59.809 --> 03:11:59.819 align:start position:0%
that added to their plan
 
03:12:03.590 --> 03:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
so the school districts are responsible
 
03:12:06.349 --> 03:12:06.359 align:start position:0%
for their IEPs and we don't
 
03:12:08.929 --> 03:12:08.939 align:start position:0%
try to impose this what we try to do is
 
03:12:10.610 --> 03:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
have a partnership so that when the
 
03:12:13.190 --> 03:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
child is in residential we're meeting
 
03:12:16.210 --> 03:12:16.220 align:start position:0%
their individual family
 
03:12:19.309 --> 03:12:19.319 align:start position:0%
behavioral and educational needs and
 
03:12:21.170 --> 03:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
there's a plan in place to return to all
 
03:12:22.849 --> 03:12:22.859 align:start position:0%
of those as soon as it's clinically
 
03:12:24.830 --> 03:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate so we would include them in
 
03:12:26.389 --> 03:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
all thank you planning
 
03:12:27.950 --> 03:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
great you haven't asked a question yet
 
03:12:31.250 --> 03:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
oh you noticed thank you thank you
 
03:12:32.750 --> 03:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
because this is finally making some
 
03:12:35.570 --> 03:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
sense so just a couple things to clarify
 
03:12:38.809 --> 03:12:38.819 align:start position:0%
um I missed the the students that we're
 
03:12:41.450 --> 03:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
talking about they do have IEPs or they
 
03:12:44.510 --> 03:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
don't have IEPs for the purpose of this
 
03:12:46.969 --> 03:12:46.979 align:start position:0%
bill these are the students with IEPs
 
03:12:48.469 --> 03:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
the ones that do okay I thought that's
 
03:12:50.210 --> 03:12:50.220 align:start position:0%
what I really want to make for now we
 
03:12:51.950 --> 03:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
continue we will continue to pay the
 
03:12:54.769 --> 03:12:54.779 align:start position:0%
educational costs for the placements for
 
03:12:56.809 --> 03:12:56.819 align:start position:0%
other youth who are and without the IEPs
 
03:13:00.950 --> 03:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:03.710 --> 03:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
um so a mobile crisis unit I could say
 
03:13:05.809 --> 03:13:05.819 align:start position:0%
is it is it accurate to say that that's
 
03:13:08.690 --> 03:13:08.700 align:start position:0%
a tool in your kit yes and so this is
 
03:13:10.429 --> 03:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
going back to kids who are stuck in the
 
03:13:12.290 --> 03:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
hospital for a psychiatric reason and
 
03:13:13.490 --> 03:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
they're there for three months because
 
03:13:15.830 --> 03:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
there's no place so this is addressing
 
03:13:18.830 --> 03:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
that problem okay and right now I think
 
03:13:20.710 --> 03:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to figure out before
 
03:13:24.769 --> 03:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
DHHS is paying this and this would come
 
03:13:26.870 --> 03:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
to the education
 
03:13:29.389 --> 03:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
is there are we moving money from DHS
 
03:13:32.510 --> 03:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
who you're paying for it now yes so is
 
03:13:33.889 --> 03:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
this a change of where the money is
 
03:13:35.030 --> 03:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
going to come from that it's not coming
 
03:13:37.130 --> 03:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
from you anymore it would come from one
 
03:13:39.889 --> 03:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
of our division two or is it because if
 
03:13:41.090 --> 03:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be paying for it
 
03:13:41.100 --> 03:13:42.290 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be paying for it
anymore

03:13:42.290 --> 03:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
03:13:44.389 --> 03:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
we will where is it coming out of here
 
03:13:44.399 --> 03:13:45.950 align:start position:0%
we will where is it coming out of here
and

03:13:45.950 --> 03:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:48.050 --> 03:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
why so they're going to continue to pay
 
03:13:49.610 --> 03:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
for it
 
03:13:51.230 --> 03:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
so where is it coming out of our part of
 
03:13:52.610 --> 03:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
the budget why isn't it in division
 
03:13:55.190 --> 03:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
three I that's the question I asked her
 
03:13:57.469 --> 03:13:57.479 align:start position:0%
this morning uh why isn't this in the
 
03:14:00.050 --> 03:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
DHHS why isn't it why are we in division
 
03:14:02.750 --> 03:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
two I yeah if I may I cannot speak for
 
03:14:04.610 --> 03:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
leadership and who sends bills to what
 
03:14:05.990 --> 03:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee but this is a special
 
03:14:10.429 --> 03:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
education bill so while the control you
 
03:14:13.010 --> 03:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
know for the placement is through DHHS
 
03:14:14.450 --> 03:14:14.460 align:start position:0%
and you could argue you could go to
 
03:14:17.450 --> 03:14:17.460 align:start position:0%
division three this affects education
 
03:14:19.130 --> 03:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
funding in schools because it
 
03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
specifically talks about the fact that
 
03:14:24.170 --> 03:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
the the the Department of Education will
 
03:14:26.510 --> 03:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
now be responsible so I'm guessing
 
03:14:28.130 --> 03:14:28.140 align:start position:0%
that's why it's yeah but the question is
 
03:14:29.750 --> 03:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
where's the line item for the money
 
03:14:31.370 --> 03:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
right now there's money that's paying
 
03:14:34.790 --> 03:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
for it from DHHS well presumably but
 
03:14:36.950 --> 03:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's worth the line to know who's
 
03:14:39.349 --> 03:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
in charge of paying for it it's their
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:47.389 --> 03:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
if I may
 
03:14:47.399 --> 03:14:48.230 align:start position:0%
if I may
um

03:14:48.230 --> 03:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:51.230 --> 03:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
when we were allocated funds to pay for
 
03:14:53.389 --> 03:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
residential treatment it was not
 
03:14:56.870 --> 03:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
anticipated that this would create such
 
03:14:59.510 --> 03:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
confusion on the IEPs we were not
 
03:15:01.730 --> 03:15:01.740 align:start position:0%
budgeted to pay for Education expenses
 
03:15:03.650 --> 03:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
our we were paying for it out of
 
03:15:06.230 --> 03:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment dollars in order
 
03:15:08.450 --> 03:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
to ensure that children are being
 
03:15:10.969 --> 03:15:10.979 align:start position:0%
educated which means we can't serve as
 
03:15:13.190 --> 03:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
many children
 
03:15:15.410 --> 03:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
um therapeutically because we're
 
03:15:17.690 --> 03:15:17.700 align:start position:0%
covering the cost of special education
 
03:15:21.290 --> 03:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
so there is no line item for education
 
03:15:25.730 --> 03:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
in my budget but it's being covered at
 
03:15:28.849 --> 03:15:28.859 align:start position:0%
the detriment of what we're statutorily
 
03:15:30.950 --> 03:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
charged with covering but getting to the
 
03:15:32.650 --> 03:15:32.660 align:start position:0%
essence of that comment
 
03:15:37.070 --> 03:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
how much is it how much is that budget
 
03:15:40.190 --> 03:15:40.200 align:start position:0%
my residential budget
 
03:15:42.590 --> 03:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
um I mean I I would have to go back we
 
03:15:42.600 --> 03:15:44.090 align:start position:0%
um I mean I I would have to go back we
it's

03:15:44.090 --> 03:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:15:46.610 --> 03:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
for this population I would have to pull
 
03:15:47.990 --> 03:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
it apart and get back to you because
 
03:15:50.389 --> 03:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
it's such mixed funding we have
 
03:15:52.670 --> 03:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
contracts but some of it is dcyf funding
 
03:15:55.370 --> 03:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
some of it is Medicaid funding and then
 
03:15:57.410 --> 03:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
there's a mix and so I would have to put
 
03:15:59.450 --> 03:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
a picture on the spot yeah it's just
 
03:16:02.710 --> 03:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
complicated you got to build before us
 
03:16:05.690 --> 03:16:05.700 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it's codifying what we're
 
03:16:07.070 --> 03:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
already doing
 
03:16:10.610 --> 03:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:13.790 --> 03:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
yes but and it's coming out is coming
 
03:16:17.330 --> 03:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
out of a budget the 350 number
 
03:16:18.590 --> 03:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:16:21.469 --> 03:16:21.479 align:start position:0%
through the year or today
 
03:16:23.809 --> 03:16:23.819 align:start position:0%
that's a point in time or an average
 
03:16:28.610 --> 03:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
point in time but the 350 number is
 
03:16:28.620 --> 03:16:29.269 align:start position:0%
point in time but the 350 number is
um

03:16:29.269 --> 03:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:32.809 --> 03:16:32.819 align:start position:0%
includes the whole dcyf population so
 
03:16:35.269 --> 03:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
we're not anticipating that the the
 
03:16:38.150 --> 03:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
number that we're looking at for the
 
03:16:40.010 --> 03:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
next couple years right now if we're at
 
03:16:42.110 --> 03:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
70 by the end of the month I think it's
 
03:16:43.910 --> 03:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
realistic to say that we would be
 
03:16:46.730 --> 03:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
serving around a hundred over the next
 
03:16:49.490 --> 03:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
biennium at any point in time
 
03:16:52.670 --> 03:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
um and 75 percent of that will be
 
03:16:56.450 --> 03:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
special education or kids with IEPs so
 
03:16:58.309 --> 03:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
if we're looking at we're looking at the
 
03:17:00.710 --> 03:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
cost of education for approximately 75
 
03:17:02.750 --> 03:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
to 100 youth per year
 
03:17:04.790 --> 03:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
and how much is
 
03:17:04.800 --> 03:17:06.410 align:start position:0%
and how much is
budgetarily

03:17:06.410 --> 03:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
budgetarily
 
03:17:09.110 --> 03:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
help me here sure what should we budget
 
03:17:11.690 --> 03:17:11.700 align:start position:0%
so it's annualized
 
03:17:16.010 --> 03:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
um and depending on the severity and of
 
03:17:19.250 --> 03:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
the illness and the needs of the youth
 
03:17:21.889 --> 03:17:21.899 align:start position:0%
are programs educational rates range
 
03:17:25.790 --> 03:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
from 150 to 450 a day
 
03:17:25.800 --> 03:17:26.389 align:start position:0%
from 150 to 450 a day
um

03:17:26.389 --> 03:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:30.590 --> 03:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
times 365 because it's annualized so in
 
03:17:35.389 --> 03:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:38.570 --> 03:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
that means it's about this big if I had
 
03:17:40.370 --> 03:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
planned on being here today I could have
 
03:17:43.070 --> 03:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
done that math at least napkin math a
 
03:17:45.349 --> 03:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
little bit better but um when we looked
 
03:17:47.030 --> 03:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
at it we were looking at about two
 
03:17:49.429 --> 03:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year
 
03:17:49.439 --> 03:17:50.630 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year
finally

03:17:50.630 --> 03:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
finally
 
03:17:54.410 --> 03:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
a number I don't trust that math that's
 
03:17:57.349 --> 03:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
my very very rough math but
 
03:17:58.849 --> 03:17:58.859 align:start position:0%
um but that that's who we're talking
 
03:18:00.469 --> 03:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
about paying for their educational jobs
 
03:18:03.590 --> 03:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
could you put pencils and paper and did
 
03:18:06.290 --> 03:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
it come up if it's two million fine we
 
03:18:07.969 --> 03:18:07.979 align:start position:0%
need to we need to order a magnitude
 
03:18:07.979 --> 03:18:10.130 align:start position:0%
need to we need to order a magnitude
budgetarily

03:18:10.130 --> 03:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
budgetarily
 
03:18:12.590 --> 03:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and I just want to ask
 
03:18:12.600 --> 03:18:14.210 align:start position:0%
yeah and I just want to ask
um

03:18:14.210 --> 03:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:16.429 --> 03:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
what this bill will do I want to make
 
03:18:18.469 --> 03:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
sure we are all on the same page is that
 
03:18:19.910 --> 03:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
it would
 
03:18:23.870 --> 03:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
stop putting yoga your department on the
 
03:18:26.630 --> 03:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
hook for education and make sure that
 
03:18:28.790 --> 03:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
that education is taken care of by the
 
03:18:31.490 --> 03:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
doe either for relieving your budget so
 
03:18:33.230 --> 03:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
you can focus out on your core mission
 
03:18:35.510 --> 03:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
is and the deal we should focus on their
 
03:18:37.250 --> 03:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
core mission is instead of the current
 
03:18:37.260 --> 03:18:42.769 align:start position:0%
core mission is instead of the current
jumble

03:18:42.769 --> 03:18:42.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:45.530 --> 03:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
um implementation of this transformation
 
03:18:47.929 --> 03:18:47.939 align:start position:0%
is an iterative process and I think
 
03:18:49.070 --> 03:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
we've learned a lot in the first couple
 
03:18:50.389 --> 03:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
years we'll continue to learn but
 
03:18:52.190 --> 03:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely now we're now all we got to
 
03:18:54.769 --> 03:18:54.779 align:start position:0%
do is convince doe they got a new egg in
 
03:18:56.090 --> 03:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
their basket
 
03:18:57.530 --> 03:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
well they give them money they'll be
 
03:18:59.389 --> 03:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
happy yeah that's what I'm saying I mean
 
03:19:00.889 --> 03:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
we're going to budget somebody to do
 
03:19:02.510 --> 03:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
this so so
 
03:19:04.730 --> 03:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
I just want to go back to court ordered
 
03:19:07.250 --> 03:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
placements that line in the budget
 
03:19:12.050 --> 03:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
so does it make sense to add
 
03:19:15.889 --> 03:19:15.899 align:start position:0%
the popular specified population as
 
03:19:18.050 --> 03:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
maybe another like
 
03:19:21.050 --> 03:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
a underneath that line for this
 
03:19:23.929 --> 03:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
population at two million dollars I'm
 
03:19:26.389 --> 03:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
hearing because now quarter Replacements
 
03:19:28.309 --> 03:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
that's kind of like an open warrant sort
 
03:19:31.309 --> 03:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
of thing because it can go over and I I
 
03:19:33.469 --> 03:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
am feeling like this would need that
 
03:19:35.269 --> 03:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
same kind of thing does that make sense
 
03:19:37.910 --> 03:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to say
 
03:19:41.330 --> 03:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
yes but I I am also who's budgets it in
 
03:19:43.690 --> 03:19:43.700 align:start position:0%
because right now you always
 
03:19:45.950 --> 03:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
yeah okay there's four and a half
 
03:19:48.050 --> 03:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
million per year included in the
 
03:19:49.250 --> 03:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget for court
 
03:19:51.170 --> 03:19:51.180 align:start position:0%
ordered placements and there is a
 
03:19:52.910 --> 03:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
statutory open warrant so if that actual
 
03:19:55.070 --> 03:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
cost has to be six million dollars doe
 
03:19:56.330 --> 03:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
can draw a warrant for the additional
 
03:19:57.769 --> 03:19:57.779 align:start position:0%
amount they need outside of the budget
 
03:20:00.050 --> 03:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
process to pay that liability
 
03:20:01.730 --> 03:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
this would include the episode of
 
03:20:04.070 --> 03:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
treatments in that line item right so
 
03:20:06.230 --> 03:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
along the lines if if two million
 
03:20:07.550 --> 03:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
dollars ends up being the number that
 
03:20:08.929 --> 03:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
this committee is comfortable with we
 
03:20:10.070 --> 03:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
would increase
 
03:20:12.590 --> 03:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
this 400 and a half to six and a half to
 
03:20:14.809 --> 03:20:14.819 align:start position:0%
reflect the cost of this bill but that
 
03:20:16.250 --> 03:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
open warrant would still be there if
 
03:20:17.870 --> 03:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
your estimate is wrong
 
03:20:20.990 --> 03:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
well we would have to amend this bill uh
 
03:20:23.929 --> 03:20:23.939 align:start position:0%
not necessarily so with this being a
 
03:20:25.610 --> 03:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
direct budget impact bill this would be
 
03:20:27.530 --> 03:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
one you'd consider retaining and we
 
03:20:29.750 --> 03:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
would put this in House Bill too also as
 
03:20:31.309 --> 03:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
part of House Bill 2 there is a change
 
03:20:32.570 --> 03:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
court ordered placements has
 
03:20:34.070 --> 03:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
historically been a general fund charge
 
03:20:36.530 --> 03:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
this budget changes that to an education
 
03:20:38.389 --> 03:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
trust fund so there's already a section
 
03:20:40.190 --> 03:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 relative to the source
 
03:20:42.410 --> 03:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
of funding for so there is a Nexus of
 
03:20:44.090 --> 03:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
putting this in-house Bill too with that
 
03:20:45.830 --> 03:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
section with the funding levels as part
 
03:20:47.630 --> 03:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
of your budget just goes right there too
 
03:20:50.450 --> 03:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
so you've got a partner yeah got a new
 
03:20:52.070 --> 03:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
partner called Department of Education
 
03:20:54.050 --> 03:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
yes which is a good thing we partnered
 
03:20:55.730 --> 03:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
with them regularly well I'm just saying
 
03:20:57.469 --> 03:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
this but that is you heard you heard it
 
03:21:00.950 --> 03:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
here yes so Mickey do we entertain a
 
03:21:04.790 --> 03:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
motion now to retain yes fold it hold it
 
03:21:07.250 --> 03:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
with emotions
 
03:21:09.230 --> 03:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
while you're doing your paperwork and I
 
03:21:10.910 --> 03:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
say thank you for the explanation this
 
03:21:12.710 --> 03:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
really helped thank you for identifying
 
03:21:14.450 --> 03:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
the population which I was a hard time
 
03:21:16.550 --> 03:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
figuring out and thank you for
 
03:21:18.650 --> 03:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
differentiating that these are students
 
03:21:20.269 --> 03:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
who haven't done anything criminal who
 
03:21:21.769 --> 03:21:21.779 align:start position:0%
should not be in a punitive situation
 
03:21:23.929 --> 03:21:23.939 align:start position:0%
and this is their Avenue to deal with
 
03:21:25.429 --> 03:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
that issue without having to go through
 
03:21:26.870 --> 03:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
the police and you know the issues we've
 
03:21:28.490 --> 03:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
had with that so thank you for all that
 
03:21:31.190 --> 03:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you all for your support of
 
03:21:33.230 --> 03:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
the system of care we're really already
 
03:21:37.550 --> 03:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
seeing the benefits of it good amazing
 
03:21:40.250 --> 03:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
we don't have chairman Weiler and the
 
03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
motion was by to retain no cool I did it
 
03:21:48.670 --> 03:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:52.190 --> 03:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
so so when we do a another budget work
 
03:21:53.870 --> 03:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
session if you recall the schedule that
 
03:21:55.610 --> 03:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
I had yesterday carrying the cost of the
 
03:21:57.410 --> 03:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
bills I'll include this when the
 
03:21:59.210 --> 03:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
retained bills and I'll work with the
 
03:22:00.469 --> 03:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:22:02.030 --> 03:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
and Department of Education and make
 
03:22:04.190 --> 03:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
sure 2 million a year is what they think
 
03:22:05.929 --> 03:22:05.939 align:start position:0%
give them a chance to go back and look
 
03:22:08.269 --> 03:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
and then we could add that if you
 
03:22:09.769 --> 03:22:09.779 align:start position:0%
support this bill we'd incorporate it
 
03:22:11.630 --> 03:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
but that's an open open warrant it is
 
03:22:12.889 --> 03:22:12.899 align:start position:0%
still an open warrant but at least
 
03:22:15.950 --> 03:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
there's a some reflection of you guys
 
03:22:17.210 --> 03:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
are recognizing that it's going to cost
 
03:22:18.889 --> 03:22:18.899 align:start position:0%
a little bit more than under current law
 
03:22:20.929 --> 03:22:20.939 align:start position:0%
because you're making this change yeah I
 
03:22:22.610 --> 03:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
had to change the uh
 
03:22:24.710 --> 03:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
definition of that line
 
03:22:27.230 --> 03:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
well if it's all under court order yeah
 
03:22:28.790 --> 03:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
I mean the title of that accounting unit
 
03:22:31.130 --> 03:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
is court ordered placements uh so we
 
03:22:32.750 --> 03:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
could do a little bit of finagling so
 
03:22:34.790 --> 03:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
there's it's transparent that it's court
 
03:22:36.650 --> 03:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
ordered placements and episode of
 
03:22:37.790 --> 03:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
treatment you know or whatever we could
 
03:22:40.250 --> 03:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
come up with something okay so we have a
 
03:22:42.349 --> 03:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
who who seconded it
 
03:22:44.210 --> 03:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
um Kate I have the second I'm good all
 
03:22:47.330 --> 03:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
in favor of retaining
 
03:22:50.769 --> 03:22:50.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:54.710 --> 03:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
unanimous wow that's another one down to
 
03:22:54.720 --> 03:22:57.170 align:start position:0%
unanimous wow that's another one down to
okay

03:22:57.170 --> 03:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:22:57.180 --> 03:23:02.630 align:start position:0%
okay
yeah

03:23:02.630 --> 03:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:06.889 --> 03:23:06.899 align:start position:0%
sure sure oh my God
 
03:23:18.469 --> 03:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:20.450 --> 03:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
which one you want to do first I'll do 6
 
03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
21st this should be really quick
 
03:23:27.050 --> 03:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Mary Heath and
 
03:23:28.670 --> 03:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
I represent
 
03:23:31.370 --> 03:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
um District 41 in Manchester and that's
 
03:23:34.490 --> 03:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
words two four five and seven
 
03:23:36.290 --> 03:23:36.300 align:start position:0%
um 6 20
 
03:23:38.269 --> 03:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
um but basically what it does it
 
03:23:38.279 --> 03:23:40.070 align:start position:0%
um but basically what it does it
establishes

03:23:40.070 --> 03:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
establishes
 
03:23:42.050 --> 03:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
um a department or division of early
 
03:23:44.330 --> 03:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
learning and in the Department of
 
03:23:48.410 --> 03:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
Education and it gives authority to the
 
03:23:50.870 --> 03:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
department to establish a three-year
 
03:23:54.170 --> 03:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
pilot program what I'm asking today is
 
03:23:58.729 --> 03:23:58.739 align:start position:0%
that in in hb2 the governor has a new
 
03:24:00.830 --> 03:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
team people it's efficiency that they're
 
03:24:02.170 --> 03:24:02.180 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at a lot of things
 
03:24:05.330 --> 03:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
and right now isn't the right time to do
 
03:24:09.590 --> 03:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
HB 620 I'm asking you just to retain it
 
03:24:11.330 --> 03:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
um and then we can take action on it
 
03:24:13.429 --> 03:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
later but I am not asking to have it
 
03:24:16.010 --> 03:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
included in the budget at this time so
 
03:24:17.690 --> 03:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
if you'll indulge me and think about
 
03:24:22.370 --> 03:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:22.380 --> 03:24:23.690 align:start position:0%
 
by

03:24:23.690 --> 03:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:24:27.050 --> 03:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
Joe Petri oh second give me a second

they're good
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
okay and it's always in favor of
 
03:24:37.439 --> 03:24:40.550 align:start position:0%
okay and it's always in favor of
retaining

03:24:40.550 --> 03:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:40.560 --> 03:24:43.849 align:start position:0%

03:25:20.090 --> 03:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
my name is Laura Milliken I'm the
 
03:25:21.830 --> 03:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
executive director of hunger New
 
03:25:25.370 --> 03:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:27.349 --> 03:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
and I know we had some questions
 
03:25:29.269 --> 03:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
yesterday I don't I didn't know if you
 
03:25:31.690 --> 03:25:31.700 align:start position:0%
had any extra questions
 
03:25:38.210 --> 03:25:38.220 align:start position:0%
my intent would be to ask that we ask
 
03:25:38.220 --> 03:25:39.889 align:start position:0%
my intent would be to ask that we ask
Mickey

03:25:39.889 --> 03:25:39.899 align:start position:0%
Mickey
 
03:25:42.729 --> 03:25:42.739 align:start position:0%
um to create an amendment that would be
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored by representative Petrie
 
03:25:49.450 --> 03:25:49.460 align:start position:0%
and myself with the purpose of
 
03:25:51.830 --> 03:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
authorizing the Department of Education
 
03:25:54.229 --> 03:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
and Health and Human Services
 
03:25:57.490 --> 03:25:57.500 align:start position:0%
to enter to
 
03:26:00.290 --> 03:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
provide the authority
 
03:26:05.150 --> 03:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
to those agencies when the
 
03:26:07.550 --> 03:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
direct certification Medicaid direct
 
03:26:11.090 --> 03:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
certification RFP becomes available is
 
03:26:14.870 --> 03:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:19.250 --> 03:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
so USDA will release an RFP to allow new
 
03:26:22.790 --> 03:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
states to participate in the Medicaid
 
03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
direct certification pilot project at 39
 
03:26:28.130 --> 03:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
states are already members of
 
03:26:31.130 --> 03:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
and at this point in time this probably
 
03:26:37.370 --> 03:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
would not be available until 26 2026 so
 
03:26:48.229 --> 03:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:51.889 --> 03:26:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:58.790 --> 03:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:01.729 --> 03:27:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:03.229 --> 03:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
um so I don't
 
03:27:06.530 --> 03:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
I don't think any funding is required at
 
03:27:08.269 --> 03:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
this time Mickey I don't know if you
 
03:27:11.510 --> 03:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:14.809 --> 03:27:14.819 align:start position:0%
uh so the Department of Education had
 
03:27:16.729 --> 03:27:16.739 align:start position:0%
identified some costs and they're in the
 
03:27:19.610 --> 03:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
room now relative to fiscal 24 and 25
 
03:27:22.309 --> 03:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
the significant cost where this change
 
03:27:23.929 --> 03:27:23.939 align:start position:0%
of direct certification could impact
 
03:27:26.389 --> 03:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
adequacy wouldn't be until fiscal 26 so
 
03:27:29.090 --> 03:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
there's there's I'd say minimal payments
 
03:27:31.729 --> 03:27:31.739 align:start position:0%
or minimal expenditures in this biennium
 
03:27:33.889 --> 03:27:33.899 align:start position:0%
relative to this it'd be the following
 
03:27:35.929 --> 03:27:35.939 align:start position:0%
biennium so to the amendment then we
 
03:27:38.210 --> 03:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
would need to add that
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
dollar figure
 
03:27:42.830 --> 03:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and I would just want to be clear
 
03:27:45.050 --> 03:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
on on the amendment so working off of
 
03:27:47.630 --> 03:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
the bill as before us can we be I just
 
03:27:49.190 --> 03:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
want to be clear of what we want to add
 
03:27:54.710 --> 03:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:56.510 --> 03:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
so do you have a copy of the bill there
 
03:28:04.610 --> 03:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:07.550 --> 03:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
so this bill direct it directs
 
03:28:09.889 --> 03:28:09.899 align:start position:0%
it directs the department of Ed and
 
03:28:11.750 --> 03:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
03:28:11.760 --> 03:28:13.130 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
to

03:28:13.130 --> 03:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:28:13.140 --> 03:28:16.010 align:start position:0%
to
um

03:28:16.010 --> 03:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:18.349 --> 03:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
seek participation in the Medicaid
 
03:28:20.510 --> 03:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
direct certification methodology for
 
03:28:22.729 --> 03:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
School meals for pre and reduced lunch
 
03:28:24.650 --> 03:28:24.660 align:start position:0%
so we're
 
03:28:24.660 --> 03:28:26.389 align:start position:0%
so we're
um

03:28:26.389 --> 03:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:29.690 --> 03:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
just asking for the authority
 
03:28:31.610 --> 03:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
be given to the Department of Ed and
 
03:28:37.670 --> 03:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:40.130 --> 03:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
which I I defer to the department I feel
 
03:28:41.990 --> 03:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
I think this does that already I'm not
 
03:28:44.030 --> 03:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
sure we would have to do anything we
 
03:28:45.530 --> 03:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
just so I think what you would probably
 
03:28:47.929 --> 03:28:47.939 align:start position:0%
be looking to do is uh you just want to
 
03:28:49.190 --> 03:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
incorporate this into house bill too
 
03:28:52.790 --> 03:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
yeah which you can yep representative
 
03:28:55.309 --> 03:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
Petrie are you agreeable with that
 
03:28:55.319 --> 03:28:57.290 align:start position:0%
Petrie are you agreeable with that
so

03:28:57.290 --> 03:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:28:59.389 --> 03:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
are you okay I don't know what is there
 
03:29:01.370 --> 03:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
an amendment we're just looking at 601
 
03:29:12.229 --> 03:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:14.210 --> 03:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
and I will say I'm sorry to I think
 
03:29:16.250 --> 03:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd had hoped to speak
 
03:29:18.469 --> 03:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
on this bill so I don't know if you want
 
03:29:21.889 --> 03:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
to recess this and hear from him or if
 
03:29:23.809 --> 03:29:23.819 align:start position:0%
you're good I just know he had he had
 
03:29:25.849 --> 03:29:25.859 align:start position:0%
indicated that uh he would he was going
 
03:29:27.710 --> 03:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
to come back for 601 I don't think he I
 
03:29:28.610 --> 03:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
don't think he knew we were going to
 
03:29:30.349 --> 03:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
jump order so he was going to come back
 
03:29:38.950 --> 03:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:41.269 --> 03:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
there is no need to recess we can listen
 
03:29:43.790 --> 03:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
to him anytime because it's retained so
 
03:29:45.469 --> 03:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
we can just hear we can recess and I can
 
03:29:46.670 --> 03:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
get down and get him because he's going
 
03:29:57.110 --> 03:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:59.870 --> 03:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any difference and we
 
03:30:01.969 --> 03:30:01.979 align:start position:0%
still have to listen and work on it so I
 
03:30:04.370 --> 03:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:13.670 --> 03:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:18.670 --> 03:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:44.090 --> 03:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:52.670 --> 03:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:52.680 --> 03:30:54.590 align:start position:0%
 
just

03:30:54.590 --> 03:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:00:35.929 --> 04:00:35.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:38.389 --> 04:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
come back to the break at two o'clock
 
04:00:41.870 --> 04:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
and we will be uh open the work session
 
04:00:46.429 --> 04:00:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:49.189 --> 04:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
04:00:50.809 --> 04:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
good afternoon colleagues of mine on
 
04:00:53.210 --> 04:00:53.220 align:start position:0%
finance here in division two for the
 
04:00:55.670 --> 04:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
record I'm representative Maureen Mooney
 
04:00:58.490 --> 04:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
I'm the prime sponsor in speaking in
 
04:01:01.610 --> 04:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 272 an act
 
04:01:04.010 --> 04:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
relative to increasing chartered Public
 
04:01:07.610 --> 04:01:07.620 align:start position:0%
School per pupil funding
 
04:01:10.729 --> 04:01:10.739 align:start position:0%
now just a quick review of how charter
 
04:01:13.010 --> 04:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
schools are funded in New Hampshire
 
04:01:16.490 --> 04:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
using this Formula First it's the base
 
04:01:18.590 --> 04:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid
 
04:01:21.710 --> 04:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
plus what is then called an additional
 
04:01:27.590 --> 04:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
Grant and that's found in RSA 194 hyphen
 
04:01:31.910 --> 04:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
B colon 11 and so forth my bill House
 
04:01:36.189 --> 04:01:36.199 align:start position:0%
Bill 272 Deals Only with the additional
 
04:01:40.969 --> 04:01:40.979 align:start position:0%
grant part of the formula only with that
 
04:01:43.429 --> 04:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
also I want to add that Charter Schools
 
04:01:45.910 --> 04:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
do receive money it differentiated AIDS
 
04:01:48.530 --> 04:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
Aid specifically for free and reduced
 
04:01:50.210 --> 04:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
lunch English English as a second
 
04:01:51.769 --> 04:01:51.779 align:start position:0%
Learners and so forth but that's
 
04:01:54.110 --> 04:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
additional to the two pieces of the
 
04:01:57.229 --> 04:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
formula I just went over
 
04:02:00.170 --> 04:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 272 again dealing only
 
04:02:02.269 --> 04:02:02.279 align:start position:0%
with the additional Grant
 
04:02:04.929 --> 04:02:04.939 align:start position:0%
piece of the formula as amended
 
04:02:08.389 --> 04:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
increases the statutory additional Grant
 
04:02:10.309 --> 04:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
given to public charter schools per
 
04:02:18.349 --> 04:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:21.590 --> 04:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
overall with this increase
 
04:02:24.769 --> 04:02:24.779 align:start position:0%
in the additional Grant total per pupil
 
04:02:27.889 --> 04:02:27.899 align:start position:0%
for public chartered schools
 
04:02:29.870 --> 04:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
based on the public charter school
 
04:02:31.670 --> 04:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
funding formula
 
04:02:34.210 --> 04:02:34.220 align:start position:0%
with the governors across the board
 
04:02:38.210 --> 04:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
increase in adequacy Aid
 
04:02:40.250 --> 04:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
would then give
 
04:02:43.729 --> 04:02:43.739 align:start position:0%
chartered school pupils nine thousand
 
04:02:46.790 --> 04:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
dollars per pupil
 
04:02:48.769 --> 04:02:48.779 align:start position:0%
for the charter school now this is an
 
04:02:51.650 --> 04:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
increase from what it is now right now
 
04:02:54.650 --> 04:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
a student who attends a chartered public
 
04:02:56.809 --> 04:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
chartered school
 
04:03:00.170 --> 04:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
that chartered School receives between 7
 
04:03:00.180 --> 04:03:01.729 align:start position:0%
that chartered School receives between 7
300

04:03:01.729 --> 04:03:01.739 align:start position:0%
300
 
04:03:04.070 --> 04:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
and seventy five hundred dollars per
 
04:03:04.080 --> 04:03:05.809 align:start position:0%
and seventy five hundred dollars per
pupil

04:03:05.809 --> 04:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
04:03:07.550 --> 04:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
my bill
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
plus the governor's adequacy increase
 
04:03:12.469 --> 04:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
would then raise that amount to nine
 
04:03:15.650 --> 04:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per chartered school
 
04:03:15.660 --> 04:03:18.410 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per chartered school
pupil

04:03:18.410 --> 04:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
04:03:20.330 --> 04:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
there are several reasons for this
 
04:03:22.910 --> 04:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
increase in the additional Grant
 
04:03:22.920 --> 04:03:25.010 align:start position:0%
increase in the additional Grant
including

04:03:25.010 --> 04:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
including
 
04:03:27.530 --> 04:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
the additional Grant has not been
 
04:03:32.689 --> 04:03:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:35.090 --> 04:03:35.100 align:start position:0%
funding at nine thousand dollars per
 
04:03:37.250 --> 04:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
pupil is still lower than traditional
 
04:03:39.410 --> 04:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
Public Schools where the most recent
 
04:03:41.870 --> 04:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
figure is an average of about nineteen
 
04:03:44.809 --> 04:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per pupil
 
04:03:47.809 --> 04:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
and another reason for the bill is an
 
04:03:50.990 --> 04:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
increased funding is needed for the
 
04:03:54.110 --> 04:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
increased enrollment that public charter
 
04:03:57.950 --> 04:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
schools have received over the past few
 
04:03:57.960 --> 04:03:59.750 align:start position:0%
schools have received over the past few
years

04:03:59.750 --> 04:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:04:02.210 --> 04:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
also want to make mention that this bill
 
04:04:06.370 --> 04:04:06.380 align:start position:0%
House Bill 272 passed the entire house
 
04:04:10.729 --> 04:04:10.739 align:start position:0%
on a Division vote on the 22nd of March
 
04:04:14.229 --> 04:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
the division vote being
 
04:04:17.450 --> 04:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
348 to 11.
 
04:04:20.450 --> 04:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
quite an outstanding bipartisan
 
04:04:20.460 --> 04:04:22.189 align:start position:0%
quite an outstanding bipartisan
statement

04:04:22.189 --> 04:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
statement
 
04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
on behalf of our public chartered
 
04:04:27.889 --> 04:04:27.899 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire is to see the
 
04:04:31.130 --> 04:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
increase that takes place in this bill
 
04:04:32.570 --> 04:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
04:04:34.790 --> 04:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
I would ask that you
 
04:04:37.670 --> 04:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
adopt the bill or incorporate the bill
 
04:04:41.450 --> 04:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
into House Bill 2 so that we can see a
 
04:04:44.450 --> 04:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
much needed increase happen for our
 
04:04:47.510 --> 04:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
public chartered school pupils with that
 
04:04:49.189 --> 04:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
I'll close my testimony and I do have
 
04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
others that wish to talk after me thank
 
04:04:53.870 --> 04:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
you but we could also go forward with
 
04:04:55.849 --> 04:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
the bill as a standalone
 
04:04:55.859 --> 04:04:57.710 align:start position:0%
the bill as a standalone
yes

04:04:57.710 --> 04:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:05:01.450 --> 04:05:01.460 align:start position:0%
we're 348 to 11.
 
04:05:01.460 --> 04:05:03.309 align:start position:0%
we're 348 to 11.
Mickey

04:05:03.309 --> 04:05:03.319 align:start position:0%
Mickey
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's a couple reasons why we I don't
 
04:05:07.849 --> 04:05:07.859 align:start position:0%
think we can do that one this would
 
04:05:09.290 --> 04:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
carry a price tag so we would have to
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
have a corresponding budget adjustment
 
04:05:13.370 --> 04:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
to reflect the increase associated with
 
04:05:15.290 --> 04:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
this bill and two there is a house bill
 
04:05:17.450 --> 04:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
2 Section relative to charter school
 
04:05:20.090 --> 04:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
funding in that it changes the CPI
 
04:05:22.729 --> 04:05:22.739 align:start position:0%
adjustment to uh that two percent per
 
04:05:24.530 --> 04:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
year that the governor had proposed so
 
04:05:28.189 --> 04:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
okay RSA 194 B colon 11 is amended
 
04:05:29.689 --> 04:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
in-house Bill too so I just worry about
 
04:05:31.969 --> 04:05:31.979 align:start position:0%
conflicting me so the motion would be to
 
04:05:36.950 --> 04:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:39.410 --> 04:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
yeah this law is already in there the
 
04:05:40.910 --> 04:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
increase of that represent Moody's
 
04:05:42.530 --> 04:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
proposing is not but that could be done
 
04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
with an amendment for sure
 
04:05:44.399 --> 04:05:46.130 align:start position:0%
with an amendment for sure
yeah

04:05:46.130 --> 04:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:05:47.809 --> 04:05:47.819 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
04:05:49.429 --> 04:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
you for being here
 
04:05:52.670 --> 04:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
um how many kids does this uh affect if
 
04:05:53.870 --> 04:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:05:58.010 --> 04:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
right now there are about 4 900
 
04:05:59.990 --> 04:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
students enrolled in public charter
 
04:06:04.189 --> 04:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:08.450 --> 04:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
and I'll make that motion okay motion
 
04:06:13.189 --> 04:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
to retain and move it into hb2 by Joe
 
04:06:15.889 --> 04:06:15.899 align:start position:0%
Petri second by mayor Heath all those in
 
04:06:15.899 --> 04:06:17.929 align:start position:0%
Petri second by mayor Heath all those in
favor

04:06:17.929 --> 04:06:17.939 align:start position:0%
favor
 
04:06:20.689 --> 04:06:20.699 align:start position:0%
okay that's unanimous
 
04:06:22.309 --> 04:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
04:06:23.990 --> 04:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I would just

04:06:28.570 --> 04:06:28.580 align:start position:0%
would you like to for me to draft that
 
04:06:33.370 --> 04:06:33.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:35.929 --> 04:06:35.939 align:start position:0%

04:06:58.560 --> 04:07:56.570 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:07:56.570 --> 04:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:59.389 --> 04:07:59.399 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
04:08:02.750 --> 04:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh anybody here for 4 30
 
04:08:06.349 --> 04:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
HB 430 I should say
 
04:08:08.269 --> 04:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
the education
 
04:08:16.670 --> 04:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:16.680 --> 04:08:33.010 align:start position:0%
 
please

04:08:33.010 --> 04:08:33.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:28.610 --> 04:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:31.010 --> 04:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm representative Sally
 
04:11:31.020 --> 04:11:32.570 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm representative Sally
fellows

04:11:32.570 --> 04:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
04:11:35.689 --> 04:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
um I hope you will look favorably on to
 
04:11:37.870 --> 04:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
HB 529
 
04:11:41.630 --> 04:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
what it does is it distributes about
 
04:11:44.269 --> 04:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
a little under a hundred million dollars
 
04:11:47.090 --> 04:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
to primarily the school districts that
 
04:11:49.490 --> 04:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
need it the most
 
04:11:52.610 --> 04:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
um this current year that we're in
 
04:11:56.510 --> 04:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
the school districts are benefiting from
 
04:11:58.849 --> 04:11:58.859 align:start position:0%
the reduction of the swep
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
T by 100 million dollars but that is
 
04:12:04.729 --> 04:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to next year that was a
 
04:12:09.849 --> 04:12:09.859 align:start position:0%
one-year deal so the 100 million in 529
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
is pretty much a replacement
 
04:12:15.769 --> 04:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
in terms of what the state is
 
04:12:18.650 --> 04:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
contributing for that it does distribute
 
04:12:24.889 --> 04:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:28.010 --> 04:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
questions from the floor yes very thank
 
04:12:30.590 --> 04:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so Sally thank you for
 
04:12:32.210 --> 04:12:32.220 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
04:12:32.220 --> 04:12:33.250 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
fellows

04:12:33.250 --> 04:12:33.260 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
04:12:35.450 --> 04:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
selling I've known each other for a long
 
04:12:35.460 --> 04:12:37.189 align:start position:0%
selling I've known each other for a long
time

04:12:37.189 --> 04:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:12:37.199 --> 04:12:38.510 align:start position:0%
time
um

04:12:38.510 --> 04:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
could you just describe the additional
 
04:12:46.250 --> 04:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
Aid grants the fiscal capacity disparity
 
04:12:51.410 --> 04:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
in the the fnr in terms of your bill
 
04:12:53.510 --> 04:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
um okay I I did not come prepared for
 
04:12:55.550 --> 04:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
this I don't have the spreadsheet that I
 
04:12:58.910 --> 04:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
did okay but um I can tell you that the
 
04:13:02.750 --> 04:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity has to do with
 
04:13:07.910 --> 04:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
the property tax base that is available
 
04:13:10.189 --> 04:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
um to each of the communities these that
 
04:13:12.830 --> 04:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
receive funding so the ones with the
 
04:13:15.950 --> 04:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
lowest property tax base receive the
 
04:13:19.610 --> 04:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
most per pupil and the amount that each
 
04:13:22.429 --> 04:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
Community receives in some cases that's
 
04:13:27.170 --> 04:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
zero is on a sliding scale so the ones
 
04:13:30.429 --> 04:13:30.439 align:start position:0%
with the lowest valuation per student
 
04:13:35.030 --> 04:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
receive the most per student and
 
04:13:37.729 --> 04:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
um the so that's how the fiscal capacity
 
04:13:41.450 --> 04:13:41.460 align:start position:0%
disparity part works and the other half
 
04:13:44.330 --> 04:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
of the well it's not that's um I don't
 
04:13:46.189 --> 04:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
have in front of me I think the majority
 
04:13:48.290 --> 04:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
of the money is distributed under that
 
04:13:52.370 --> 04:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
formula I think about 80 ml million and
 
04:13:56.689 --> 04:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
about 17 million is distributed on the
 
04:13:59.750 --> 04:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
same kind of sliding formula but it has
 
04:14:01.729 --> 04:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
to do with the percentage of students
 
04:14:03.590 --> 04:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
that are eligible for free and reduced
 
04:14:03.600 --> 04:14:04.729 align:start position:0%
that are eligible for free and reduced
lunch

04:14:04.729 --> 04:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
04:14:07.490 --> 04:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
so in the governor's formula
 
04:14:10.370 --> 04:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
um the governor um gave us a nice boost
 
04:14:14.210 --> 04:14:14.220 align:start position:0%
in the um base numbers
 
04:14:16.370 --> 04:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
um How would
 
04:14:19.670 --> 04:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
what would happen if we were to take the
 
04:14:19.680 --> 04:14:20.809 align:start position:0%
what would happen if we were to take the
two

04:14:20.809 --> 04:14:20.819 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:14:22.790 --> 04:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
that you've specified in this bill
 
04:14:24.530 --> 04:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
because the governor does have pretty
 
04:14:26.689 --> 04:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch but I think this would
 
04:14:29.150 --> 04:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
maybe would add something to it and then
 
04:14:32.330 --> 04:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
the fiscal capacity
 
04:14:35.090 --> 04:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
if we added those two
 
04:14:35.100 --> 04:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
if we added those two
um

04:14:35.750 --> 04:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:39.530 --> 04:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
to his formula where would we get where
 
04:14:42.590 --> 04:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.600 --> 04:14:43.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:14:43.849 --> 04:14:43.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:46.670 --> 04:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
and I think do you mean in terms of cost
 
04:14:49.250 --> 04:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
cost to the state in terms of cost to
 
04:14:51.170 --> 04:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
the state and that's an awful question
 
04:14:54.110 --> 04:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
to ask you off the top of your head I I
 
04:14:57.769 --> 04:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry but you know what I bet
 
04:14:59.990 --> 04:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
um well I know that the the two pieces
 
04:15:02.510 --> 04:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
from 529 are
 
04:15:04.929 --> 04:15:04.939 align:start position:0%
um adds up to
 
04:15:07.790 --> 04:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
97 million dollars
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the governor's part
 
04:15:11.630 --> 04:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
does clear clearly
 
04:15:14.349 --> 04:15:14.359 align:start position:0%
my guess would be that that adds more
 
04:15:17.809 --> 04:15:17.819 align:start position:0%
all right but I don't uh clearly more I
 
04:15:19.130 --> 04:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
don't know how much and I think the
 
04:15:20.570 --> 04:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
Department's here and maybe they could
 
04:15:24.530 --> 04:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:27.710 --> 04:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:27.720 --> 04:15:29.809 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:15:29.809 --> 04:15:29.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:15:32.570 --> 04:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
I make the same observation always about
 
04:15:32.580 --> 04:15:33.530 align:start position:0%
I make the same observation always about
this

04:15:33.530 --> 04:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:15:36.710 --> 04:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh poverty payment for students that
 
04:15:38.689 --> 04:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
this is not for the meals it's for
 
04:15:41.210 --> 04:15:41.220 align:start position:0%
poverty payment
 
04:15:44.689 --> 04:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
there should be some programs for these
 
04:15:47.090 --> 04:15:47.100 align:start position:0%
students to give them extra help
 
04:15:49.490 --> 04:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
but there never is I've said for years
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
there should be a grant program based
 
04:15:54.710 --> 04:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
upon what are you doing for homework
 
04:15:56.809 --> 04:15:56.819 align:start position:0%
health for these children that are
 
04:15:59.090 --> 04:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
getting the admr it should be available
 
04:16:00.769 --> 04:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
to everybody but it specifically should
 
04:16:02.570 --> 04:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
be set up for those students because
 
04:16:03.830 --> 04:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
they're not probably getting much
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
homework I'll help at home
 
04:16:09.290 --> 04:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
and there should be a program in each
 
04:16:10.550 --> 04:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
School District
 
04:16:12.590 --> 04:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
specifically to help them and there
 
04:16:14.269 --> 04:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
never is I think there's one or two
 
04:16:17.030 --> 04:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
schools that do but they should all be
 
04:16:22.010 --> 04:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:23.570 --> 04:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
let's go back to understand a little
 
04:16:25.790 --> 04:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
better about you referenced swept which
 
04:16:28.729 --> 04:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
was a one-time you know last year one
 
04:16:30.650 --> 04:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
time went off
 
04:16:32.150 --> 04:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
um and I missed the connection between
 
04:16:35.630 --> 04:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:38.389 --> 04:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what was why was sweat
 
04:16:40.670 --> 04:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
brought up with regards to this when you
 
04:16:42.530 --> 04:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
gave your introductory remarks well
 
04:16:44.269 --> 04:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
that's just one of the ways that I look
 
04:16:46.910 --> 04:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
at it in terms of the the you know from
 
04:16:49.610 --> 04:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
the budget state budget perspective
 
04:16:49.620 --> 04:16:51.110 align:start position:0%
the budget state budget perspective
that

04:16:51.110 --> 04:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:16:54.229 --> 04:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
um what happened it's it's I don't you
 
04:16:55.610 --> 04:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
can call it last year or this
 
04:16:57.769 --> 04:16:57.779 align:start position:0%
technically we're in it's the fiscal
 
04:17:00.410 --> 04:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
year we're in right now by reducing
 
04:17:00.420 --> 04:17:02.330 align:start position:0%
year we're in right now by reducing
swept

04:17:02.330 --> 04:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
swept
 
04:17:03.410 --> 04:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
um that
 
04:17:07.550 --> 04:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
was a benefit to the school districts of
 
04:17:09.530 --> 04:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
about a hundred million dollars because
 
04:17:10.849 --> 04:17:10.859 align:start position:0%
that didn't have to come off their
 
04:17:13.370 --> 04:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
property tax bills and it also increased
 
04:17:16.550 --> 04:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
the adequacy aid so just in turn that
 
04:17:18.590 --> 04:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
just in terms of budget for the state
 
04:17:22.550 --> 04:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
those are sort of the unequal amount of
 
04:17:22.560 --> 04:17:24.650 align:start position:0%
those are sort of the unequal amount of
contribution

04:17:24.650 --> 04:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
04:17:26.630 --> 04:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
to the school district
 
04:17:29.570 --> 04:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
I guess what does this connect to this
 
04:17:29.580 --> 04:17:36.530 align:start position:0%
I guess what does this connect to this
bill

04:17:36.530 --> 04:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:37.849 --> 04:17:37.859 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:17:41.150 --> 04:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
well it it does it doesn't it doesn't it
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
just in terms of how it affects the
 
04:17:43.680 --> 04:17:45.950 align:start position:0%
just in terms of how it affects the
state

04:17:45.950 --> 04:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:48.590 --> 04:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
drill yeah well thank you Mr chairman
 
04:17:50.330 --> 04:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
and uh thanks for taking my question
 
04:17:53.210 --> 04:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
yeah this just really replaces the 100
 
04:17:56.150 --> 04:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
million it was taken out and and given
 
04:17:59.030 --> 04:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
to uh the tax base that that's that's
 
04:18:02.150 --> 04:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
one my my perspective you know it's it's
 
04:18:05.330 --> 04:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
they're both ways to
 
04:18:07.429 --> 04:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
um help out school districts financially
 
04:18:09.229 --> 04:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
and they're just two different
 
04:18:12.410 --> 04:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
mechanisms so you know one you know this
 
04:18:14.870 --> 04:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
year we're helping them out to the
 
04:18:16.490 --> 04:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
extent of a hundred million dollars
 
04:18:19.250 --> 04:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
through the sweat reduction and the
 
04:18:21.950 --> 04:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
proposal in 529 is to help them out to
 
04:18:24.830 --> 04:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
the tune of about 100 million dollars
 
04:18:27.530 --> 04:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
with a different formula
 
04:18:30.229 --> 04:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up could you could you get that
 
04:18:33.229 --> 04:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
uh chart that you have uh shown to
 
04:18:35.809 --> 04:18:35.819 align:start position:0%
different towns at some point I didn't
 
04:18:37.490 --> 04:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
bring it with me
 
04:18:43.070 --> 04:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:47.090 --> 04:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:48.889 --> 04:18:48.899 align:start position:0%
think the department has some detailed
 
04:18:50.269 --> 04:18:50.279 align:start position:0%
information we can provide to the
 
04:18:52.130 --> 04:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
committee on on this we we didn't get a
 
04:18:53.870 --> 04:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal note out on this bill because the
 
04:18:56.809 --> 04:18:56.819 align:start position:0%
data wasn't uh to us in time so we
 
04:18:58.490 --> 04:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
certainly as this committee proceeds
 
04:19:00.530 --> 04:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
with education funding will run all
 
04:19:02.150 --> 04:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
scenarios that the committee wants us to
 
04:19:06.530 --> 04:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
run including 529 as amended right house
 
04:19:09.110 --> 04:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
House Education committee has copy and
 
04:19:11.570 --> 04:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
other people might have copies
 
04:19:13.490 --> 04:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't bring it with me they
 
04:19:14.889 --> 04:19:14.899 align:start position:0%
don't handle the money
 
04:19:18.050 --> 04:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
can I just add that um representative
 
04:19:20.750 --> 04:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
fellows actually used to run the numbers
 
04:19:23.150 --> 04:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
at the department of Ed prior to her
 
04:19:25.969 --> 04:19:25.979 align:start position:0%
retirement so that she did provide us
 
04:19:28.010 --> 04:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
with um
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
um a per town
 
04:19:33.530 --> 04:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
estimate for each
 
04:19:36.889 --> 04:19:36.899 align:start position:0%
um and we do have that I don't know if
 
04:19:39.349 --> 04:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
the committee wants us to make copies of
 
04:19:41.330 --> 04:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
that or not
 
04:19:41.340 --> 04:19:44.510 align:start position:0%
that or not
well

04:19:44.510 --> 04:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:46.849 --> 04:19:46.859 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
04:19:48.889 --> 04:19:48.899 align:start position:0%
we'll receive that at some point I guess
 
04:19:50.510 --> 04:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
is this something
 
04:19:53.809 --> 04:19:53.819 align:start position:0%
in some form that already exists or is
 
04:19:55.910 --> 04:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
this new I um there's so many acronyms
 
04:19:57.610 --> 04:19:57.620 align:start position:0%
around here I don't know if
 
04:20:00.410 --> 04:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
admrs is something that's already in
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:13.870 --> 04:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:16.969 --> 04:20:16.979 align:start position:0%
so the way that works average daily
 
04:20:19.849 --> 04:20:19.859 align:start position:0%
membership is kind of a FTE full-time
 
04:20:23.210 --> 04:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
equivalent measure so if a student
 
04:20:25.790 --> 04:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
starts the school year but drops out or
 
04:20:28.429 --> 04:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
transfers to another state you know
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
halfway through then the school district
 
04:20:34.130 --> 04:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
gets credit for half a student and there
 
04:20:37.370 --> 04:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
are two adms average daily membership is
 
04:20:42.469 --> 04:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
the F FTE measure and if it if it's admr
 
04:20:45.170 --> 04:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
that means average daily membership in
 
04:20:49.429 --> 04:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
Residence that's a count of of students
 
04:20:52.969 --> 04:20:52.979 align:start position:0%
by the town that they reside in
 
04:20:56.870 --> 04:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
and if it's ADM a that's average daily
 
04:21:00.050 --> 04:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
membership in attendance that's the
 
04:21:02.330 --> 04:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
school district where they attend the
 
04:21:07.910 --> 04:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
schools because we have oh maybe
 
04:21:11.030 --> 04:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
13 something like that school districts
 
04:21:13.189 --> 04:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
that don't even operate schools because
 
04:21:14.389 --> 04:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
they're small
 
04:21:17.870 --> 04:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
and then we have quite a few towns that
 
04:21:20.929 --> 04:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
operate in elementary school district so
 
04:21:22.429 --> 04:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
they educate their own elementary
 
04:21:26.929 --> 04:21:26.939 align:start position:0%
students but they they tuition their
 
04:21:30.110 --> 04:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
high school students to another
 
04:21:32.150 --> 04:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
School District because they don't have
 
04:21:33.410 --> 04:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
a high school
 
04:21:36.170 --> 04:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
so for adequacy Aid what you're looking
 
04:21:40.130 --> 04:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
at here all of those measures are based
 
04:21:43.250 --> 04:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
on where the student lives
 
04:21:45.530 --> 04:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
and that's where the money goes to where
 
04:21:47.929 --> 04:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
the student lives because
 
04:21:50.870 --> 04:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
they're the ones the town are in some
 
04:21:54.110 --> 04:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
manner are going to pay tuition if they
 
04:21:58.490 --> 04:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:00.590 --> 04:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:22:02.410 --> 04:22:02.420 align:start position:0%
taking the questions
 
04:22:05.330 --> 04:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
at the time when this bill's bill was
 
04:22:07.969 --> 04:22:07.979 align:start position:0%
introduced you were not most likely yet
 
04:22:09.830 --> 04:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
aware of the you know Governor's budget
 
04:22:13.189 --> 04:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
proposal and whatnot does the you know
 
04:22:15.830 --> 04:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
significant increase in education
 
04:22:18.229 --> 04:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
funding in that budget alleviates some
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
of the need for this bill I'm trying to
 
04:22:22.670 --> 04:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
basically ask had you known at the
 
04:22:24.849 --> 04:22:24.859 align:start position:0%
beginning what the budget will have been
 
04:22:27.950 --> 04:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
would you you know would does this bill
 
04:22:32.990 --> 04:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:33.000 --> 04:22:36.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:22:36.229 --> 04:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:38.809 --> 04:22:38.819 align:start position:0%
um it's a good question I I really don't
 
04:22:41.269 --> 04:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
know because at the time I was working
 
04:22:43.550 --> 04:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
on that it was like I didn't know there
 
04:22:46.130 --> 04:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
would be anything else so we were in the
 
04:22:48.650 --> 04:22:48.660 align:start position:0%
same Darkness so you know everybody was
 
04:22:50.630 --> 04:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
there but I'm just asking because
 
04:22:50.640 --> 04:22:52.309 align:start position:0%
there but I'm just asking because
obviously

04:22:52.309 --> 04:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
04:22:55.550 --> 04:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
you know there is some there are
 
04:22:57.410 --> 04:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
significant increases already there that
 
04:22:58.729 --> 04:22:58.739 align:start position:0%
this bill would also add and I don't
 
04:23:01.070 --> 04:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
want to quote unquote double count it or
 
04:23:02.689 --> 04:23:02.699 align:start position:0%
you know and I want to understand the
 
04:23:04.490 --> 04:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
intent of your bill because maybe you
 
04:23:05.870 --> 04:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
know it was in 10 in one way or the
 
04:23:07.670 --> 04:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
other so I think if I were going to do
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
if I had known ahead of time I certainly
 
04:23:12.769 --> 04:23:12.779 align:start position:0%
would not have
 
04:23:16.189 --> 04:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
just wiped out what I presented because
 
04:23:19.250 --> 04:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
I think the advantage to that is it
 
04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
sends money to the towns that need it
 
04:23:23.150 --> 04:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
the most
 
04:23:26.330 --> 04:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
by increasing the per pupil spending
 
04:23:28.849 --> 04:23:28.859 align:start position:0%
you're making the same Contra even
 
04:23:31.849 --> 04:23:31.859 align:start position:0%
contribution across all school districts
 
04:23:34.370 --> 04:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
so I think that I probably would have
 
04:23:36.229 --> 04:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
gone for at least some kind of balance
 
04:23:39.530 --> 04:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
between the two I appreciate it I'm good
 
04:23:41.269 --> 04:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
Sally Sally could you just talk about
 
04:23:45.830 --> 04:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
fiscals disparity and what how that's
 
04:23:45.840 --> 04:23:46.910 align:start position:0%
fiscals disparity and what how that's
figured

04:23:46.910 --> 04:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
figured
 
04:23:50.269 --> 04:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
figured out to disperse
 
04:23:53.870 --> 04:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
um it's it's an equalized valuation per
 
04:23:53.880 --> 04:23:55.130 align:start position:0%
um it's it's an equalized valuation per
student

04:23:55.130 --> 04:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:23:55.140 --> 04:23:56.769 align:start position:0%
student
so

04:23:56.769 --> 04:23:56.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:00.110 --> 04:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
equalized evaluation is the fair market
 
04:24:03.110 --> 04:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
value of the property that's oh thank
 
04:24:05.030 --> 04:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
you for your market value of the
 
04:24:08.389 --> 04:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
property that's in the community
 
04:24:11.689 --> 04:24:11.699 align:start position:0%
and it's divided by the number of
 
04:24:14.170 --> 04:24:14.180 align:start position:0%
students that you have that that
 
04:24:18.410 --> 04:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
admr just a strict count of of students
 
04:24:21.410 --> 04:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
no weights for anything else
 
04:24:24.429 --> 04:24:24.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:28.610 --> 04:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
I think just
 
04:24:38.170 --> 04:24:38.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:40.910 --> 04:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
so there are so many different formulas
 
04:24:43.010 --> 04:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
and I have seen over the years I've seen
 
04:24:44.330 --> 04:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
a hundred more than a hundred different
 
04:24:47.210 --> 04:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
ones so it's equalized valuation per
 
04:24:49.130 --> 04:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
student and
 
04:24:51.530 --> 04:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
um so the towns that have the lowest
 
04:24:55.010 --> 04:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
property tax base get the most the most
 
04:24:57.469 --> 04:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
money for that so there's a huge
 
04:25:00.469 --> 04:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
disparity I you know some there are some
 
04:25:03.290 --> 04:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
towns that have
 
04:25:03.300 --> 04:25:05.170 align:start position:0%
towns that have
um

04:25:05.170 --> 04:25:05.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:08.269 --> 04:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
less what what is average is a little
 
04:25:11.750 --> 04:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
over a million dollars per student
 
04:25:13.729 --> 04:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
um that those are the figures that we've
 
04:25:16.189 --> 04:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
been using it doesn't figure in
 
04:25:18.830 --> 04:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
when we see the results of the property
 
04:25:21.530 --> 04:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
value increases because of covet it will
 
04:25:23.809 --> 04:25:23.819 align:start position:0%
actually be higher but there are some
 
04:25:26.809 --> 04:25:26.819 align:start position:0%
towns that only have like eight hundred
 
04:25:30.469 --> 04:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per student and why you
 
04:25:32.929 --> 04:25:32.939 align:start position:0%
use that measure is your thinking in
 
04:25:36.229 --> 04:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
terms of what can property taxpayers
 
04:25:39.349 --> 04:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
afford to pay because at the local level
 
04:25:41.210 --> 04:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
the only way they get money to support
 
04:25:42.889 --> 04:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
their schools is through the property
 
04:25:45.170 --> 04:25:45.180 align:start position:0%
tax well other than state aid and
 
04:25:47.090 --> 04:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
federal aid that's where they come up
 
04:25:48.290 --> 04:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
with their money
 
04:25:52.309 --> 04:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
to do that funding so some some towns
 
04:25:54.469 --> 04:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
they only have eight hundred thousand if
 
04:25:56.990 --> 04:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
you look in Rockingham County I don't
 
04:25:59.570 --> 04:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
know what the number is offhand but it's
 
04:26:01.250 --> 04:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
an awful lot higher than eight hundred
 
04:26:02.870 --> 04:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per student you know
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's probably
 
04:26:06.830 --> 04:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
you know could maybe it's like a 2
 
04:26:08.450 --> 04:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
million or something it's got to be a
 
04:26:12.290 --> 04:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
lot more than that and it's in the um
 
04:26:15.469 --> 04:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
those that property tax base to students
 
04:26:19.610 --> 04:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
per student is vastly different from one
 
04:26:22.790 --> 04:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
town to another all across the state you
 
04:26:24.889 --> 04:26:24.899 align:start position:0%
know they're you know you could have one
 
04:26:27.830 --> 04:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
town that that has you know three three
 
04:26:30.530 --> 04:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars per student the next one
 
04:26:33.610 --> 04:26:33.620 align:start position:0%
over may only have nine hundred thousand
 
04:26:36.530 --> 04:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
and you you then you have Waterville
 
04:26:38.030 --> 04:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
Valley which is not too far from my
 
04:26:40.610 --> 04:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
house it's something like 23 million
 
04:26:43.370 --> 04:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
dollars per student so it's vastly
 
04:26:43.380 --> 04:26:46.370 align:start position:0%
dollars per student so it's vastly
different

04:26:46.370 --> 04:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:49.070 --> 04:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
so the so the fiscal capacity disparity
 
04:26:50.630 --> 04:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
Aid doesn't give any money to Waterville
 
04:26:53.929 --> 04:26:53.939 align:start position:0%
Valley for sure and um focus is giving
 
04:26:55.670 --> 04:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
the most amount to those on the lower
 
04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
property value per student and
 
04:27:00.889 --> 04:27:00.899 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman you have a
 
04:27:03.590 --> 04:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
we know a number of students that get
 
04:27:08.170 --> 04:27:08.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:11.510 --> 04:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
so I think Mark knows if I had to take a
 
04:27:14.750 --> 04:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
guess I'd guess a hundred and sixty
 
04:27:18.349 --> 04:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
thousand how close uh that was last
 
04:27:20.090 --> 04:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
year's that's the latest number we have
 
04:27:22.370 --> 04:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
that's that's
 
04:27:25.670 --> 04:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
well in hb2 I'm looking at hb2 the
 
04:27:28.729 --> 04:27:28.739 align:start position:0%
governor on page 63 and the adequacy
 
04:27:31.149 --> 04:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
formula goes from
 
04:27:34.630 --> 04:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
697.77 to
 
04:27:39.469 --> 04:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
756.43 uh for each pupil in the 80th no
 
04:27:41.149 --> 04:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
that's English language Learners all
 
04:27:43.490 --> 04:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
right let's get to the right line here
 
04:27:45.649 --> 04:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
uh but the governor doesn't have any
 
04:27:48.410 --> 04:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
despair his is equal across the state
 
04:27:55.490 --> 04:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:57.590 --> 04:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for where he adds to the
 
04:27:59.809 --> 04:27:59.819 align:start position:0%
Texas free and reduced but I don't see
 
04:28:01.670 --> 04:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
it here
 
04:28:09.110 --> 04:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:09.120 --> 04:28:14.410 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:28:14.410 --> 04:28:14.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:17.269 --> 04:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
within your community so he's he's going
 
04:28:20.210 --> 04:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
up about 600 per student this bill goes
 
04:28:23.510 --> 04:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:23.520 --> 04:28:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
third

04:28:24.950 --> 04:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
third
 
04:28:31.429 --> 04:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:35.030 --> 04:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
so it's not yeah so so this bill 529
 
04:28:37.550 --> 04:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
it's on a sliding scale so the amount
 
04:28:40.010 --> 04:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
per student is different from one town
 
04:28:43.309 --> 04:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
to the next okay and it's also it's also
 
04:28:46.250 --> 04:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
you know smaller pot of money that's
 
04:28:47.630 --> 04:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
being spread but they're not doing
 
04:28:49.429 --> 04:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
anything with the money to help the
 
04:28:52.550 --> 04:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
student that's my problem the bill um it
 
04:28:54.530 --> 04:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the original bill but but
 
04:28:57.469 --> 04:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
House Ed put an amendment on the bill
 
04:29:00.710 --> 04:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
that requires like an accountability
 
04:29:04.130 --> 04:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
plan except for the ones that get just a
 
04:29:05.809 --> 04:29:05.819 align:start position:0%
little bit you know some of them don't
 
04:29:07.790 --> 04:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
get very if it's if they get like less
 
04:29:09.889 --> 04:29:09.899 align:start position:0%
than 50 000 they don't have to do a plan
 
04:29:12.349 --> 04:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
but if it's above 50 000 they have to do
 
04:29:15.769 --> 04:29:15.779 align:start position:0%
give the um Department a plan on how
 
04:29:21.410 --> 04:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:25.010 --> 04:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:27.110 --> 04:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
if anyone else want to contribute to
 
04:29:27.120 --> 04:29:28.010 align:start position:0%
if anyone else want to contribute to
this

04:29:28.010 --> 04:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:29:34.980 --> 04:29:34.990 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:34.990 --> 04:29:42.290 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:29:42.290 --> 04:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:42.300 --> 04:29:52.429 align:start position:0%
 
sure

04:29:52.429 --> 04:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:52.439 --> 04:29:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:29:53.510 --> 04:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:29:53.520 --> 04:29:54.170 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:29:54.170 --> 04:29:54.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:57.050 --> 04:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
one choose to make here yeah um thank
 
04:29:59.570 --> 04:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and members of the uh the
 
04:29:59.580 --> 04:30:00.769 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and members of the uh the
committee

04:30:00.769 --> 04:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:30:03.170 --> 04:30:03.180 align:start position:0%
um uh and thanks for your Indulgence
 
04:30:05.809 --> 04:30:05.819 align:start position:0%
during our executive session we're being
 
04:30:08.570 --> 04:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
held hostage by the chair
 
04:30:12.410 --> 04:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
but um but uh I I
 
04:30:15.410 --> 04:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
did not hear what representative fellows
 
04:30:18.170 --> 04:30:18.180 align:start position:0%
um said or what uh what any proceeding
 
04:30:18.180 --> 04:30:18.889 align:start position:0%
um said or what uh what any proceeding
um

04:30:18.889 --> 04:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:21.769 --> 04:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
um uh possibly Mr manchinello uh my
 
04:30:24.050 --> 04:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
understanding is I think he did prepare
 
04:30:29.929 --> 04:30:29.939 align:start position:0%
a fiscal uh report uh now on this that I
 
04:30:33.170 --> 04:30:33.180 align:start position:0%
think corresponds 100 with what um with
 
04:30:34.910 --> 04:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
what representative fellas had had
 
04:30:34.920 --> 04:30:36.710 align:start position:0%
what representative fellas had had
presented

04:30:36.710 --> 04:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
presented
 
04:30:41.929 --> 04:30:41.939 align:start position:0%
in education and um and I think as um as
 
04:30:44.090 --> 04:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh certainly
 
04:30:47.450 --> 04:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
know this uh uh 529 passed unanimously
 
04:30:51.110 --> 04:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
is that correct from um recommended OTP
 
04:30:53.510 --> 04:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
by the education committee past the
 
04:30:56.929 --> 04:30:56.939 align:start position:0%
floor on on a Voice vote and uh and I
 
04:30:59.990 --> 04:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
think is a a very strong
 
04:31:02.389 --> 04:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
um uh serves as a strong pillar of
 
04:31:05.389 --> 04:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
support for our most uh vulnerable
 
04:31:07.130 --> 04:31:07.140 align:start position:0%
school districts ones that have the
 
04:31:09.649 --> 04:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
lowest property valuations ones that
 
04:31:11.950 --> 04:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
have have the highest
 
04:31:15.769 --> 04:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
concentrations of of low-income families
 
04:31:19.790 --> 04:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh in the in their schools and uh and in
 
04:31:22.309 --> 04:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
in my opinion I think it pairs very well
 
04:31:24.950 --> 04:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
with uh with the governor's
 
04:31:24.960 --> 04:31:25.849 align:start position:0%
with uh with the governor's
um

04:31:25.849 --> 04:31:25.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:29.630 --> 04:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh modifications to the uh to the school
 
04:31:33.769 --> 04:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
funding formula and in particular does
 
04:31:36.830 --> 04:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
um provides important uh financial
 
04:31:38.570 --> 04:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
support like I said to the most
 
04:31:40.610 --> 04:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
challenged communities you know
 
04:31:42.649 --> 04:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
including communities like Berlin
 
04:31:46.670 --> 04:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield Newport Claremont
 
04:31:49.610 --> 04:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
um and uh and so forth so so communities
 
04:31:52.250 --> 04:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't necessarily see additional
 
04:31:55.250 --> 04:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
State funding through the increases in
 
04:31:57.170 --> 04:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
the base adequacy amount or the
 
04:31:59.649 --> 04:31:59.659 align:start position:0%
differential Aid factors but would lose
 
04:32:02.330 --> 04:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
significant funds through the
 
04:32:04.610 --> 04:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
elimination of stabilization which we I
 
04:32:07.550 --> 04:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
think all agree is something that we
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
need to um uh to address but but 529
 
04:32:14.510 --> 04:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
provides I think those those additional
 
04:32:17.630 --> 04:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
supports for those uh for those uh
 
04:32:17.640 --> 04:32:19.010 align:start position:0%
supports for those uh for those uh
communities

04:32:19.010 --> 04:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
communities
 
04:32:23.570 --> 04:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
question so thank you for let me ask him
 
04:32:26.389 --> 04:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
a question David Mr representative
 
04:32:26.399 --> 04:32:27.410 align:start position:0%
a question David Mr representative
lumino

04:32:27.410 --> 04:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
lumino
 
04:32:27.420 --> 04:32:29.349 align:start position:0%
lumino
um

04:32:29.349 --> 04:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:31.910 --> 04:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
and representative lad to both of you
 
04:32:36.110 --> 04:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
now we have the governor's proposal
 
04:32:38.570 --> 04:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
if you had your druthers what would you
 
04:32:40.849 --> 04:32:40.859 align:start position:0%
add to the governor's proposal in
 
04:32:43.189 --> 04:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
relation to 529
 
04:32:47.149 --> 04:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
and so what would the formula with what
 
04:32:49.250 --> 04:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
you are proposing look like in terms of
 
04:32:51.769 --> 04:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget
 
04:32:53.689 --> 04:32:53.699 align:start position:0%
so so I think that's a very good
 
04:32:57.290 --> 04:32:57.300 align:start position:0%
question I um I like the fact that that
 
04:33:00.610 --> 04:33:00.620 align:start position:0%
that the governor's proposal provides
 
04:33:03.889 --> 04:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
increases the um the factors associated
 
04:33:06.470 --> 04:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
with special educate cost factors
 
04:33:08.810 --> 04:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
associated with special education and
 
04:33:11.689 --> 04:33:11.699 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price lunch I think uh
 
04:33:14.689 --> 04:33:14.699 align:start position:0%
the governor also uh goes further and
 
04:33:17.689 --> 04:33:17.699 align:start position:0%
recognizes That Base adequacy which is
 
04:33:20.090 --> 04:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
basically the cost of the basket of
 
04:33:22.849 --> 04:33:22.859 align:start position:0%
goods that that constitutes an adequate
 
04:33:25.070 --> 04:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
education so we're talking about
 
04:33:27.109 --> 04:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
this is where I representative lad and I
 
04:33:28.730 --> 04:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
sometimes have just interesting
 
04:33:31.070 --> 04:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
discussions on this but it's a bag of
 
04:33:33.830 --> 04:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
stuff including 40 desks and a
 
04:33:36.349 --> 04:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
chalkboard and 1 500th of a principal
 
04:33:39.830 --> 04:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
and all the things that that that
 
04:33:42.949 --> 04:33:42.959 align:start position:0%
um uh historically have um have come to
 
04:33:44.869 --> 04:33:44.879 align:start position:0%
a cost total of about thirty nine
 
04:33:46.970 --> 04:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and I think the governor
 
04:33:49.070 --> 04:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
has has proposed increasing that
 
04:33:50.929 --> 04:33:50.939 align:start position:0%
substantially which is certainly
 
04:33:53.390 --> 04:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
justifiable given the what the real cost
 
04:33:56.750 --> 04:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
of that bag of stuff is but it doesn't
 
04:33:59.631 --> 04:33:59.641 align:start position:0%
really get you to um to to actually
 
04:34:02.449 --> 04:34:02.459 align:start position:0%
operating a school district in any any
 
04:34:05.689 --> 04:34:05.699 align:start position:0%
meaningful way and I think we've we've
 
04:34:08.810 --> 04:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
our committee has heard testimony from
 
04:34:11.990 --> 04:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
school districts including uh Berlin
 
04:34:15.349 --> 04:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
um mayor Grenier from Berlin has has
 
04:34:17.390 --> 04:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
testified we've heard from districts
 
04:34:20.449 --> 04:34:20.459 align:start position:0%
including Derry New Hampshire and um and
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
Newport have testified on that certainly
 
04:34:25.070 --> 04:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester has
 
04:34:28.730 --> 04:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
been and uh and uh and they just you
 
04:34:31.131 --> 04:34:31.141 align:start position:0%
know can't can't do can't provide an
 
04:34:34.070 --> 04:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
educational program for um for thirty
 
04:34:37.310 --> 04:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
nine hundred dollars uh uh but uh but I
 
04:34:39.230 --> 04:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
think the governor has recognized this
 
04:34:42.170 --> 04:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
recognize that bag of stuff those inputs
 
04:34:44.990 --> 04:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
cost more so I think that's a good good
 
04:34:48.650 --> 04:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
move I think the um where the where the
 
04:34:48.660 --> 04:34:49.429 align:start position:0%
move I think the um where the where the
um

04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:54.349 --> 04:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
where where I would have some and I want
 
04:34:56.269 --> 04:34:56.279 align:start position:0%
to be careful about calling it criticism
 
04:34:58.910 --> 04:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
because I I do support obviously
 
04:35:00.650 --> 04:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
um improving State funding and public
 
04:35:04.250 --> 04:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
education but when you increase base
 
04:35:06.769 --> 04:35:06.779 align:start position:0%
you're increasing it you're increasing
 
04:35:11.150 --> 04:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
the the state obligation to every school
 
04:35:13.010 --> 04:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
district whether or not you're the city
 
04:35:15.410 --> 04:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
of Manchester the city of Berlin or the
 
04:35:18.709 --> 04:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
town of Newcastle and and uh and I think
 
04:35:20.750 --> 04:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
this is where where some of the
 
04:35:24.230 --> 04:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh uh that uh that that
 
04:35:25.730 --> 04:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
came out of the school funding
 
04:35:27.470 --> 04:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
commission working with representative
 
04:35:30.051 --> 04:35:30.061 align:start position:0%
Ladd working with um with attorney
 
04:35:32.510 --> 04:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
ardenshire uh who's the governor's um
 
04:35:34.369 --> 04:35:34.379 align:start position:0%
appointment to that representative Heath
 
04:35:36.230 --> 04:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative Miler
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
um representative cascaden who's now in
 
04:35:41.330 --> 04:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
the education committee uh
 
04:35:44.090 --> 04:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
um would would would see that that that
 
04:35:47.090 --> 04:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
the state gets its biggest bang for its
 
04:35:50.631 --> 04:35:50.641 align:start position:0%
buck when it directs State funds to
 
04:35:53.750 --> 04:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
where they're needed most so so where a
 
04:35:56.090 --> 04:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
school district does not have access to
 
04:35:59.269 --> 04:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
the resources it needs to uh to offer
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
educational programming the state comes
 
04:36:04.010 --> 04:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
in and make sure that you've got access
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
to the resources you need and um and uh
 
04:36:09.949 --> 04:36:09.959 align:start position:0%
but but I think I'm also being a pragma
 
04:36:12.949 --> 04:36:12.959 align:start position:0%
being a pragmatist uh saying that I
 
04:36:14.570 --> 04:36:14.580 align:start position:0%
think the I think the governor's
 
04:36:17.990 --> 04:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
proposal is responsible uh given the
 
04:36:19.789 --> 04:36:19.799 align:start position:0%
fact that we've got two court cases
 
04:36:22.131 --> 04:36:22.141 align:start position:0%
which which really do need to be weighed
 
04:36:24.349 --> 04:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
in on by by the state supreme court
 
04:36:26.810 --> 04:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
before we're going to be able to move
 
04:36:28.849 --> 04:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
um meaningfully in in that direction
 
04:36:32.929 --> 04:36:32.939 align:start position:0%
both the Rand case with respect to um uh
 
04:36:35.810 --> 04:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
how how swept is State uh wide education
 
04:36:38.810 --> 04:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
property tax is organized and then the
 
04:36:40.131 --> 04:36:40.141 align:start position:0%
conval case
 
04:36:42.890 --> 04:36:42.900 align:start position:0%
which I think not not only will get into
 
04:36:46.010 --> 04:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
the um the what the cost of an adequate
 
04:36:48.769 --> 04:36:48.779 align:start position:0%
education is but also whether the
 
04:36:50.990 --> 04:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the Constitution is
 
04:36:53.150 --> 04:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
the first and last dollar
 
04:36:57.230 --> 04:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
um uh approach or or can the state and
 
04:37:00.369 --> 04:37:00.379 align:start position:0%
I'm using a term that I think had been
 
04:37:03.830 --> 04:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
is probably goes back 20 years but it
 
04:37:05.810 --> 04:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
used to be called targeting
 
04:37:08.330 --> 04:37:08.340 align:start position:0%
um State money and honestly it was a
 
04:37:09.949 --> 04:37:09.959 align:start position:0%
partisan issue back then I think
 
04:37:12.289 --> 04:37:12.299 align:start position:0%
Republicans supported targeting and
 
04:37:15.830 --> 04:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
Democrats um uh went the other way but
 
04:37:18.709 --> 04:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
as a Democrat I'm again working with
 
04:37:20.570 --> 04:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad representative Miler
 
04:37:24.170 --> 04:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
attorney Arden feel that that this
 
04:37:27.949 --> 04:37:27.959 align:start position:0%
approach of of targeting directing State
 
04:37:30.590 --> 04:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
money to where it's needed
 
04:37:34.010 --> 04:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
um is uh is is not only responsible but
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
it's uh not only responsible in terms of
 
04:37:38.570 --> 04:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
education but it's basically responsible
 
04:37:40.849 --> 04:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
too because it can be done with existing
 
04:37:42.590 --> 04:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources without substantial
 
04:37:45.349 --> 04:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
changes to existing Revenue sources and
 
04:37:48.051 --> 04:37:48.061 align:start position:0%
uh and provide
 
04:37:50.631 --> 04:37:50.641 align:start position:0%
um strong opportunities for students
 
04:37:53.150 --> 04:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
across the street State and taxpayer
 
04:37:53.160 --> 04:37:54.470 align:start position:0%
across the street State and taxpayer
fairness

04:37:54.470 --> 04:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
fairness
 
04:37:57.830 --> 04:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
um across the state as as well so but
 
04:38:00.349 --> 04:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
but but practically speaking starting
 
04:38:03.590 --> 04:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
with the governor's proposal uh I would
 
04:38:07.369 --> 04:38:07.379 align:start position:0%
I would offer and represent lad
 
04:38:09.709 --> 04:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
um probably speak to this that that that
 
04:38:11.150 --> 04:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
I think we could it could be
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
strengthened with with representative
 
04:38:16.209 --> 04:38:16.219 align:start position:0%
Ladd some uh proposal through House Bill
 
04:38:21.051 --> 04:38:21.061 align:start position:0%
540 440 540 540 on um on three
 
04:38:23.631 --> 04:38:23.641 align:start position:0%
categories of uh of special education
 
04:38:25.551 --> 04:38:25.561 align:start position:0%
Aid I think you heard that this morning
 
04:38:29.449 --> 04:38:29.459 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be a a a new
 
04:38:32.269 --> 04:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
Improvement uh to it and then and then
 
04:38:36.470 --> 04:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
have have 529 uh parallel you know right
 
04:38:39.109 --> 04:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
on top of uh the governor's uh plan
 
04:38:41.689 --> 04:38:41.699 align:start position:0%
providing that fiscal capacity disparity
 
04:38:44.150 --> 04:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
relief so David what you're saying is
 
04:38:46.551 --> 04:38:46.561 align:start position:0%
that we would take the percentage of
 
04:38:48.189 --> 04:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
Freedom reduce
 
04:38:52.609 --> 04:38:52.619 align:start position:0%
and fiscal capacity disparity and add
 
04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
those elements to the existing Governor
 
04:38:59.029 --> 04:38:59.039 align:start position:0%
the existing formula put forth by the
 
04:39:00.830 --> 04:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
governor and
 
04:39:04.189 --> 04:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
um that would then give us more Equity
 
04:39:07.010 --> 04:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
across the state in terms of those
 
04:39:08.810 --> 04:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
school districts like mine Manchester
 
04:39:12.709 --> 04:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
and Claremont and others they would be
 
04:39:15.890 --> 04:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
able to I don't want to say be winners
 
04:39:18.709 --> 04:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
in this but they would gain the dollars
 
04:39:21.051 --> 04:39:21.061 align:start position:0%
that could equalize learning
 
04:39:23.029 --> 04:39:23.039 align:start position:0%
opportunities for all students across
 
04:39:25.250 --> 04:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
our state yeah I think that's well put I
 
04:39:28.250 --> 04:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
think adding 529 makes everybody a
 
04:39:30.609 --> 04:39:30.619 align:start position:0%
winner in this because right now without
 
04:39:33.650 --> 04:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
529 Manchester gets the same as they did
 
04:39:35.631 --> 04:39:35.641 align:start position:0%
under do under current where Berlin gets
 
04:39:37.070 --> 04:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
the same as they do under current law
 
04:39:38.930 --> 04:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
basically any place that has
 
04:39:41.690 --> 04:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
stabilization that would lose it
 
04:39:43.850 --> 04:39:43.860 align:start position:0%
um the governor's hold harmless comes in
 
04:39:48.110 --> 04:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
to hold them to fy24 current law 529
 
04:39:50.750 --> 04:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
goes goat would take them beyond that
 
04:39:53.510 --> 04:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
and provide them with with the the
 
04:39:53.520 --> 04:39:54.890 align:start position:0%
and provide them with with the the
relief

04:39:54.890 --> 04:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
relief
 
04:39:56.810 --> 04:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
um uh that they've that they've asked
 
04:39:59.448 --> 04:39:59.458 align:start position:0%
for that could be done in terms of I
 
04:40:02.570 --> 04:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
mean it could be used to um to to help
 
04:40:05.868 --> 04:40:05.878 align:start position:0%
provide a school budget that that meets
 
04:40:07.368 --> 04:40:07.378 align:start position:0%
the needs of the students and families
 
04:40:09.830 --> 04:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
but it could also provide the tax relief
 
04:40:12.410 --> 04:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
that that so many communities need as
 
04:40:12.420 --> 04:40:15.288 align:start position:0%
that that so many communities need as
well

04:40:15.288 --> 04:40:15.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:19.910 --> 04:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
so this is additive then add 529 would
 
04:40:22.150 --> 04:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
be in addition to the governor's
 
04:40:25.970 --> 04:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
proposal and and in addition to
 
04:40:30.288 --> 04:40:30.298 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd's uh house bill 540.
 
04:40:30.298 --> 04:40:32.270 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd's uh house bill 540.
representative

04:40:32.270 --> 04:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:40:33.948 --> 04:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much for the record
 
04:40:35.570 --> 04:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
Rick Ladd from Haverhill New Hampshire
 
04:40:39.288 --> 04:40:39.298 align:start position:0%
I'm one of those communities which is
 
04:40:41.150 --> 04:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
um not doing well in terms of Education
 
04:40:41.160 --> 04:40:42.650 align:start position:0%
um not doing well in terms of Education
funding

04:40:42.650 --> 04:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:40:46.490 --> 04:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
I have uh served on both the task force
 
04:40:48.170 --> 04:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
of the gov the commission which we had a
 
04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
year and a half ago I was one that was
 
04:40:53.868 --> 04:40:53.878 align:start position:0%
not supported the recommendations as a
 
04:40:58.610 --> 04:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
whole but I also recognize the need for
 
04:41:02.090 --> 04:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
assisting these districts uh the reason
 
04:41:03.830 --> 04:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
why I wasn't supportive of initially
 
04:41:05.750 --> 04:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
because was the way we looked at base
 
04:41:08.448 --> 04:41:08.458 align:start position:0%
adequacy I look at those things those
 
04:41:12.470 --> 04:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
inputs as absolutely necessary to Define
 
04:41:14.868 --> 04:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
what our base adequacy is rather than
 
04:41:16.730 --> 04:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
just taking some number out of the doe
 
04:41:18.170 --> 04:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
25 form
 
04:41:20.510 --> 04:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
and saying well that's the average cost
 
04:41:23.390 --> 04:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
of a student and yes it is maybe but
 
04:41:24.770 --> 04:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
it's also including things like
 
04:41:26.810 --> 04:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
Athletics and everything else and I want
 
04:41:28.490 --> 04:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
to only conclude those things required
 
04:41:30.050 --> 04:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity for an adequate
 
04:41:33.770 --> 04:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
education an academic education so I
 
04:41:36.530 --> 04:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
guess where I'm coming from and I do
 
04:41:38.330 --> 04:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
appreciate what the governor's doing as
 
04:41:40.610 --> 04:41:40.620 align:start position:0%
does represent luno here
 
04:41:40.620 --> 04:41:41.510 align:start position:0%
does represent luno here
um

04:41:41.510 --> 04:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:44.030 --> 04:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's important to look at this whole
 
04:41:47.208 --> 04:41:47.218 align:start position:0%
formula going from left to right
 
04:41:49.010 --> 04:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
and when you're looking at the left hand
 
04:41:50.990 --> 04:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
side of the center base adequacy right
 
04:41:51.000 --> 04:41:51.770 align:start position:0%
side of the center base adequacy right
now

04:41:51.770 --> 04:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:41:54.470 --> 04:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
when you put money in there
 
04:41:56.628 --> 04:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
you're putting money into the base
 
04:41:59.448 --> 04:41:59.458 align:start position:0%
adequacy which in some cases some
 
04:42:02.930 --> 04:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
districts are doing quite well right now
 
04:42:04.550 --> 04:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
whereas you look further to the right
 
04:42:06.350 --> 04:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
and you get past you know the
 
04:42:08.270 --> 04:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid
 
04:42:10.250 --> 04:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
and you see those towns which really
 
04:42:12.170 --> 04:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
need all that money to help even come up
 
04:42:14.690 --> 04:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
to the level of adequacy that to the
 
04:42:16.610 --> 04:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
level of money that comes in this site
 
04:42:19.910 --> 04:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
from the swept and they're not there so
 
04:42:21.890 --> 04:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
we have to have things such as relief
 
04:42:24.650 --> 04:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
grants extraordinary needs grants and
 
04:42:26.510 --> 04:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
I'm looking back at what we recommended
 
04:42:30.110 --> 04:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
in 2018 under the umberger study and we
 
04:42:32.930 --> 04:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
saw that there was necessary there is a
 
04:42:35.690 --> 04:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
need to address these towns where there
 
04:42:37.670 --> 04:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
is a definite relationship between
 
04:42:40.730 --> 04:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
performance academic performance and
 
04:42:42.230 --> 04:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
what they were receiving from the state
 
04:42:44.930 --> 04:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
in terms of support and funding
 
04:42:47.510 --> 04:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
and so we got to boost these communities
 
04:42:49.970 --> 04:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
up and I look back at what we had back
 
04:42:53.690 --> 04:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
in 2008 nine when Senator Estabrook had
 
04:42:57.230 --> 04:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
that study and fiscal capacity disparity
 
04:43:00.890 --> 04:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
Aid was a key factor to that in fact at
 
04:43:03.770 --> 04:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
that time our hold harmless was only 27
 
04:43:06.170 --> 04:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
million dollars but now we're looking at
 
04:43:09.230 --> 04:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
something that's roughly 156 157 million
 
04:43:11.150 --> 04:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
dollars that means this formula is
 
04:43:11.160 --> 04:43:12.050 align:start position:0%
dollars that means this formula is
broken

04:43:12.050 --> 04:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
broken
 
04:43:14.330 --> 04:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
and we're funding students as
 
04:43:16.010 --> 04:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
represented a while or oftentimes say
 
04:43:18.410 --> 04:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
and maybe the ghost kid because we're a
 
04:43:20.330 --> 04:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
demographic is shrinking significantly
 
04:43:23.150 --> 04:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
but with that there's still costs
 
04:43:25.910 --> 04:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
that these smaller districts have to pay
 
04:43:27.708 --> 04:43:27.718 align:start position:0%
for they're going to have to pay for
 
04:43:29.810 --> 04:43:29.820 align:start position:0%
everything from K through 12 and
 
04:43:31.788 --> 04:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
programs that we as a state have
 
04:43:33.530 --> 04:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
required them to have
 
04:43:36.170 --> 04:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
and they are it's much more costly if
 
04:43:37.788 --> 04:43:37.798 align:start position:0%
you look even at the community college
 
04:43:40.070 --> 04:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
system to run a course up at White
 
04:43:41.868 --> 04:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
Mountain Community College opposed to
 
04:43:43.730 --> 04:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
what they they have here at nhti where
 
04:43:45.590 --> 04:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
they have the student population per
 
04:43:48.050 --> 04:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
pupil wise it's more expensive at White
 
04:43:50.150 --> 04:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
Mountain Community College the same
 
04:43:51.948 --> 04:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
thing in these rural districts
 
04:43:54.650 --> 04:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
and so with that in order to provide the
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity for AP courses or those
 
04:43:59.330 --> 04:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
courses which are necessary
 
04:44:01.250 --> 04:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
for our students to receive that level
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
of Education we're going to have to put
 
04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity as Spirit Aid in there I
 
04:44:07.610 --> 04:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
don't know if I'd put quite as much into
 
04:44:10.368 --> 04:44:10.378 align:start position:0%
the base adequacy as slide some of that
 
04:44:13.368 --> 04:44:13.378 align:start position:0%
into where it better supports the state
 
04:44:15.170 --> 04:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
04:44:15.180 --> 04:44:15.890 align:start position:0%
as a whole
um

04:44:15.890 --> 04:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:18.590 --> 04:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion I think that what the
 
04:44:20.448 --> 04:44:20.458 align:start position:0%
finance committee has to look at how
 
04:44:21.530 --> 04:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
many of these areas we're going to have
 
04:44:23.090 --> 04:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
relief grants extraordinary grants
 
04:44:25.490 --> 04:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity it's time to consolidate
 
04:44:28.010 --> 04:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
some of that and build it around medium
 
04:44:29.810 --> 04:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
family incline Equis property evaluation
 
04:44:32.330 --> 04:44:32.340 align:start position:0%
per pupil and the physical capacity
 
04:44:34.670 --> 04:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
needs of those communities as was
 
04:44:37.128 --> 04:44:37.138 align:start position:0%
established back in Senator estabrook's
 
04:44:37.138 --> 04:44:38.090 align:start position:0%
established back in Senator estabrook's
day

04:44:38.090 --> 04:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:44:40.670 --> 04:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
going from ogenbluck to that formula to
 
04:44:43.128 --> 04:44:43.138 align:start position:0%
where we are now is we've had change
 
04:44:47.090 --> 04:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
quite often and quite often it's been
 
04:44:49.610 --> 04:44:49.620 align:start position:0%
unfortunate discussions between donor
 
04:44:50.990 --> 04:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
and non-donor
 
04:44:54.650 --> 04:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
and discussions where the students that
 
04:44:56.150 --> 04:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
are in these smaller districts are never
 
04:44:58.250 --> 04:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
the winners as I drove by I think I
 
04:45:00.708 --> 04:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned this morning how Piermont is
 
04:45:03.050 --> 04:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
looking at a 22 percent budget increase
 
04:45:05.570 --> 04:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
this last year due to special education
 
04:45:07.368 --> 04:45:07.378 align:start position:0%
needs but not just special education
 
04:45:09.830 --> 04:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
needs inflationary needs and costs doing
 
04:45:11.868 --> 04:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
business same thing in Warren another
 
04:45:14.750 --> 04:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
town which I have a Haverhill same deal
 
04:45:16.670 --> 04:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
we're like the you know the Charlestown
 
04:45:18.530 --> 04:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
we're like the Berlin we're like you
 
04:45:20.690 --> 04:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
know all those can be Franklin's of the
 
04:45:23.570 --> 04:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
world Newports where it's very difficult
 
04:45:25.730 --> 04:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
to offer what you in our district as
 
04:45:27.708 --> 04:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
what supposed drinks next door within a
 
04:45:29.570 --> 04:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
budding Community which has the ability
 
04:45:33.230 --> 04:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
to provide those services so I would
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
look at fiscal capacity just buried Aid
 
04:45:38.030 --> 04:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
in some form or fashion to send the
 
04:45:39.708 --> 04:45:39.718 align:start position:0%
money where it's going to do the
 
04:45:42.650 --> 04:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
greatest good and right now pumping a
 
04:45:45.350 --> 04:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
huge amount into the right left hand
 
04:45:48.170 --> 04:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
side of that column may not be what my
 
04:45:50.570 --> 04:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
first choice is my first choice would be
 
04:45:52.010 --> 04:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
slide that my money over to the right
 
04:45:54.230 --> 04:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
side somehow I realized that the base
 
04:45:56.270 --> 04:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
adequacy and Claremont and Londonderry
 
04:45:58.368 --> 04:45:58.378 align:start position:0%
we have to provide the same type of
 
04:46:00.110 --> 04:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity for wealthy communities as
 
04:46:01.970 --> 04:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
poor communities I get it
 
04:46:04.850 --> 04:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
but in order to do that and it's been
 
04:46:07.128 --> 04:46:07.138 align:start position:0%
the same every year I've been here we
 
04:46:08.930 --> 04:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
have to be looking at what's on the
 
04:46:11.930 --> 04:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
right hand side of that column and uh I
 
04:46:13.610 --> 04:46:13.620 align:start position:0%
I think we have an opportunity to do it
 
04:46:16.070 --> 04:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
this year and uh
 
04:46:17.990 --> 04:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
well there's a lot more to this equation
 
04:46:20.990 --> 04:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
and what we're and that's not on this
 
04:46:23.330 --> 04:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
particular bill right here so I'll leave
 
04:46:25.910 --> 04:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
it at that I think I'm echoing some of
 
04:46:28.430 --> 04:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
what representative luno has said
 
04:46:30.650 --> 04:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I'm echoing a little bit
 
04:46:32.330 --> 04:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
more to put more on the right hand side
 
04:46:34.010 --> 04:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
than the left hand side
 
04:46:36.050 --> 04:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:46:36.060 --> 04:46:37.490 align:start position:0%
thank you
questions

04:46:37.490 --> 04:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:46:39.230 --> 04:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you again
 
04:46:41.570 --> 04:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
for finding the time to come over I know
 
04:46:43.010 --> 04:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
it is a busy day
 
04:46:45.830 --> 04:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to you know I hear what
 
04:46:47.448 --> 04:46:47.458 align:start position:0%
you're saying about you know you want to
 
04:46:49.070 --> 04:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
move more money from the left-hand side
 
04:46:51.230 --> 04:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
where it goes more or less evenly to the
 
04:46:53.810 --> 04:46:53.820 align:start position:0%
right hand side what is distributed
 
04:46:56.030 --> 04:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
you know according to the needs of the
 
04:46:56.040 --> 04:46:57.430 align:start position:0%
you know according to the needs of the
community

04:46:57.430 --> 04:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:47:00.530 --> 04:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
at which point
 
04:47:03.650 --> 04:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
do we call it balanced because the way I
 
04:47:05.868 --> 04:47:05.878 align:start position:0%
look at it you know communities
 
04:47:08.510 --> 04:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
that have you know higher tax base also
 
04:47:10.610 --> 04:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
tend to have higher costs in every other
 
04:47:12.948 --> 04:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
way I mean building a building in uh you
 
04:47:12.958 --> 04:47:13.550 align:start position:0%
way I mean building a building in uh you
know

04:47:13.550 --> 04:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:47:15.650 --> 04:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
building a school in Windham will always
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
cost more than building you know the
 
04:47:19.850 --> 04:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
same school in a place where land is
 
04:47:23.510 --> 04:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
cheaper and so on and so forth so how
 
04:47:25.550 --> 04:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
what is the end goal I mean if if you
 
04:47:27.530 --> 04:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
had to redesign this from scratch how
 
04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
flat would it be in terms of the outcome
 
04:47:32.150 --> 04:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know how much should
 
04:47:34.128 --> 04:47:34.138 align:start position:0%
we balance it and how much should we
 
04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
recognize that some communities just
 
04:47:38.090 --> 04:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
need to you know have a higher tax base
 
04:47:40.850 --> 04:47:40.860 align:start position:0%
but also need to spend more to provide
 
04:47:43.490 --> 04:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
the same level of Education
 
04:47:45.230 --> 04:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand you know
 
04:47:47.090 --> 04:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
because you're saying we should move
 
04:47:51.170 --> 04:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
this move in this direction how far you
 
04:47:52.850 --> 04:47:52.860 align:start position:0%
know I think there are a lot of
 
04:47:55.910 --> 04:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
variables that get you to that area we
 
04:47:59.270 --> 04:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
want to be at some are non-money issues
 
04:48:01.970 --> 04:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
some are like quality of the staff the
 
04:48:03.948 --> 04:48:03.958 align:start position:0%
attitude of the teachers the attitude of
 
04:48:05.330 --> 04:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
the administration the building the
 
04:48:07.550 --> 04:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
leadership the supervision attitude of
 
04:48:09.890 --> 04:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
the community aspiration of the family
 
04:48:12.770 --> 04:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
the parents all those are issues which
 
04:48:15.530 --> 04:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
are non-money issues
 
04:48:18.650 --> 04:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
however we do know that it takes money
 
04:48:20.628 --> 04:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
to have a chemistry lab
 
04:48:22.730 --> 04:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
and many of these smaller schools don't
 
04:48:25.368 --> 04:48:25.378 align:start position:0%
have that opportunity yet we are
 
04:48:26.930 --> 04:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
expecting them to come out be prepared
 
04:48:28.610 --> 04:48:28.620 align:start position:0%
to go to the next level of Niche
 
04:48:31.670 --> 04:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education and so to
 
04:48:33.590 --> 04:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
provide the opportunity for an adequate
 
04:48:35.750 --> 04:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
education we're going to have to ensure
 
04:48:37.970 --> 04:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
that we are providing those services
 
04:48:40.970 --> 04:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
that we require them to have in those
 
04:48:43.788 --> 04:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
schools I don't believe some of the
 
04:48:45.770 --> 04:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
poorer communities have that happening
 
04:48:47.330 --> 04:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
right now in fact when I met with the
 
04:48:49.128 --> 04:48:49.138 align:start position:0%
principal in the building last night
 
04:48:51.410 --> 04:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
from about five o'clock to seven o'clock
 
04:48:53.330 --> 04:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
at night out in Warren
 
04:48:55.970 --> 04:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
he was telling me how they are having to
 
04:48:57.770 --> 04:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
do some extraordinary things just to
 
04:49:02.448 --> 04:49:02.458 align:start position:0%
find the revenue to accomplish uh some
 
04:49:03.830 --> 04:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
of their end goals and they're even
 
04:49:05.750 --> 04:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
looking at maybe we need to consolidate
 
04:49:07.910 --> 04:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
this school with the Wentworth Village
 
04:49:10.190 --> 04:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
School which is a mile apart and we can
 
04:49:11.810 --> 04:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
share instructions say they're looking
 
04:49:13.850 --> 04:49:13.860 align:start position:0%
all these cost saving measures but
 
04:49:15.770 --> 04:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
they're still not coming up to where
 
04:49:17.990 --> 04:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
they need to be they're not competitive
 
04:49:20.810 --> 04:49:20.820 align:start position:0%
and and us with that I would suggest
 
04:49:23.930 --> 04:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
that we look at what these the dollars
 
04:49:25.788 --> 04:49:25.798 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal capacity disparity Aid
 
04:49:28.910 --> 04:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
that we once had and look at why did we
 
04:49:31.010 --> 04:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
have that what did that committee back
 
04:49:34.550 --> 04:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
in 2008 and 2009 do to recognize that
 
04:49:36.708 --> 04:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
this is an absolute necessary thing we
 
04:49:38.390 --> 04:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
didn't have all that stabilization we
 
04:49:39.708 --> 04:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
have right now
 
04:49:42.410 --> 04:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
that was taken out of that area taken
 
04:49:44.628 --> 04:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
out a special ed and thrown into this
 
04:49:47.810 --> 04:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
area here that we have stabilization we
 
04:49:49.730 --> 04:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
put caps on it the Caps didn't work that
 
04:49:51.110 --> 04:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
ended up with a lawsuit in the southern
 
04:49:53.390 --> 04:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
part of the state uh we dropped down
 
04:49:56.330 --> 04:49:56.340 align:start position:0%
four percent each year that didn't work
 
04:49:59.330 --> 04:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
you know so where are we well we know we
 
04:50:00.948 --> 04:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
got to fund more to these School
 
04:50:04.070 --> 04:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
District how much I I I can't give you a
 
04:50:06.770 --> 04:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
magic figure on that I think none of us
 
04:50:08.930 --> 04:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
can do that but we do know that you know
 
04:50:10.550 --> 04:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
when I talk to Super in the schools up
 
04:50:13.730 --> 04:50:13.740 align:start position:0%
in SAU 23 she said I cannot be
 
04:50:13.740 --> 04:50:14.930 align:start position:0%
in SAU 23 she said I cannot be
competitive

04:50:14.930 --> 04:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
with the level of salary being offered
 
04:50:20.510 --> 04:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
to people down the river in Lime in
 
04:50:23.030 --> 04:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and Hanover we have wonderful
 
04:50:25.430 --> 04:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
art teacher boom two years later the
 
04:50:28.430 --> 04:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
teacher's working for Hanover so the
 
04:50:31.310 --> 04:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
consistency of program is not there uh
 
04:50:32.990 --> 04:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
we need to help out a little bit in that
 
04:50:34.610 --> 04:50:34.620 align:start position:0%
area and that's one where we could put
 
04:50:36.770 --> 04:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
it I appreciate it I mean it's a high
 
04:50:39.230 --> 04:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
it's a highly complex topic no question
 
04:50:41.090 --> 04:50:41.100 align:start position:0%
about it and obviously this being the
 
04:50:42.708 --> 04:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
finance committee we tend to focus on
 
04:50:44.208 --> 04:50:44.218 align:start position:0%
the money because all the other things
 
04:50:45.890 --> 04:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
are more of a local control local
 
04:50:47.690 --> 04:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
scoreboard type issues in terms of
 
04:50:50.090 --> 04:50:50.100 align:start position:0%
culture and non-monetary things
 
04:50:52.970 --> 04:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
all I want to do is point out that
 
04:50:52.980 --> 04:50:54.708 align:start position:0%
all I want to do is point out that
really

04:50:54.708 --> 04:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:50:57.288 --> 04:50:57.298 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we cannot go all
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
the way to equal funding because that
 
04:51:02.390 --> 04:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
would not recognize the different needs
 
04:51:04.490 --> 04:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
of every Community too so it's it's just
 
04:51:07.010 --> 04:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
a complex topic that I think we have to
 
04:51:08.570 --> 04:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
keep striving to find the balance
 
04:51:10.128 --> 04:51:10.138 align:start position:0%
there's a cultural needs in every
 
04:51:11.690 --> 04:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
community and every Community is
 
04:51:13.250 --> 04:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
different and we're not going to have
 
04:51:16.670 --> 04:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
all people the same I got it uh however
 
04:51:19.010 --> 04:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
if we're going to be asking our schools
 
04:51:22.010 --> 04:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
to prepare kids at a certain level then
 
04:51:23.330 --> 04:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to fund them to do
 
04:51:23.340 --> 04:51:24.230 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to fund them to do
that

04:51:24.230 --> 04:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:51:26.990 --> 04:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
reasonably yes thank you yeah can I add
 
04:51:29.810 --> 04:51:29.820 align:start position:0%
on to that just very very quickly so so
 
04:51:32.628 --> 04:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
I and I think it's a very good question
 
04:51:35.150 --> 04:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
um about how do you go about balancing
 
04:51:37.310 --> 04:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
you know this the the
 
04:51:39.350 --> 04:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
04:51:42.590 --> 04:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
how to fund how the state should use its
 
04:51:45.530 --> 04:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
precious resources when when funding
 
04:51:47.390 --> 04:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
schools across the state do you fund all
 
04:51:50.150 --> 04:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
the schools as you you just said or uh
 
04:51:53.330 --> 04:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
or do you do you do you not do that and
 
04:51:55.128 --> 04:51:55.138 align:start position:0%
um and you know I think we're sort of
 
04:51:56.868 --> 04:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
we're sort of doing it both ways right
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
now we've got the interpretation that
 
04:52:00.830 --> 04:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd said
 
04:52:03.470 --> 04:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
that um that the state is responsible
 
04:52:06.170 --> 04:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
for the first and last dollar of funding
 
04:52:09.170 --> 04:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
an adequate education in all uh in all
 
04:52:11.448 --> 04:52:11.458 align:start position:0%
uh for all school districts but at the
 
04:52:14.448 --> 04:52:14.458 align:start position:0%
same time the first the the first those
 
04:52:17.208 --> 04:52:17.218 align:start position:0%
first dollars actually come from swept
 
04:52:21.170 --> 04:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
in all of these districts and for about
 
04:52:23.930 --> 04:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
um 30-ish or so of those of these
 
04:52:25.310 --> 04:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
districts including some that are
 
04:52:27.230 --> 04:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
represented by people around the table
 
04:52:29.750 --> 04:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh this afternoon uh they don't receive
 
04:52:31.010 --> 04:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
any direct
 
04:52:34.070 --> 04:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
um uh funding from the state they they
 
04:52:35.810 --> 04:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
have their state property tax and they
 
04:52:39.230 --> 04:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
don't receive any more so that's
 
04:52:42.650 --> 04:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
essentially providing a um a means
 
04:52:45.770 --> 04:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
threshold saying if you can pay for it
 
04:52:48.770 --> 04:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
with this then then you're good if you
 
04:52:50.750 --> 04:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
can't pay for it with this
 
04:52:53.330 --> 04:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
Haverhill Hopkinton so many other
 
04:52:56.090 --> 04:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
districts across the state the state's
 
04:52:58.550 --> 04:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
coming in uh to make sure that you can
 
04:53:01.788 --> 04:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
get to um to get to that adequacy number
 
04:53:04.128 --> 04:53:04.138 align:start position:0%
so so you know what the governor's doing
 
04:53:07.010 --> 04:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
in raising that adequacy number uh I
 
04:53:10.850 --> 04:53:10.860 align:start position:0%
think is is is responsible in in in that
 
04:53:13.850 --> 04:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
way uh but uh but I think it's it's
 
04:53:17.510 --> 04:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
going to be a question that that as as
 
04:53:21.530 --> 04:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court you know it comes down
 
04:53:24.590 --> 04:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
on on the Rand case and on the conval
 
04:53:27.110 --> 04:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
case how does the state go about doing
 
04:53:28.610 --> 04:53:28.620 align:start position:0%
that I think what the governor's
 
04:53:32.270 --> 04:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
proposing here plus 529 is a terrific
 
04:53:35.330 --> 04:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
interim step
 
04:53:36.650 --> 04:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know when we're going to
 
04:53:39.410 --> 04:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
hear back from from the the New
 
04:53:41.030 --> 04:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court but probably
 
04:53:44.030 --> 04:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
over the next couple years and um and
 
04:53:45.470 --> 04:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
and I think it will provide the
 
04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
legislature with another opportunity to
 
04:53:51.050 --> 04:53:51.060 align:start position:0%
hopefully revisit a school funding
 
04:53:53.448 --> 04:53:53.458 align:start position:0%
formula that does not have stabilization
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
that does not have all these you know
 
04:53:58.970 --> 04:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
things that work outside of the formula
 
04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh in which to uh to hold it up that we
 
04:54:04.128 --> 04:54:04.138 align:start position:0%
can actually develop a strong school
 
04:54:06.230 --> 04:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
funding formula that works for the
 
04:54:08.628 --> 04:54:08.638 align:start position:0%
students and the taxpayers you know
 
04:54:11.810 --> 04:54:11.820 align:start position:0%
across um across the state independent
 
04:54:14.930 --> 04:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
of things like stabilization and and
 
04:54:17.750 --> 04:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
stuff like that thank you
 
04:54:20.150 --> 04:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
for the question Joe yeah thank you Mr
 
04:54:23.030 --> 04:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for being here uh
 
04:54:25.490 --> 04:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
where do you propose I figure this is
 
04:54:28.610 --> 04:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
going to cost about 41 million dollars
 
04:54:30.230 --> 04:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
what do you propose this money is coming
 
04:54:30.240 --> 04:54:31.788 align:start position:0%
what do you propose this money is coming
from

04:54:31.788 --> 04:54:31.798 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:54:34.128 --> 04:54:34.138 align:start position:0%
so um what what's going to cost 41
 
04:54:36.890 --> 04:54:36.900 align:start position:0%
million dollars yes 529.
 
04:54:44.530 --> 04:54:44.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:46.850 --> 04:54:46.860 align:start position:0%
the governor's formula I think
 
04:54:48.288 --> 04:54:48.298 align:start position:0%
representative Bellows is I think she
 
04:54:50.570 --> 04:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
came up with 39 million okay 36 million
 
04:54:53.810 --> 04:54:53.820 align:start position:0%
but yes well if you what I did I took
 
04:54:56.390 --> 04:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
the governor's whole harness column uh
 
04:54:59.930 --> 04:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
total state aid and the current RSA plus
 
04:55:04.330 --> 04:55:04.340 align:start position:0%
529 okay and the difference is 41 260
 
04:55:06.770 --> 04:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
245 so
 
04:55:10.610 --> 04:55:10.620 align:start position:0%
that's now I know we you know we
 
04:55:13.550 --> 04:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
supplemented the swept uh just and
 
04:55:16.310 --> 04:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
basically that was it ended up just
 
04:55:19.250 --> 04:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
supplementing the uh property tax you
 
04:55:22.368 --> 04:55:22.378 align:start position:0%
know for each what at about 27 yeah
 
04:55:24.970 --> 04:55:24.980 align:start position:0%
which is 100 million versus the price
 
04:55:27.110 --> 04:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
363 so
 
04:55:30.708 --> 04:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
but that that that people pay our
 
04:55:33.230 --> 04:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
districts paid that money and it was
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
just something back in yeah so represent
 
04:55:37.490 --> 04:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
Petrie I think that's I think it's a
 
04:55:40.250 --> 04:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
very good question and and obviously you
 
04:55:41.690 --> 04:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
know the budget process is about
 
04:55:45.530 --> 04:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
priorities and um and I guess the first
 
04:55:47.990 --> 04:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
thing that I that I put out there is
 
04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
that this money is already being being
 
04:55:52.850 --> 04:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
paid for it's being paid for by local
 
04:55:56.390 --> 04:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers so it's already there
 
04:55:58.670 --> 04:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
these local properties are all of our
 
04:56:00.708 --> 04:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
constituents and I'm sure we hear from
 
04:56:03.530 --> 04:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
all of them uh or certainly many of them
 
04:56:05.628 --> 04:56:05.638 align:start position:0%
that represent a very similar
 
04:56:07.190 --> 04:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
um you know position what are you doing
 
04:56:08.750 --> 04:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
about my property taxes what are you
 
04:56:10.730 --> 04:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
doing about school funding
 
04:56:13.368 --> 04:56:13.378 align:start position:0%
um so so it's already being paid for
 
04:56:16.190 --> 04:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
through local property taxes
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
um with very different rates and and you
 
04:56:22.190 --> 04:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
know the the person in a the family in a
 
04:56:25.550 --> 04:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
in a um uh you know in a four hundred
 
04:56:27.948 --> 04:56:27.958 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar home in Claremont is
 
04:56:29.570 --> 04:56:29.580 align:start position:0%
paying about the same amount of real
 
04:56:31.490 --> 04:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
property taxes as somebody in a four
 
04:56:34.190 --> 04:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
million dollar home in Newcastle so so
 
04:56:36.650 --> 04:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
it's all being paid for but at very very
 
04:56:40.610 --> 04:56:40.620 align:start position:0%
different rates the um uh so so it all
 
04:56:43.490 --> 04:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
comes down to priorities and and you
 
04:56:45.050 --> 04:56:45.060 align:start position:0%
know we've we've got the the
 
04:56:48.230 --> 04:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner I believe has has proposed
 
04:56:50.990 --> 04:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
60 million dollars to uh to go to
 
04:56:53.090 --> 04:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts what's the
 
04:56:57.050 --> 04:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
priority is the priority 165 000
 
04:57:00.230 --> 04:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
um public school kids and their families
 
04:57:01.910 --> 04:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
and all the taxpayers that are
 
04:57:04.730 --> 04:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
supporting them or is it the 3200
 
04:57:07.670 --> 04:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh students with um with EFA accounts
 
04:57:09.650 --> 04:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
only about a hundred of which actually
 
04:57:11.990 --> 04:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
exited their Public Schools
 
04:57:13.730 --> 04:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
um you know because of the existence of
 
04:57:15.890 --> 04:57:15.900 align:start position:0%
of the program you know I think it's
 
04:57:18.288 --> 04:57:18.298 align:start position:0%
gonna and that's just one obviously one
 
04:57:20.628 --> 04:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
example of where the money could come
 
04:57:22.670 --> 04:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
from I think representative Ladd maybe
 
04:57:24.470 --> 04:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
suggested shifting some from the left
 
04:57:26.448 --> 04:57:26.458 align:start position:0%
side to the right side
 
04:57:27.890 --> 04:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
um and I don't want to you know I don't
 
04:57:29.448 --> 04:57:29.458 align:start position:0%
want to get in I don't want to make this
 
04:57:32.930 --> 04:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
a battle with uh with with efas but it
 
04:57:35.448 --> 04:57:35.458 align:start position:0%
certainly no no and I yeah I'm not
 
04:57:37.970 --> 04:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
trying to uh to do that but it could
 
04:57:41.330 --> 04:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
become come out of base base adequacy
 
04:57:45.730 --> 04:57:45.740 align:start position:0%
not go to the level the governor did yes
 
04:57:52.070 --> 04:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
yes okay and and and for that it um
 
04:57:54.770 --> 04:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
it would make a huge difference from for
 
04:57:57.590 --> 04:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
schools that are struggling the most
 
04:57:57.600 --> 04:57:58.368 align:start position:0%
schools that are struggling the most
um

04:57:58.368 --> 04:57:58.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:01.190 --> 04:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
and uh and you know I'm sure I'm sure a
 
04:58:04.310 --> 04:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
you know detailed review could be but it
 
04:58:06.470 --> 04:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
let's let's don't worry about that money
 
04:58:08.990 --> 04:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
for a minute is the bill as it's
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
presented is this a good formula as you
 
04:58:15.350 --> 04:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
look through it 529 yeah absolutely it's
 
04:58:18.350 --> 04:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
it it starts at actually the The Rock
 
04:58:21.830 --> 04:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
Bottom equalized valuation per pupil
 
04:58:25.128 --> 04:58:25.138 align:start position:0%
um and uh I think it's 600 000 in the
 
04:58:27.650 --> 04:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
you know equalized valuation and goes up
 
04:58:30.230 --> 04:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
to 1.6 million dollars which is the
 
04:58:33.230 --> 04:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
average equalized valuation so it is
 
04:58:35.930 --> 04:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
absolutely getting that that lower
 
04:58:39.470 --> 04:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
um 50 okay that's also a formula which
 
04:58:41.830 --> 04:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
was developed by in 2018
 
04:58:45.230 --> 04:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
by the task force that Karen umberger uh
 
04:58:48.530 --> 04:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
ran uh so yes that's something we have
 
04:58:50.810 --> 04:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
to look at but also you take a town like
 
04:58:54.230 --> 04:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh Woodstock Lincoln area where their
 
04:58:56.390 --> 04:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
Equis property evaluations may be up
 
04:58:58.128 --> 04:58:58.138 align:start position:0%
there but they're medium family incomes
 
04:59:01.430 --> 04:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
are down in the dump and and so you have
 
04:59:03.650 --> 04:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
people living on land that are working
 
04:59:05.770 --> 04:59:05.780 align:start position:0%
in an hourly wage
 
04:59:08.690 --> 04:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
there's another Dynamic that we have to
 
04:59:10.550 --> 04:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
look at when we're allocating these
 
04:59:12.530 --> 04:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
resources it can't be strictly off of
 
04:59:15.530 --> 04:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
equalized property valuation per pupil
 
04:59:19.190 --> 04:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
and 529 includes that's 529 does that
 
04:59:21.230 --> 04:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
okay yeah and it does that through
 
04:59:24.170 --> 04:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
through looking at the percentage of the
 
04:59:26.830 --> 04:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
concentration of students that um that
 
04:59:29.090 --> 04:59:29.100 align:start position:0%
are part of the free and reduced price
 
04:59:31.250 --> 04:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
lunch program not to get them free or
 
04:59:33.948 --> 04:59:33.958 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunches but as a proxy for
 
04:59:37.850 --> 04:59:37.860 align:start position:0%
low income and um and and a chunk of of
 
04:59:40.850 --> 04:59:40.860 align:start position:0%
that of that state funding is associated
 
04:59:43.970 --> 04:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
uh with um you know to provide grants
 
04:59:46.190 --> 04:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
based on okay and finally with the the
 
04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal here my my concern
 
04:59:48.240 --> 04:59:49.010 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal here my my concern
is

04:59:49.010 --> 04:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:59:50.930 --> 04:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
I understand trying to whittle down the
 
04:59:50.940 --> 04:59:52.070 align:start position:0%
I understand trying to whittle down the
stabilization

04:59:52.070 --> 04:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
stabilization
 
04:59:54.890 --> 04:59:54.900 align:start position:0%
well the transition I don't want to see
 
04:59:56.810 --> 04:59:56.820 align:start position:0%
a lot of gaps and holes from the
 
04:59:59.570 --> 04:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
communities which are most needy that's
 
05:00:01.610 --> 05:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
not going to help things and so we've
 
05:00:04.128 --> 05:00:04.138 align:start position:0%
got to be careful that we're not having
 
05:00:05.990 --> 05:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
a waterfall effect every now and then
 
05:00:07.670 --> 05:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
for these these school districts we've
 
05:00:09.230 --> 05:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
gone through that and that was very
 
05:00:09.240 --> 05:00:11.270 align:start position:0%
gone through that and that was very
unsuccessful

05:00:11.270 --> 05:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful
 
05:00:14.150 --> 05:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
um and it would expedite it would
 
05:00:16.850 --> 05:00:16.860 align:start position:0%
expedite any kind of legal actions that
 
05:00:18.890 --> 05:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
we may be incurring in the future and I
 
05:00:21.170 --> 05:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
would try to certainly try to follow
 
05:00:22.550 --> 05:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
what the governor is providing us
 
05:00:26.690 --> 05:00:26.700 align:start position:0%
because that is a good uh uh blueprint
 
05:00:29.030 --> 05:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
for where we need to go but I would
 
05:00:30.708 --> 05:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
tweak it though in the places that we're
 
05:00:34.430 --> 05:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
encouraging you to look at so that we
 
05:00:37.550 --> 05:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
can get those dollars to the communities
 
05:00:40.128 --> 05:00:40.138 align:start position:0%
which actually have the most need for it
 
05:00:41.690 --> 05:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:00:44.930 --> 05:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
okay other questions
 
05:00:48.650 --> 05:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
anyone else that want to speak to 529
 
05:00:50.990 --> 05:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you thank you
 
05:00:53.510 --> 05:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
so the action on this would be to retain
 
05:00:56.930 --> 05:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
this and discuss it in hb2 look can I
 
05:01:00.850 --> 05:01:00.860 align:start position:0%
have them move by Joe Petri seconded by
 
05:01:05.690 --> 05:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
very hot I got it all those in favor
 
05:01:05.700 --> 05:01:07.368 align:start position:0%
very hot I got it all those in favor
okay

05:01:07.368 --> 05:01:07.378 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:01:12.948 --> 05:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:14.750 --> 05:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative Luna you have our last
 
05:01:19.730 --> 05:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:23.510 --> 05:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
which one you want to do first 5 20 6 26
 
05:01:25.490 --> 05:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
or 4 30.
 
05:01:27.830 --> 05:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
um let's um
 
05:01:30.830 --> 05:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
Let's do let's do 4 30 since I got that
 
05:01:39.948 --> 05:01:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:42.410 --> 05:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
so a little bit of History
 
05:01:42.420 --> 05:01:43.730 align:start position:0%
so a little bit of History
um

05:01:43.730 --> 05:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:47.208 --> 05:01:47.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:49.368 --> 05:01:49.378 align:start position:0%
4 30 came out of committee with no
 
05:01:49.378 --> 05:01:51.110 align:start position:0%
4 30 came out of committee with no
recommendation

05:01:51.110 --> 05:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
05:01:54.910 --> 05:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:59.330 --> 05:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
uh was tabled on the floor was taken off
 
05:02:02.810 --> 05:02:02.820 align:start position:0%
the table and was voted ought to pass
 
05:02:06.110 --> 05:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
and um and what the um what the bill
 
05:02:09.410 --> 05:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
does is um is is
 
05:02:11.150 --> 05:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
in the nutshell
 
05:02:11.160 --> 05:02:12.770 align:start position:0%
in the nutshell
um

05:02:12.770 --> 05:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:15.050 --> 05:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
um provides the policy that the
 
05:02:17.750 --> 05:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education stated when um
 
05:02:20.270 --> 05:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
when presenting the education Freedom
 
05:02:23.990 --> 05:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
account program to this committee uh and
 
05:02:25.788 --> 05:02:25.798 align:start position:0%
the and the finance committee in the
 
05:02:28.490 --> 05:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
Senate uh and the uh the education
 
05:02:30.410 --> 05:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
Committee in the house which retained
 
05:02:31.730 --> 05:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:02:35.090 --> 05:02:35.100 align:start position:0%
um back back two years ago uh and the
 
05:02:38.390 --> 05:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
the purpose was to provide
 
05:02:41.628 --> 05:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
students from low-income families
 
05:02:41.638 --> 05:02:43.368 align:start position:0%
students from low-income families
who

05:02:43.368 --> 05:02:43.378 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:02:45.948 --> 05:02:45.958 align:start position:0%
who felt they needed an alternative to
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
their public school to have some money
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
from the state use essentially the state
 
05:02:58.128 --> 05:02:58.138 align:start position:0%
adequacy Grant to um to open doors and
 
05:03:00.708 --> 05:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
and provide them with access to these
 
05:03:00.718 --> 05:03:03.050 align:start position:0%
and provide them with access to these
alternatives

05:03:03.050 --> 05:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
05:03:07.368 --> 05:03:07.378 align:start position:0%
what what we've seen from from reports
 
05:03:09.430 --> 05:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education
 
05:03:12.470 --> 05:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
indicate that closer to 80 percent of
 
05:03:15.770 --> 05:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
the students who participate in the EFA
 
05:03:19.390 --> 05:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
program were either already attending
 
05:03:22.788 --> 05:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
were already attending a private school
 
05:03:27.050 --> 05:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
or a home school prior to the uh
 
05:03:31.610 --> 05:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
adoption of the of the EFA program so in
 
05:03:32.570 --> 05:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
this case
 
05:03:35.690 --> 05:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
the these families and these students
 
05:03:38.930 --> 05:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
had already found alternatives to uh to
 
05:03:42.050 --> 05:03:42.060 align:start position:0%
their Public School uh when when you
 
05:03:44.030 --> 05:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
further take a look at the data and the
 
05:03:46.190 --> 05:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
number of students that go to private
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
school and home school and you look at
 
05:03:52.610 --> 05:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
um at the number of students that exit a
 
05:03:54.590 --> 05:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
public school every year and have done
 
05:03:57.110 --> 05:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
so for uh you know for many many many
 
05:04:00.410 --> 05:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
many years and decades I mean students
 
05:04:01.788 --> 05:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
leave public schools for a lot of
 
05:04:03.730 --> 05:04:03.740 align:start position:0%
different reasons they may have a family
 
05:04:07.250 --> 05:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
it may be sort of like a family history
 
05:04:09.948 --> 05:04:09.958 align:start position:0%
going to private school it may be that
 
05:04:11.930 --> 05:04:11.940 align:start position:0%
well I want to play football and my home
 
05:04:13.850 --> 05:04:13.860 align:start position:0%
school doesn't do football and I want to
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
go to a private school and and play on
 
05:04:17.390 --> 05:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
the team could be for a number of
 
05:04:20.930 --> 05:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
different reasons uh and um and when you
 
05:04:24.128 --> 05:04:24.138 align:start position:0%
sort of when you when you subtract out
 
05:04:27.948 --> 05:04:27.958 align:start position:0%
students that uh that that for all these
 
05:04:30.650 --> 05:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
reasons annually exit their their Public
 
05:04:33.170 --> 05:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
School it really does not look like too
 
05:04:35.750 --> 05:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
many of the 3200 students in the EFA
 
05:04:35.760 --> 05:04:37.788 align:start position:0%
many of the 3200 students in the EFA
program

05:04:37.788 --> 05:04:37.798 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:04:37.798 --> 05:04:39.470 align:start position:0%
program
uh

05:04:39.470 --> 05:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:04:41.868 --> 05:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
you know really really really left
 
05:04:44.090 --> 05:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
because of uh because of the
 
05:04:47.750 --> 05:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
availability of of the state funding and
 
05:04:49.368 --> 05:04:49.378 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a that's a real
 
05:04:51.230 --> 05:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
concern because it's a real departure
 
05:04:53.150 --> 05:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
from what the commissioner of Education
 
05:04:56.390 --> 05:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
spoke about two years ago so what what
 
05:05:01.430 --> 05:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
430 does is um is is it really says
 
05:05:03.350 --> 05:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
you've got to be um you know it says
 
05:05:05.868 --> 05:05:05.878 align:start position:0%
you've got to be a student in your um in
 
05:05:08.570 --> 05:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
your public school and uh and it doesn't
 
05:05:11.628 --> 05:05:11.638 align:start position:0%
require you to have any reasons for
 
05:05:13.490 --> 05:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
leaving you don't have to have a certain
 
05:05:16.430 --> 05:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
you know uh you know performance level
 
05:05:18.590 --> 05:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
or your outcomes you can make your your
 
05:05:20.750 --> 05:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
decision on your own it also doesn't
 
05:05:23.030 --> 05:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
affect any students that are already in
 
05:05:25.310 --> 05:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
the um the EFA program and there's been
 
05:05:27.530 --> 05:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
some misinformation put out some
 
05:05:31.270 --> 05:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
confusion uh on that but uh but the bill
 
05:05:34.430 --> 05:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
uses very simple language only only
 
05:05:36.470 --> 05:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
adding some new language on lines three
 
05:05:39.470 --> 05:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
and four uh I actually we actually took
 
05:05:43.010 --> 05:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
this language from some some amendments
 
05:05:46.868 --> 05:05:46.878 align:start position:0%
that came up four years ago during the
 
05:05:50.990 --> 05:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
work done on Senate Bill 193 uh that
 
05:05:52.670 --> 05:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
would would require would have required
 
05:05:54.530 --> 05:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
students to be currently attending their
 
05:05:56.150 --> 05:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
public school before
 
05:05:58.430 --> 05:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
um uh before applying to the uh to the
 
05:06:01.310 --> 05:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
EFA program and um
 
05:06:04.550 --> 05:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know that's what it does
 
05:06:04.560 --> 05:06:08.030 align:start position:0%
you know that's what it does
questions

05:06:08.030 --> 05:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:09.170 --> 05:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:11.690 --> 05:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative luno so
 
05:06:14.270 --> 05:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is very simple it just simply
 
05:06:17.270 --> 05:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
says that children have to be enrolled
 
05:06:19.970 --> 05:06:19.980 align:start position:0%
in a public school setting before they
 
05:06:24.530 --> 05:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
can apply for an EFA
 
05:06:27.470 --> 05:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that's that's exactly what
 
05:06:30.890 --> 05:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
it says and and and it basically says
 
05:06:32.570 --> 05:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
what I believe the commissioner of
 
05:06:36.170 --> 05:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
Education was saying that the that the
 
05:06:38.448 --> 05:06:38.458 align:start position:0%
the intent the purpose behind the
 
05:06:40.910 --> 05:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program is to
 
05:06:43.610 --> 05:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
open doors for students who are in their
 
05:06:46.250 --> 05:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
Public Schools seeking an old and a
 
05:06:48.948 --> 05:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
private alternative thank you
 
05:06:51.230 --> 05:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
push with you okay
 
05:06:53.150 --> 05:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:06:55.490 --> 05:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
taking the question my question is based
 
05:06:58.190 --> 05:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
on my personal experience uh when I
 
05:07:00.948 --> 05:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
lived in Waltham I started with I had
 
05:07:02.810 --> 05:07:02.820 align:start position:0%
two girls you know five years and a half
 
05:07:05.930 --> 05:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
apart by the time my eldest was in
 
05:07:07.430 --> 05:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
fourth grade the public schools were
 
05:07:09.770 --> 05:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
failing her completely we moved her to
 
05:07:11.270 --> 05:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
05:07:13.490 --> 05:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
Catholic school that was the only
 
05:07:15.770 --> 05:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
private school we could afford God knows
 
05:07:18.470 --> 05:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
that stuff is expensive
 
05:07:21.470 --> 05:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
according to your bill when my younger
 
05:07:21.480 --> 05:07:22.730 align:start position:0%
according to your bill when my younger
kid

05:07:22.730 --> 05:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
kid
 
05:07:25.010 --> 05:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
you know reached school age
 
05:07:28.010 --> 05:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
they would have had to attend the same
 
05:07:30.650 --> 05:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
public school that failed my eldest kid
 
05:07:33.830 --> 05:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
for at least one year before they would
 
05:07:35.990 --> 05:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
be allowed to leave I'm trying to
 
05:07:38.208 --> 05:07:38.218 align:start position:0%
understand in a situation like this
 
05:07:39.830 --> 05:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
which is one of the many you know
 
05:07:41.830 --> 05:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
situations that could occur in this case
 
05:07:44.750 --> 05:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
how is it in the public interest to
 
05:07:47.390 --> 05:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
create this scenario where a parent who
 
05:07:49.970 --> 05:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
already had a kid School failed them
 
05:07:51.650 --> 05:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
they already know they don't want to go
 
05:07:53.030 --> 05:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
to that school
 
05:07:56.690 --> 05:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
what what is the public good coming out
 
05:07:58.970 --> 05:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
of the forcing my second and third or
 
05:08:01.490 --> 05:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
whatever other kids to attend the same
 
05:08:04.010 --> 05:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
school that failed you know or could
 
05:08:05.990 --> 05:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
their parents felt failed their first
 
05:08:08.090 --> 05:08:08.100 align:start position:0%
kid sure no thanks very much for the
 
05:08:10.610 --> 05:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
question and and and I think that's
 
05:08:12.770 --> 05:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
that's why um
 
05:08:14.868 --> 05:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
um why why there's an exception made
 
05:08:17.510 --> 05:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
towards the end of line four or who is
 
05:08:20.448 --> 05:08:20.458 align:start position:0%
entering kindergarten or first grade so
 
05:08:22.910 --> 05:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
um so if you're if you're you know let's
 
05:08:25.550 --> 05:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
say you're you're uh third or fourth
 
05:08:28.128 --> 05:08:28.138 align:start position:0%
grade student who was struggling in or
 
05:08:31.250 --> 05:08:31.260 align:start position:0%
or where their needs or her needs were
 
05:08:33.650 --> 05:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
not being met in their public school
 
05:08:36.610 --> 05:08:36.620 align:start position:0%
where their younger siblings uh become
 
05:08:40.010 --> 05:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
uh eligible age eligible for
 
05:08:42.170 --> 05:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
kindergarten or first grade they don't
 
05:08:44.990 --> 05:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
have to matriculate into their public
 
05:08:47.930 --> 05:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
school they can immediately apply for a
 
05:08:51.410 --> 05:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
uh for an EFA follow up
 
05:08:52.730 --> 05:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:08:54.890 --> 05:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
I actually agree that that scenario
 
05:08:56.628 --> 05:08:56.638 align:start position:0%
would not have applied to my particular
 
05:08:59.510 --> 05:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
situation actually that's
 
05:09:02.570 --> 05:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
I miss that part so okay that's why we
 
05:09:04.910 --> 05:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
have cute I don't know but I appreciate
 
05:09:07.430 --> 05:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
that point still similar situations
 
05:09:09.590 --> 05:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
occur you know what would happen to
 
05:09:11.030 --> 05:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who moves from out of state
 
05:09:13.550 --> 05:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
already tried Public Schools moves into
 
05:09:15.770 --> 05:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire now they get caught into
 
05:09:17.690 --> 05:09:17.700 align:start position:0%
oh geez now you gotta go to public
 
05:09:19.310 --> 05:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire obviously it
 
05:09:21.770 --> 05:09:21.780 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the same exact Public School
 
05:09:24.230 --> 05:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
but still again what's the policy
 
05:09:26.990 --> 05:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of that with somebody who you
 
05:09:28.550 --> 05:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
know already tried public schools in
 
05:09:31.190 --> 05:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
another state comes here
 
05:09:33.770 --> 05:09:33.780 align:start position:0%
why are we requiring them to attend yeah
 
05:09:36.110 --> 05:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
no that's a that's a good question I
 
05:09:38.390 --> 05:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
mean I I guess I would I I don't you
 
05:09:38.400 --> 05:09:39.430 align:start position:0%
mean I I guess I would I I don't you
know

05:09:39.430 --> 05:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:09:39.440 --> 05:09:41.470 align:start position:0%
know
I

05:09:41.470 --> 05:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:09:44.150 --> 05:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
mean to start with New Hampshire has
 
05:09:46.010 --> 05:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
some of the best public school and the
 
05:09:47.868 --> 05:09:47.878 align:start position:0%
some of the best student outcomes in the
 
05:09:51.590 --> 05:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
country so so I guess I would argue that
 
05:09:53.330 --> 05:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
if you came from any other state
 
05:09:56.690 --> 05:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
possibly even any other country that uh
 
05:09:59.570 --> 05:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
that you and coming to New Hampshire you
 
05:10:01.310 --> 05:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
may have some of the best public school
 
05:10:02.930 --> 05:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
opportunities that are available
 
05:10:06.890 --> 05:10:06.900 align:start position:0%
anywhere and um and and why not give
 
05:10:08.510 --> 05:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
them a try
 
05:10:10.970 --> 05:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
um uh honestly you know we we certainly
 
05:10:13.970 --> 05:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of money uh on them uh New
 
05:10:17.690 --> 05:10:17.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is um on average uh right in
 
05:10:20.510 --> 05:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
the mix you know you know of things you
 
05:10:22.610 --> 05:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
know in terms of per pupil spending of
 
05:10:25.010 --> 05:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
the of our New England states
 
05:10:28.250 --> 05:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
and um and you know we're our I think
 
05:10:30.470 --> 05:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
our student outcomes are a little bit
 
05:10:32.390 --> 05:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
behind Massachusetts which I think is
 
05:10:33.890 --> 05:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
known for having some of the strongest
 
05:10:37.010 --> 05:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
outcomes uh nationally
 
05:10:40.010 --> 05:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
um uh you know if if people are moving
 
05:10:41.170 --> 05:10:41.180 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire
 
05:10:44.570 --> 05:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
uh they probably got a reason and they
 
05:10:46.670 --> 05:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
love our lakes and our ocean and our
 
05:10:49.910 --> 05:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
Mount our mountains a lot of people tell
 
05:10:52.070 --> 05:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
me in fact this is the first time I've
 
05:10:55.310 --> 05:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
ever said this at uh or you know made a
 
05:10:57.590 --> 05:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
made a made a statement like this in in
 
05:11:00.288 --> 05:11:00.298 align:start position:0%
testimony we hear it all the time my
 
05:11:02.090 --> 05:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
constituents tell me they like this or
 
05:11:03.650 --> 05:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
they don't like that or something like
 
05:11:05.930 --> 05:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
that or I hear this all the time what I
 
05:11:07.368 --> 05:11:07.378 align:start position:0%
do here all the time
 
05:11:09.110 --> 05:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
is that people move to New Hampshire
 
05:11:11.270 --> 05:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
because of the schools I hear that
 
05:11:13.010 --> 05:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
particularly from from people in
 
05:11:15.170 --> 05:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton I hear that from my
 
05:11:18.170 --> 05:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
constituents our constituents all the
 
05:11:20.810 --> 05:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
time they move to New Hampshire because
 
05:11:22.670 --> 05:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
of the schools
 
05:11:27.350 --> 05:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
so just I lost last second last thing
 
05:11:29.150 --> 05:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
as it happens I'm one of the people that
 
05:11:30.590 --> 05:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
moved to New Hampshire and specifically
 
05:11:32.510 --> 05:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
Windham because of the high quality of
 
05:11:34.430 --> 05:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
the public school system our kids have
 
05:11:36.650 --> 05:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
been in that forever I've served on the
 
05:11:38.270 --> 05:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
school board I'm running again for the
 
05:11:40.010 --> 05:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
school board we have an excellent you
 
05:11:41.750 --> 05:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
know public school system
 
05:11:45.170 --> 05:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
it's just that I recognize that not all
 
05:11:46.970 --> 05:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
people moved to New Hampshire for the
 
05:11:48.590 --> 05:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
same reason and I'm personally
 
05:11:50.868 --> 05:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with the thought of
 
05:11:53.448 --> 05:11:53.458 align:start position:0%
telling somebody well you moved in now
 
05:11:55.128 --> 05:11:55.138 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have to do this whether you
 
05:11:56.628 --> 05:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
like it or not I think you make an
 
05:11:58.368 --> 05:11:58.378 align:start position:0%
excellent case as to why the vast
 
05:12:01.250 --> 05:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
majority of people coming in would not
 
05:12:03.350 --> 05:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
need this to send their kids to public
 
05:12:05.510 --> 05:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
schools and I would argue that you know
 
05:12:07.190 --> 05:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
people who come in with different
 
05:12:09.110 --> 05:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
thoughts you know should have a
 
05:12:11.030 --> 05:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
different choice but I really appreciate
 
05:12:12.590 --> 05:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
you clarifying and thank you for
 
05:12:16.550 --> 05:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:19.788 --> 05:12:19.798 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account was a very
 
05:12:21.770 --> 05:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
successful program
 
05:12:23.448 --> 05:12:23.458 align:start position:0%
you have always been one of its
 
05:12:25.550 --> 05:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
detractors and I think this is trying to
 
05:12:31.970 --> 05:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:31.980 --> 05:12:33.170 align:start position:0%
 
Harry

05:12:33.170 --> 05:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
Harry
 
05:12:36.650 --> 05:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
um so I I actually there was a a comment
 
05:12:38.570 --> 05:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
made saying I've always been one of the
 
05:12:41.510 --> 05:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
detractors I uh and I do want to address
 
05:12:44.868 --> 05:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
that I think it's important I think
 
05:12:44.878 --> 05:12:45.590 align:start position:0%
that I think it's important I think
um

05:12:45.590 --> 05:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:49.190 --> 05:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
as all of us are are elected as all of
 
05:12:51.230 --> 05:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
us are representing constituents not
 
05:12:53.448 --> 05:12:53.458 align:start position:0%
just in our own communities but across
 
05:12:54.410 --> 05:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:12:56.510 --> 05:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
and certainly the education Freedom
 
05:12:59.090 --> 05:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
account program are paid those tax
 
05:13:02.330 --> 05:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
monies are paid for by people all across
 
05:13:03.650 --> 05:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
the state they're not paid for through
 
05:13:05.750 --> 05:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
local property taxes business Enterprise
 
05:13:08.030 --> 05:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
tax business profits tax Lottery we know
 
05:13:10.430 --> 05:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
we know the smattering of sources on
 
05:13:14.868 --> 05:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
there but but but I personally feel and
 
05:13:17.208 --> 05:13:17.218 align:start position:0%
uh that I have a responsibility to make
 
05:13:18.770 --> 05:13:18.780 align:start position:0%
sure that we put a program in place
 
05:13:20.990 --> 05:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
that's responsible and has reasonable
 
05:13:23.570 --> 05:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
guard rails if people don't feel that
 
05:13:27.470 --> 05:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
way then I I don't know I mean I'm not
 
05:13:29.930 --> 05:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
sure what what what constituents might
 
05:13:32.150 --> 05:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
think about not being responsible and
 
05:13:35.448 --> 05:13:35.458 align:start position:0%
not providing reasonable guard rails in
 
05:13:38.930 --> 05:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
that chair over there last week two
 
05:13:41.570 --> 05:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
weeks ago the governor said I think in
 
05:13:43.070 --> 05:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
response to representative Heath's
 
05:13:45.050 --> 05:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
question that that he would support
 
05:13:47.090 --> 05:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
reasonable guard rails on the program
 
05:13:50.030 --> 05:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
and to the extent this program was
 
05:13:52.910 --> 05:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
presented as an opportunity for students
 
05:13:55.190 --> 05:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
from low-income families who were
 
05:13:57.530 --> 05:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
attending their public schools and are
 
05:14:00.230 --> 05:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
looking for an alternative to that a
 
05:14:03.830 --> 05:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
private alternative than then then House
 
05:14:07.128 --> 05:14:07.138 align:start position:0%
Bill 430 fits the bill
 
05:14:07.138 --> 05:14:08.208 align:start position:0%
Bill 430 fits the bill
sorry

05:14:08.208 --> 05:14:08.218 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:14:10.368 --> 05:14:10.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:14:12.170 --> 05:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
my question I want to know what the
 
05:14:14.990 --> 05:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is
 
05:14:16.970 --> 05:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
um thanks very much for the question uh
 
05:14:19.490 --> 05:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
I I would say just just like what what I
 
05:14:21.948 --> 05:14:21.958 align:start position:0%
just said for the um for the for the
 
05:14:25.368 --> 05:14:25.378 align:start position:0%
program to um uh to be to be structured
 
05:14:28.910 --> 05:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
to just as it was introduced and
 
05:14:31.610 --> 05:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
presented two years ago uh by the
 
05:14:34.310 --> 05:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education to open doors
 
05:14:36.288 --> 05:14:36.298 align:start position:0%
for students who are in their Public
 
05:14:38.930 --> 05:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
Schools who needed a private alternative
 
05:14:41.990 --> 05:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
and um and so it doesn't do anything
 
05:14:44.270 --> 05:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
with the with the income requirement it
 
05:14:47.570 --> 05:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
leaves that leaves that in place but um
 
05:14:51.650 --> 05:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
but but to to provide an alternative to
 
05:14:53.690 --> 05:14:53.700 align:start position:0%
students and students
 
05:14:56.390 --> 05:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
um uh rather than their instead of their
 
05:14:59.030 --> 05:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
public schools and so if you're if
 
05:15:01.250 --> 05:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
you're in public school you can get an
 
05:15:01.260 --> 05:15:02.330 align:start position:0%
you're in public school you can get an
alternative

05:15:02.330 --> 05:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
05:15:05.628 --> 05:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
um through the EFA uh uh uh to your
 
05:15:08.330 --> 05:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
public school if you're just getting of
 
05:15:11.090 --> 05:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
age into kindergarten or first grade you
 
05:15:12.350 --> 05:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
can still
 
05:15:15.170 --> 05:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
um uh seek out in an EFA got the
 
05:15:18.650 --> 05:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
exceptions uh for that so so that's what
 
05:15:25.490 --> 05:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:26.930 --> 05:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:15:26.940 --> 05:15:28.550 align:start position:0%
thank you
question

05:15:28.550 --> 05:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:15:31.850 --> 05:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you other states have efas do
 
05:15:33.470 --> 05:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
other states have a similar guardrail
 
05:15:35.750 --> 05:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
program like this or is this particular
 
05:15:39.050 --> 05:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
to us no thanks thanks very much
 
05:15:41.570 --> 05:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
um and um and and and thanks for
 
05:15:43.550 --> 05:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
speaking with Me Kate Murray especially
 
05:15:46.850 --> 05:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
after all my my comments on your your uh
 
05:15:49.490 --> 05:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
your town I'm feeling a little isolated
 
05:15:51.708 --> 05:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
here but
 
05:15:51.718 --> 05:15:52.250 align:start position:0%
here but
um

05:15:52.250 --> 05:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:57.190 --> 05:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
yeah but um but yeah other other um my
 
05:15:59.628 --> 05:15:59.638 align:start position:0%
understanding is that other states do
 
05:16:03.410 --> 05:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
have um uh limitations such as this and
 
05:16:07.490 --> 05:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
and uh and what you what you do find in
 
05:16:09.590 --> 05:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
those other states is that the
 
05:16:13.310 --> 05:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
participation in the um in those um uh
 
05:16:16.070 --> 05:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh education savings account or School
 
05:16:18.350 --> 05:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
voucher or whatever the states want to
 
05:16:19.490 --> 05:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
call them
 
05:16:21.770 --> 05:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
um is much lower than than New
 
05:16:25.128 --> 05:16:25.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's because it's not it's not
 
05:16:27.110 --> 05:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
picking up you know it's not spending
 
05:16:29.330 --> 05:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
eighty percent of its dollars picking up
 
05:16:31.970 --> 05:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
students that were already in um in
 
05:16:35.030 --> 05:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
private schools uh it's uh it's students
 
05:16:36.830 --> 05:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
who are exiting their their public
 
05:16:39.650 --> 05:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
school and and I think you know probably
 
05:16:43.128 --> 05:16:43.138 align:start position:0%
deep down most of us would realize the
 
05:16:43.138 --> 05:16:43.670 align:start position:0%
deep down most of us would realize the
um

05:16:43.670 --> 05:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:46.310 --> 05:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know that that that that's a
 
05:16:49.190 --> 05:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
different difficult call for most um uh
 
05:16:51.350 --> 05:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
for most students that that they've got
 
05:16:52.730 --> 05:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
to leave their friends leave their
 
05:16:55.010 --> 05:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
teachers they've got to find a way to
 
05:16:57.590 --> 05:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
get transported to to
 
05:17:00.890 --> 05:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
um to either an uh a private school or a
 
05:17:03.948 --> 05:17:03.958 align:start position:0%
homeschooling type type situation and
 
05:17:05.990 --> 05:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's not a it's it's really not an easy
 
05:17:09.230 --> 05:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
decision for kids that are already in in
 
05:17:12.288 --> 05:17:12.298 align:start position:0%
um uh in in their Public Schools but for
 
05:17:13.670 --> 05:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
students that have already students and
 
05:17:15.110 --> 05:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
families that have already made the
 
05:17:16.910 --> 05:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
decision that are Income eligible
 
05:17:18.650 --> 05:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
they're already in a private school
 
05:17:20.990 --> 05:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
environment and the state's saying here
 
05:17:23.750 --> 05:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
you go here's a here's a
 
05:17:25.730 --> 05:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
um you know five six seven eight
 
05:17:28.128 --> 05:17:28.138 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar check
 
05:17:30.410 --> 05:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
um that you can put towards your tuition
 
05:17:32.150 --> 05:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
bills who wouldn't who wouldn't reach
 
05:17:34.730 --> 05:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
out their hand and take that I mean it's
 
05:17:37.368 --> 05:17:37.378 align:start position:0%
um it's it's it's
 
05:17:40.670 --> 05:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
free money from the state uh free
 
05:17:42.948 --> 05:17:42.958 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money from the state to pay uh
 
05:17:46.128 --> 05:17:46.138 align:start position:0%
private school tuition bill and and uh
 
05:17:49.090 --> 05:17:49.100 align:start position:0%
you know it was
 
05:17:51.110 --> 05:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know you know so representative
 
05:17:53.690 --> 05:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
Weiler I I certainly you heard me say
 
05:17:55.788 --> 05:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
similar things well you heard me say
 
05:17:57.650 --> 05:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
similar things I think
 
05:17:57.660 --> 05:17:59.330 align:start position:0%
similar things I think
so

05:17:59.330 --> 05:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:18:02.930 --> 05:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
um uh two years ago when when I found it
 
05:18:05.810 --> 05:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
very hard to believe that only four uh
 
05:18:08.628 --> 05:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
private school students were estimated
 
05:18:11.810 --> 05:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
to uh were estimated that we're going to
 
05:18:15.650 --> 05:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
um take the the um the join the EFA
 
05:18:20.030 --> 05:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
program and um and certainly we saw most
 
05:18:22.730 --> 05:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
of the students come from these private
 
05:18:25.010 --> 05:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
school environments and and I you know I
 
05:18:26.628 --> 05:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
think that was sort of easy to see
 
05:18:30.770 --> 05:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:30.780 --> 05:18:33.830 align:start position:0%
 
then

05:18:33.830 --> 05:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:36.770 --> 05:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair quick follow-up you
 
05:18:38.868 --> 05:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
were saying that you know giving money
 
05:18:40.430 --> 05:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
to students who are already in private
 
05:18:42.288 --> 05:18:42.298 align:start position:0%
school is you know retakes per money
 
05:18:44.150 --> 05:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
from the state to pay a private tuition
 
05:18:44.160 --> 05:18:45.770 align:start position:0%
from the state to pay a private tuition
bill

05:18:45.770 --> 05:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:18:48.050 --> 05:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
I cannot help but think about the many
 
05:18:50.570 --> 05:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
towns that do exactly the same thing
 
05:18:52.850 --> 05:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
with Pinkerton Academy and other private
 
05:18:52.860 --> 05:18:54.050 align:start position:0%
with Pinkerton Academy and other private
schools

05:18:54.050 --> 05:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:18:56.930 --> 05:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
isn't it the duty of the state to
 
05:18:59.270 --> 05:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
provide that adequate education funding
 
05:19:01.250 --> 05:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
to you know every child shouldn't that
 
05:19:01.260 --> 05:19:02.390 align:start position:0%
to you know every child shouldn't that
include

05:19:02.390 --> 05:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
include
 
05:19:05.628 --> 05:19:05.638 align:start position:0%
some form of adequacy support to parents
 
05:19:08.208 --> 05:19:08.218 align:start position:0%
who have chosen a private school rather
 
05:19:10.010 --> 05:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
than the public school
 
05:19:11.810 --> 05:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
just in terms of the duty of the state
 
05:19:14.510 --> 05:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
since we talk about so much sure no no
 
05:19:16.128 --> 05:19:16.138 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks and that's a very good
 
05:19:16.138 --> 05:19:16.970 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks and that's a very good
question

05:19:16.970 --> 05:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:19:20.090 --> 05:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
um the um and I'm I'm I'm not I'm not
 
05:19:22.010 --> 05:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
equipped here to be able to quote from
 
05:19:24.410 --> 05:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
the the State Constitution and
 
05:19:26.750 --> 05:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
oftentimes this part is misquoted and I
 
05:19:27.770 --> 05:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
don't want to be one of those people
 
05:19:30.530 --> 05:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
that misquotes it but but I do believe
 
05:19:33.550 --> 05:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
our our the New Hampshire Constitution
 
05:19:37.550 --> 05:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
requires all municipalities I'm sorry
 
05:19:40.970 --> 05:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
requires um yeah all municipalities to
 
05:19:43.430 --> 05:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
provide an education
 
05:19:46.628 --> 05:19:46.638 align:start position:0%
um to all of for all of its children and
 
05:19:50.930 --> 05:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
the state to do so through funding of
 
05:19:54.590 --> 05:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
public schools and and the though those
 
05:19:57.110 --> 05:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
two it's it's not in the Constitution as
 
05:19:59.090 --> 05:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
sort of like one run-on sentence like I
 
05:20:01.550 --> 05:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
just said but but it's got those it
 
05:20:04.490 --> 05:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
contains those two specific uh
 
05:20:06.830 --> 05:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligations
 
05:20:11.150 --> 05:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
and and so no I don't think the um I
 
05:20:13.430 --> 05:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
don't think the EFA program is anything
 
05:20:15.590 --> 05:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's that falls out of our state
 
05:20:18.050 --> 05:20:18.060 align:start position:0%
constitution as a requirement nor do I
 
05:20:18.060 --> 05:20:18.890 align:start position:0%
constitution as a requirement nor do I
think

05:20:18.890 --> 05:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:20:21.110 --> 05:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
um that Charter Schools fall out of our
 
05:20:24.830 --> 05:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
state constitution as a requirement that
 
05:20:27.430 --> 05:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
um uh and I've I have had conversations
 
05:20:30.110 --> 05:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
with attorneys at the Department of
 
05:20:33.230 --> 05:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
Education that says the state meets its
 
05:20:36.410 --> 05:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
requirements constitutional requirement
 
05:20:37.970 --> 05:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
um through through public school
 
05:20:37.980 --> 05:20:39.288 align:start position:0%
um through through public school
districts

05:20:39.288 --> 05:20:39.298 align:start position:0%
districts
 
05:20:42.230 --> 05:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate your answer
 
05:20:42.240 --> 05:20:44.030 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate your answer
yeah

05:20:44.030 --> 05:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:20:47.270 --> 05:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
this bill would not be before us but for
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
a lack of attendance of sufficient
 
05:20:52.128 --> 05:20:52.138 align:start position:0%
Republicans I would move in expedient to
 
05:20:55.010 --> 05:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
legisly it's an attack on a successful
 
05:20:55.020 --> 05:21:10.330 align:start position:0%
legisly it's an attack on a successful
program

05:21:10.330 --> 05:21:10.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:13.970 --> 05:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
I hadn't said anything yet cut me a
 
05:21:15.890 --> 05:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
little slack here
 
05:21:19.368 --> 05:21:19.378 align:start position:0%
I did talk to our
 
05:21:21.288 --> 05:21:21.298 align:start position:0%
senior member
 
05:21:23.948 --> 05:21:23.958 align:start position:0%
and I said we would not take any votes
 
05:21:26.930 --> 05:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
unless we have substitutes
 
05:21:31.610 --> 05:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
so if if you would like to get get
 
05:21:33.948 --> 05:21:33.958 align:start position:0%
substitutes or we can schedule the vote
 
05:21:37.788 --> 05:21:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:37.798 --> 05:21:42.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:21:42.410 --> 05:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:44.110 --> 05:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
not a problem
 
05:21:46.670 --> 05:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
so I would make the same motion on the
 
05:21:48.890 --> 05:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
next bill
 
05:21:52.550 --> 05:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
so we're ready to move to uh to 626 and
 
05:21:55.250 --> 05:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
yeah so we're going to hold this and
 
05:21:57.170 --> 05:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
take action at another time okay we're
 
05:21:58.430 --> 05:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
not going to take action on that one
 
05:22:00.288 --> 05:22:00.298 align:start position:0%

I would give us for the same courtesy
 
05:23:12.350 --> 05:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
that we give any other members
 
05:23:15.050 --> 05:23:15.060 align:start position:0%

05:23:20.750 --> 05:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
to allow him to speak for the purpose of
 
05:23:21.948 --> 05:23:21.958 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:23:24.470 --> 05:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much Mr
 
05:23:24.480 --> 05:23:25.490 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much Mr
chair

05:23:25.490 --> 05:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:23:30.590 --> 05:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 626 is um uh is not a
 
05:23:33.948 --> 05:23:33.958 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill and um and it's a bill
 
05:23:38.628 --> 05:23:38.638 align:start position:0%
that that would change the uh it would
 
05:23:42.170 --> 05:23:42.180 align:start position:0%
move the administration of the EFA
 
05:23:45.650 --> 05:23:45.660 align:start position:0%
program from a private contractor and I
 
05:23:46.970 --> 05:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
believe there's one that's been
 
05:23:49.190 --> 05:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
authorized by the uh the executive
 
05:23:50.510 --> 05:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
Council called the children's
 
05:23:53.030 --> 05:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund it would move the
 
05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
administration the the administration of
 
05:23:58.070 --> 05:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
the program from that private contractor
 
05:24:00.650 --> 05:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education
 
05:24:03.470 --> 05:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
and um and I'll I'll set the stage I'll
 
05:24:06.288 --> 05:24:06.298 align:start position:0%
try to do it very very quickly on on on
 
05:24:07.970 --> 05:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:24:07.980 --> 05:24:08.570 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

05:24:08.570 --> 05:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:12.708 --> 05:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
uh it also came out of our committee
 
05:24:18.350 --> 05:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
with uh with out recommendation and um
 
05:24:22.190 --> 05:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
and and was was passed on the um the
 
05:24:23.810 --> 05:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
house floor
 
05:24:26.628 --> 05:24:26.638 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:24:26.638 --> 05:24:30.250 align:start position:0%
the um
the

05:24:30.250 --> 05:24:30.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:33.288 --> 05:24:33.298 align:start position:0%
currently currently the the private
 
05:24:35.510 --> 05:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
contractor and is administering a
 
05:24:38.270 --> 05:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
program that uh in the first two years
 
05:24:40.250 --> 05:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
of the program
 
05:24:45.550 --> 05:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
um uh cost um cost the state
 
05:24:45.560 --> 05:24:47.170 align:start position:0%
um uh cost um cost the state
approximately

05:24:47.170 --> 05:24:47.180 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
05:24:51.470 --> 05:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
nine million dollars and in the second
 
05:24:53.868 --> 05:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
two years of the program of the program
 
05:24:57.350 --> 05:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
is costing the state I think closer to
 
05:25:01.850 --> 05:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
to uh to 14 million dollars so 25
 
05:25:04.730 --> 05:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
million dollars total in the first first
 
05:25:07.490 --> 05:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
four I'm sorry first two years Sports
 
05:25:10.190 --> 05:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
and first year of the program cost nine
 
05:25:11.750 --> 05:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars second year of the
 
05:25:15.470 --> 05:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
program 14 million dollars so so uh so
 
05:25:17.050 --> 05:25:17.060 align:start position:0%
in the first two years of the program
 
05:25:21.350 --> 05:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
costing uh taxpayers about 23 24 million
 
05:25:21.360 --> 05:25:22.910 align:start position:0%
costing uh taxpayers about 23 24 million
dollars

05:25:22.910 --> 05:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:25:26.750 --> 05:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
um for 3200 students the the Department
 
05:25:31.128 --> 05:25:31.138 align:start position:0%
of Education obviously manages uh uh
 
05:25:33.948 --> 05:25:33.958 align:start position:0%
over a billion dollars of State money
 
05:25:37.850 --> 05:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
plus two billion dollars of um of local
 
05:25:40.610 --> 05:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
property taxpayer money that is
 
05:25:43.910 --> 05:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
appropriated to school budgets uh with
 
05:25:46.970 --> 05:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
with total um program enrollment of
 
05:25:48.948 --> 05:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
approximately 165
 
05:25:51.170 --> 05:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
000 students so I would certainly say
 
05:25:53.448 --> 05:25:53.458 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Education is
 
05:25:56.510 --> 05:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
certainly equipped to be able to uh to
 
05:25:59.390 --> 05:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
handle programs of this magnitude given
 
05:26:02.030 --> 05:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
what they're doing right now but beyond
 
05:26:02.040 --> 05:26:03.170 align:start position:0%
what they're doing right now but beyond
that

05:26:03.170 --> 05:26:03.180 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:26:07.190 --> 05:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
I think is um is is is something that is
 
05:26:11.090 --> 05:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
is is a bit of a sort of a uh you know
 
05:26:14.270 --> 05:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
is sort of financially
 
05:26:14.280 --> 05:26:15.530 align:start position:0%
is sort of financially
um

05:26:15.530 --> 05:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:18.708 --> 05:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
um inefficient in the in the EFA program
 
05:26:20.690 --> 05:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
and and that's where the the private
 
05:26:24.890 --> 05:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
contractor gets to retain 10 of the uh
 
05:26:26.868 --> 05:26:26.878 align:start position:0%
of the state money that goes into the
 
05:26:29.390 --> 05:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
program so in the first two years of the
 
05:26:32.690 --> 05:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
program you know this this uh 23 million
 
05:26:36.830 --> 05:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
dollars there they can retain uh 10 of
 
05:26:39.288 --> 05:26:39.298 align:start position:0%
of that money I think they've testified
 
05:26:41.330 --> 05:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
in our committee that that maybe they've
 
05:26:44.868 --> 05:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
retained like nine percent of uh uh of
 
05:26:49.190 --> 05:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
that and um and that's a lot of money
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
um you know uh over two million dollars
 
05:26:54.470 --> 05:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
and where the program is going right now
 
05:26:57.470 --> 05:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
where the the commissioner of education
 
05:27:00.350 --> 05:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
has requested another 60 million dollars
 
05:27:04.610 --> 05:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
over the next biennium so so close to 90
 
05:27:06.650 --> 05:27:06.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars on the first four years
 
05:27:09.890 --> 05:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
of the program uh that's um you know ten
 
05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
percent is nine close to nine million
 
05:27:16.010 --> 05:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
dollars and um and it would seem to me
 
05:27:20.030 --> 05:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
and others that uh that the state may
 
05:27:24.230 --> 05:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
able may be able to um to administer uh
 
05:27:26.868 --> 05:27:26.878 align:start position:0%
the program in a um in a much more cost
 
05:27:30.590 --> 05:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
efficient way some people have have said
 
05:27:30.600 --> 05:27:31.730 align:start position:0%
efficient way some people have have said
well

05:27:31.730 --> 05:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:27:33.410 --> 05:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
10 percent
 
05:27:36.110 --> 05:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
that's sort of along the same you know
 
05:27:38.390 --> 05:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
in the same ballpark as to what Public
 
05:27:40.970 --> 05:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
Schools administrative costs are you
 
05:27:43.430 --> 05:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
know for the sau's and and uh and
 
05:27:46.430 --> 05:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
administration but keep in mind this
 
05:27:49.550 --> 05:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
isn't a pro the EFA is not a program
 
05:27:53.868 --> 05:27:53.878 align:start position:0%
that that administers education it
 
05:27:57.590 --> 05:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
channels taxpayer dollars uh to be
 
05:27:59.690 --> 05:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
directed where the parents you know
 
05:28:01.788 --> 05:28:01.798 align:start position:0%
where the parents wish them to be
 
05:28:05.810 --> 05:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
directed to an organization such as uh
 
05:28:07.850 --> 05:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
such as a Catholic school or another
 
05:28:12.050 --> 05:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
private school or or uh to uh to to to
 
05:28:15.410 --> 05:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
to pay those those costs and those costs
 
05:28:17.690 --> 05:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
that they're that this money is paying
 
05:28:22.070 --> 05:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
for already include a 10 to 15 percent
 
05:28:23.690 --> 05:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
um you know cost associated with
 
05:28:26.090 --> 05:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
administering that program so we're very
 
05:28:29.208 --> 05:28:29.218 align:start position:0%
quickly uh turning you know State money
 
05:28:32.448 --> 05:28:32.458 align:start position:0%
into something that 10 comes off here
 
05:28:34.430 --> 05:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
and then it goes to a private school
 
05:28:38.830 --> 05:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
another 15 percent comes off here and uh
 
05:28:42.470 --> 05:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
and so the the uh you know the purpose
 
05:28:47.090 --> 05:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
the intent behind House Bill 626 is to
 
05:28:49.310 --> 05:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
um to have the um have the Department of
 
05:28:53.628 --> 05:28:53.638 align:start position:0%
Education manage this program and um and
 
05:28:56.150 --> 05:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh be much more more efficient in terms
 
05:28:59.150 --> 05:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
the use of taxpayer dollars that are
 
05:29:03.170 --> 05:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
used for efas and um and direct more of
 
05:29:07.510 --> 05:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
those EFA dollars to um uh to uh
 
05:29:10.550 --> 05:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
providing alternatives for students as
 
05:29:13.430 --> 05:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to funding a private contractor
 
05:29:15.050 --> 05:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
okay questions
 
05:29:16.910 --> 05:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chair
 
05:29:19.788 --> 05:29:19.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:29:23.150 --> 05:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
um I am I don't know if I'm a co-sponsor
 
05:29:25.190 --> 05:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
of this I guess not but I am a supporter
 
05:29:27.350 --> 05:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
of this bill as a former Deputy
 
05:29:31.690 --> 05:29:31.700 align:start position:0%
Commissioner I am really concerned about
 
05:29:35.690 --> 05:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
over 60 million dollars being
 
05:29:41.208 --> 05:29:41.218 align:start position:0%
overseen by uh private organization I
 
05:29:42.590 --> 05:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
have no complaints about the
 
05:29:45.470 --> 05:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
organization per se I simply feel that
 
05:29:48.948 --> 05:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
when we're dealing with taxpayer money
 
05:29:50.990 --> 05:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
I would prefer
 
05:29:54.708 --> 05:29:54.718 align:start position:0%
I would like an organization that has a
 
05:29:57.830 --> 05:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
record of dealing with millions of
 
05:30:00.110 --> 05:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
federal dollars local dollars our
 
05:30:01.850 --> 05:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars
 
05:30:03.890 --> 05:30:03.900 align:start position:0%
to be overseen by the Department of
 
05:30:05.330 --> 05:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
Education and the Department of
 
05:30:07.850 --> 05:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
Education has a great reputation they
 
05:30:09.708 --> 05:30:09.718 align:start position:0%
have done it well I mean one of the
 
05:30:11.810 --> 05:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
questions that I asked the governor was
 
05:30:14.330 --> 05:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
would he be in favor of it being
 
05:30:16.788 --> 05:30:16.798 align:start position:0%
overseen by the Department of Education
 
05:30:18.948 --> 05:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
and he did not have a problem with it
 
05:30:23.208 --> 05:30:23.218 align:start position:0%
but I really and truly am concerned as I
 
05:30:25.430 --> 05:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
believe you are about the amount of
 
05:30:29.750 --> 05:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
money being overseeing taxpayer money by
 
05:30:33.230 --> 05:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
a private organization thank you
 
05:30:35.510 --> 05:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:30:38.810 --> 05:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um
 
05:30:41.390 --> 05:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
obviously you know there are
 
05:30:44.390 --> 05:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
complexities here again right
 
05:30:47.150 --> 05:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I heard you say
 
05:30:48.590 --> 05:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
was you know 60 million dollars
 
05:30:50.448 --> 05:30:50.458 align:start position:0%
scheduled for the next biennium 10
 
05:30:52.368 --> 05:30:52.378 align:start position:0%
percent is a lot of money and of course
 
05:30:54.230 --> 05:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
it would if there would actually be a
 
05:30:55.970 --> 05:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
need to spend six million dollars to
 
05:30:58.550 --> 05:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
disburse you know
 
05:31:01.070 --> 05:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
60 million dollars my understanding
 
05:31:02.570 --> 05:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
though is that a lot of the initial
 
05:31:04.430 --> 05:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
costs were due to you know the overhead
 
05:31:06.050 --> 05:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
of setting the program up and the
 
05:31:07.730 --> 05:31:07.740 align:start position:0%
operational costs are expected to be
 
05:31:10.190 --> 05:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
much lower going forward have you you
 
05:31:12.948 --> 05:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
know examined those projections or did
 
05:31:14.570 --> 05:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
you look at those numbers in making the
 
05:31:16.070 --> 05:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
case for this bill
 
05:31:18.770 --> 05:31:18.780 align:start position:0%
or would it be just you know you just
 
05:31:20.810 --> 05:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
prefer the doe to do it regardless of
 
05:31:22.430 --> 05:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
whatever the cost of the private
 
05:31:24.890 --> 05:31:24.900 align:start position:0%
organization would be sure no thanks
 
05:31:26.810 --> 05:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
thanks very much for the um for the
 
05:31:26.820 --> 05:31:28.010 align:start position:0%
thanks very much for the um for the
question

05:31:28.010 --> 05:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:31:30.110 --> 05:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I would say that's that's
 
05:31:33.650 --> 05:31:33.660 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a fair question but the
 
05:31:38.030 --> 05:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
um the the the statute in 194f doesn't
 
05:31:40.250 --> 05:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
say that the private organization gets
 
05:31:42.110 --> 05:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
to retain 10 during the formative
 
05:31:44.810 --> 05:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
startup years and then one and a half
 
05:31:47.930 --> 05:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
percent ongoing it says 10 for every
 
05:31:50.330 --> 05:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
year and uh and I think that should
 
05:31:53.510 --> 05:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
raise concerns to uh to all of us who
 
05:31:56.090 --> 05:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
have fiduciary UH responsibilities and
 
05:31:58.368 --> 05:31:58.378 align:start position:0%
certainly uh financial responsibilities
 
05:32:01.250 --> 05:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
to our to our constituents and how their
 
05:32:04.490 --> 05:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
tax dollars are being used and um and so
 
05:32:06.948 --> 05:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
that's really what sparked I think my
 
05:32:11.628 --> 05:32:11.638 align:start position:0%
interest in um uh in in filing this um
 
05:32:16.788 --> 05:32:16.798 align:start position:0%
this legislation uh uh was was really to
 
05:32:21.650 --> 05:32:21.660 align:start position:0%
to you know have have this program uh
 
05:32:23.570 --> 05:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
administered as uh through the
 
05:32:25.910 --> 05:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education as they
 
05:32:29.090 --> 05:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
administer so many other programs that
 
05:32:31.990 --> 05:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
um that are um sort of uh
 
05:32:34.730 --> 05:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
sometimes directly related sometimes
 
05:32:38.628 --> 05:32:38.638 align:start position:0%
adjunct uh related to our to our uh
 
05:32:40.670 --> 05:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
Public School Systems yeah thank you and
 
05:32:43.070 --> 05:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
just to quickly follow up
 
05:32:45.708 --> 05:32:45.718 align:start position:0%
yeah the statute says 10 percent but
 
05:32:49.550 --> 05:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
then there is hb2 so then there is hb2
 
05:32:52.368 --> 05:32:52.378 align:start position:0%
correct correct statutes are a bit
 
05:32:54.050 --> 05:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
flexible when it comes to the finance
 
05:32:56.330 --> 05:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
committee or the other way around so you
 
05:32:57.948 --> 05:32:57.958 align:start position:0%
know those things can be addressed if
 
05:32:59.448 --> 05:32:59.458 align:start position:0%
you know that's the direction that
 
05:33:01.368 --> 05:33:01.378 align:start position:0%
committee feels so it's appropriate I'm
 
05:33:03.050 --> 05:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
not saying that I know what direction a
 
05:33:05.570 --> 05:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
committee wants God knows I'm a freshman
 
05:33:07.910 --> 05:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
my other question is we were just
 
05:33:10.310 --> 05:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
talking earlier when we were going over
 
05:33:12.050 --> 05:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
you know the uh
 
05:33:13.970 --> 05:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
oh I got whichever of the bills and I'm
 
05:33:15.650 --> 05:33:15.660 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor of it that was dealing with
 
05:33:18.590 --> 05:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
a special education in the DHHS you know
 
05:33:21.110 --> 05:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
episode of treatment bills we had a long
 
05:33:22.490 --> 05:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
discussion and one of the things that
 
05:33:25.128 --> 05:33:25.138 align:start position:0%
the HHS was saying was that they were
 
05:33:27.230 --> 05:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
essentially using all outside
 
05:33:29.090 --> 05:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
contractors to manage this for
 
05:33:31.070 --> 05:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility and you know because they
 
05:33:32.810 --> 05:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
can just get exactly what they need and
 
05:33:35.030 --> 05:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
there is there are many times when there
 
05:33:36.890 --> 05:33:36.900 align:start position:0%
is significant relays overhead in using
 
05:33:38.930 --> 05:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
a third party to perform certain
 
05:33:41.570 --> 05:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
services and also relating to this to
 
05:33:43.788 --> 05:33:43.798 align:start position:0%
the comment uh from representative Heath
 
05:33:45.590 --> 05:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
on you know the doe has a lot of
 
05:33:46.850 --> 05:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
expertise on dealing with federal
 
05:33:49.550 --> 05:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
dollars of Education we were just saying
 
05:33:50.810 --> 05:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't really administer
 
05:33:52.850 --> 05:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
education and federal dollars it's just
 
05:33:56.270 --> 05:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
a simple conduit to meet eligibility for
 
05:33:58.070 --> 05:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
a certain Grant and distribute the funds
 
05:33:59.868 --> 05:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
it's a much simpler job than the overall
 
05:33:59.878 --> 05:34:01.128 align:start position:0%
it's a much simpler job than the overall
Doe

05:34:01.128 --> 05:34:01.138 align:start position:0%
Doe
 
05:34:03.890 --> 05:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't you know why why is it that
 
05:34:05.930 --> 05:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
again we are looking at doe when maybe
 
05:34:08.390 --> 05:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know there are options to
 
05:34:11.990 --> 05:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
save money and use a dedicated third
 
05:34:14.150 --> 05:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
party which of course could be put out
 
05:34:15.890 --> 05:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
to bid I mean nobody should have you
 
05:34:18.530 --> 05:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
know a Eternal contract but why not put
 
05:34:20.868 --> 05:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
it out to bid it's a simple job and you
 
05:34:22.670 --> 05:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
know maybe do it for less and don't you
 
05:34:24.530 --> 05:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
know achieve the same results yeah I
 
05:34:27.110 --> 05:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
think that's a very very fair way to um
 
05:34:28.970 --> 05:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
to look at I would not have an objection
 
05:34:33.350 --> 05:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
to to uh to finding a more cost
 
05:34:36.230 --> 05:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
efficient way of of doing that I you
 
05:34:37.850 --> 05:34:37.860 align:start position:0%
know it's just you know I wouldn't
 
05:34:39.410 --> 05:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to want to be
 
05:34:41.628 --> 05:34:41.638 align:start position:0%
duplicative to something we're already
 
05:34:45.230 --> 05:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
funding through the the the state um the
 
05:34:48.288 --> 05:34:48.298 align:start position:0%
state's um Department of Education and
 
05:34:50.448 --> 05:34:50.458 align:start position:0%
and just looking at at the number of
 
05:34:53.150 --> 05:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
students involved here the the state
 
05:34:55.250 --> 05:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
it's it's clearly within the scope of
 
05:34:57.350 --> 05:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
their their capabilities one very quick
 
05:34:59.270 --> 05:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up that was a question I wanted
 
05:35:01.730 --> 05:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
to ask earlier and I should have maybe
 
05:35:03.190 --> 05:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
05:35:05.990 --> 05:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
you um were talking about the number of
 
05:35:07.550 --> 05:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
dollars you know that was spent in the
 
05:35:08.990 --> 05:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
first two years and we are all familiar
 
05:35:11.270 --> 05:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
with the numbers
 
05:35:13.610 --> 05:35:13.620 align:start position:0%
were you mentioning those just to show
 
05:35:17.208 --> 05:35:17.218 align:start position:0%
how the um you know costs exceeded the
 
05:35:20.208 --> 05:35:20.218 align:start position:0%
original forecast or was there a concern
 
05:35:23.510 --> 05:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
that you know had uh the same contract
 
05:35:26.270 --> 05:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
being managed by Doe fewer funds would
 
05:35:28.070 --> 05:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
have been this fewer students would have
 
05:35:29.990 --> 05:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
been approved
 
05:35:30.000 --> 05:35:31.250 align:start position:0%
been approved
um

05:35:31.250 --> 05:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:34.128 --> 05:35:34.138 align:start position:0%
so so I'll try to answer that question I
 
05:35:37.788 --> 05:35:37.798 align:start position:0%
I I think the the fact that the forecast
 
05:35:41.090 --> 05:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
presented two years ago was so far
 
05:35:43.670 --> 05:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
removed from reality
 
05:35:45.430 --> 05:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
um should raise concerns to everybody
 
05:35:49.190 --> 05:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
and and it should want it it should it
 
05:35:51.590 --> 05:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
should compel all of us to try to
 
05:35:54.770 --> 05:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
understand how those forecasts could be
 
05:35:58.430 --> 05:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
so far off and um and honestly that was
 
05:35:59.930 --> 05:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
one of the things that led to the
 
05:36:02.628 --> 05:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
conclusion of uh of filing House Bill
 
05:36:06.050 --> 05:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
430 the prior the last bill that um that
 
05:36:10.490 --> 05:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
that that we had but um but uh but when
 
05:36:13.128 --> 05:36:13.138 align:start position:0%
when when now taking a look at at rather
 
05:36:14.990 --> 05:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
than the forecasts of number of students
 
05:36:17.448 --> 05:36:17.458 align:start position:0%
taking a look at the the forecast of
 
05:36:20.030 --> 05:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
dollars you know there's there's one
 
05:36:23.330 --> 05:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
thing when we talk about you know 10 of
 
05:36:26.270 --> 05:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
139 000 which is what the financial
 
05:36:28.730 --> 05:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
Force forecast was
 
05:36:30.830 --> 05:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
two years ago I mean ten percent is
 
05:36:32.868 --> 05:36:32.878 align:start position:0%
still ten percent don't get me wrong but
 
05:36:35.030 --> 05:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm not gonna lose sleep over
 
05:36:38.208 --> 05:36:38.218 align:start position:0%
fourteen thousand dollars in a in a you
 
05:36:41.090 --> 05:36:41.100 align:start position:0%
know on a I don't know what we're at you
 
05:36:44.150 --> 05:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
know uh you know billions uh state
 
05:36:47.208 --> 05:36:47.218 align:start position:0%
budget 12 billion dollar state budget
 
05:36:50.150 --> 05:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
um uh but uh but when we're when we're
 
05:36:53.090 --> 05:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
talking about you know 60 million
 
05:36:56.090 --> 05:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
dollars over the next biennium yeah can
 
05:36:59.270 --> 05:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
we do better does 10 10 really adding up
 
05:37:02.990 --> 05:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
here so thank you I really appreciate it
 
05:37:05.448 --> 05:37:05.458 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I guess the phrase has
 
05:37:07.070 --> 05:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
been used that this is essentially a
 
05:37:09.250 --> 05:37:09.260 align:start position:0%
pass-through sort of a administrative
 
05:37:12.350 --> 05:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
process and 10 million dollars seems
 
05:37:14.150 --> 05:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
like an awful lot of money for a pass
 
05:37:14.160 --> 05:37:15.350 align:start position:0%
like an awful lot of money for a pass
through

05:37:15.350 --> 05:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:37:15.360 --> 05:37:17.330 align:start position:0%
through
activity

05:37:17.330 --> 05:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
activity
 
05:37:17.340 --> 05:37:18.110 align:start position:0%
activity
um

05:37:18.110 --> 05:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:20.390 --> 05:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
I can Envision an individual person
 
05:37:22.670 --> 05:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
being able to manage the number of
 
05:37:25.070 --> 05:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
students and passing through this this
 
05:37:26.750 --> 05:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
money if it if that's all that's
 
05:37:26.760 --> 05:37:28.190 align:start position:0%
money if it if that's all that's
involved

05:37:28.190 --> 05:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
involved
 
05:37:29.868 --> 05:37:29.878 align:start position:0%
um can you respond to that and also can
 
05:37:32.208 --> 05:37:32.218 align:start position:0%
you ask if Deo has come back to say that
 
05:37:33.890 --> 05:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
yeah we can you know we could create a
 
05:37:36.230 --> 05:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
position it would be far less expensive
 
05:37:39.230 --> 05:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
than 10 million dollars and do they have
 
05:37:42.410 --> 05:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
a sense of how much less it would be
 
05:37:44.628 --> 05:37:44.638 align:start position:0%
so I thank thank you very much
 
05:37:47.330 --> 05:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
representative Murray I don't have uh an
 
05:37:48.470 --> 05:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
answer to
 
05:37:52.368 --> 05:37:52.378 align:start position:0%
um to that question uh but um but we
 
05:37:53.810 --> 05:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
have seen
 
05:37:55.550 --> 05:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
um requests
 
05:37:58.250 --> 05:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
um uh from the department and and bills
 
05:38:00.770 --> 05:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
you know filed over the last um several
 
05:38:03.948 --> 05:38:03.958 align:start position:0%
years to uh to for instance for example
 
05:38:07.550 --> 05:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
hire a um you know a staff member at the
 
05:38:10.788 --> 05:38:10.798 align:start position:0%
uh at New Hampshire education to um
 
05:38:13.910 --> 05:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
to oversee the um the chartered public
 
05:38:13.920 --> 05:38:15.050 align:start position:0%
to oversee the um the chartered public
school

05:38:15.050 --> 05:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:38:17.868 --> 05:38:17.878 align:start position:0%
um uh Charter Public Schools uh in New
 
05:38:20.090 --> 05:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so it's one one person to do
 
05:38:21.890 --> 05:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
that uh I don't know what the total
 
05:38:23.930 --> 05:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
enrollment of Charters are I think we
 
05:38:27.110 --> 05:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
have about 30-ish so so there could be
 
05:38:30.470 --> 05:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere around three thousand
 
05:38:32.570 --> 05:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's not that hot yeah but but it's
 
05:38:35.628 --> 05:38:35.638 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the it's it's not 165 000
 
05:38:38.930 --> 05:38:38.940 align:start position:0%
and and it's not 300 it's somewhere you
 
05:38:42.050 --> 05:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
know uh certainly closer to I think the
 
05:38:46.128 --> 05:38:46.138 align:start position:0%
size of the EFA uh program so so it's
 
05:38:47.930 --> 05:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
not unreasonable to have one person
 
05:38:50.150 --> 05:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
potentially oversee this and have that
 
05:38:52.850 --> 05:38:52.860 align:start position:0%
oversight in the state and available to
 
05:38:55.670 --> 05:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
us more readily yeah I think that's I
 
05:38:57.830 --> 05:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
think that's a reasonable uh reasonable
 
05:39:00.590 --> 05:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
thing and um and possibly
 
05:39:05.150 --> 05:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
um uh have um have a third party that uh
 
05:39:06.948 --> 05:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
that handle you know much like
 
05:39:06.958 --> 05:39:08.750 align:start position:0%
that handle you know much like
businesses

05:39:08.750 --> 05:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
05:39:12.110 --> 05:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh contract with um with with you know
 
05:39:14.628 --> 05:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
have Merchant accounts for to be able to
 
05:39:17.208 --> 05:39:17.218 align:start position:0%
accept credit cards and they pay you
 
05:39:18.650 --> 05:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
know a two percent
 
05:39:20.330 --> 05:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
um you know fee or one and a half
 
05:39:24.470 --> 05:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
percent fee uh uh on on that uh that
 
05:39:26.030 --> 05:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
maybe there's something like that but
 
05:39:28.788 --> 05:39:28.798 align:start position:0%
it's it's certainly far less than I mean
 
05:39:32.330 --> 05:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
it's not even close to the 10 that uh
 
05:39:34.730 --> 05:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
I just asked one final question
 
05:39:34.740 --> 05:39:36.948 align:start position:0%
I just asked one final question
um

05:39:36.948 --> 05:39:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:40.128 --> 05:39:40.138 align:start position:0%
if the department were to take over the
 
05:39:44.448 --> 05:39:44.458 align:start position:0%
administration of the efas
 
05:39:46.610 --> 05:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
would it be possible for them to
 
05:39:49.730 --> 05:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
contract with the current agency
 
05:39:53.448 --> 05:39:53.458 align:start position:0%
for which the department then would
 
05:39:56.868 --> 05:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
oversee hopefully there'd be an RFP and
 
05:39:59.150 --> 05:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
then they would oversee the contract
 
05:40:02.030 --> 05:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
and on that basis would that make a
 
05:40:02.040 --> 05:40:03.110 align:start position:0%
and on that basis would that make a
difference

05:40:03.110 --> 05:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
difference
 
05:40:05.448 --> 05:40:05.458 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks I I mean there's certainly
 
05:40:07.550 --> 05:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
nothing in this nothing in 626 that
 
05:40:10.430 --> 05:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
would prevent that from from happening I
 
05:40:12.890 --> 05:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
think that would be a conversation that
 
05:40:14.930 --> 05:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
that the the contractor would have to
 
05:40:17.690 --> 05:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
have with the uh with the Department to
 
05:40:19.610 --> 05:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
see if that makes Financial Cent
 
05:40:23.230 --> 05:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
business sense uh for them uh and and
 
05:40:25.850 --> 05:40:25.860 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think that would be something
 
05:40:28.490 --> 05:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
that certainly could be considered
 
05:40:32.390 --> 05:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
but right now if we pass if since 26
 
05:40:35.510 --> 05:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
passes it's not funded
 
05:40:37.850 --> 05:40:37.860 align:start position:0%
it's not I
 
05:40:40.490 --> 05:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
I didn't I mean I
 
05:40:42.230 --> 05:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
looking through this bill that doesn't
 
05:40:44.208 --> 05:40:44.218 align:start position:0%
have any funding methods there's no
 
05:40:46.250 --> 05:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
appropriation in this in this in this
 
05:40:49.128 --> 05:40:49.138 align:start position:0%
bill uh this is strictly on the policy
 
05:40:49.138 --> 05:40:50.570 align:start position:0%
bill uh this is strictly on the policy
side

05:40:50.570 --> 05:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
side
 
05:40:53.090 --> 05:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
um of uh of the department administering
 
05:40:55.190 --> 05:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
the program that there's you know I
 
05:40:56.628 --> 05:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
think there's another
 
05:40:58.550 --> 05:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
um there's another piece of this that's
 
05:41:01.070 --> 05:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's you know worth you know
 
05:41:07.670 --> 05:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:09.650 --> 05:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what you know for
 
05:41:13.128 --> 05:41:13.138 align:start position:0%
for the in the first year of the program
 
05:41:15.590 --> 05:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
um 2021
 
05:41:15.600 --> 05:41:18.708 align:start position:0%
um 2021
uh

05:41:18.708 --> 05:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:20.930 --> 05:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
I think it was close to nine million
 
05:41:25.128 --> 05:41:25.138 align:start position:0%
dollars of of taxpayer money this is the
 
05:41:27.948 --> 05:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
report that we get oh okay you know I
 
05:41:29.448 --> 05:41:29.458 align:start position:0%
thought you were looking at this no no
 
05:41:31.788 --> 05:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
no no no no no this is this is the
 
05:41:34.910 --> 05:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
report that that we got from the uh from
 
05:41:37.970 --> 05:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
the private contractor and um and I'm
 
05:41:40.368 --> 05:41:40.378 align:start position:0%
not even sure what to what to tell from
 
05:41:43.490 --> 05:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
from the report how how useful it is uh
 
05:41:45.770 --> 05:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the one of the things
 
05:41:47.930 --> 05:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
that that I think we would have better
 
05:41:51.350 --> 05:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
oversight as a legislature is if the um
 
05:41:53.810 --> 05:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
if the Department of Education were to
 
05:41:55.730 --> 05:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
what were to have the details not
 
05:41:57.948 --> 05:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
looking for student specific stuff I
 
05:42:00.770 --> 05:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
don't think that's we we don't get that
 
05:42:03.470 --> 05:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
from from the Department of Education
 
05:42:05.510 --> 05:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
now we certainly don't get it from HHS
 
05:42:08.030 --> 05:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
you know that's not the that's not where
 
05:42:11.270 --> 05:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
where we're at but um but making sure
 
05:42:12.590 --> 05:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:42:14.750 --> 05:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
that that the program's being run
 
05:42:18.350 --> 05:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
responsibly that uh that there's no uh
 
05:42:22.490 --> 05:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh evidence of fraud as has been seen in
 
05:42:24.110 --> 05:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
other states and the commissioner of
 
05:42:27.170 --> 05:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
Education said it on WMUR several weeks
 
05:42:27.180 --> 05:42:28.128 align:start position:0%
Education said it on WMUR several weeks
ago

05:42:28.128 --> 05:42:28.138 align:start position:0%
ago
 
05:42:30.708 --> 05:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
um uh that that other states have
 
05:42:32.628 --> 05:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
experienced fraud
 
05:42:35.150 --> 05:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
um in the program and uh and we really
 
05:42:38.448 --> 05:42:38.458 align:start position:0%
just don't have uh safeguards in the um
 
05:42:42.650 --> 05:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
in the uh statute right now to uh to
 
05:42:46.010 --> 05:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
help prevent that so this is one of
 
05:42:49.128 --> 05:42:49.138 align:start position:0%
those guardrail bills to uh uh to help
 
05:42:52.250 --> 05:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
prevent that and um and there's there's
 
05:42:55.368 --> 05:42:55.378 align:start position:0%
a couple others too that um you know
 
05:42:57.770 --> 05:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
that would additionally be able to to
 
05:43:00.050 --> 05:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
help prevent fraud in the program and
 
05:43:01.430 --> 05:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not and I'm not making any
 
05:43:04.490 --> 05:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
accusations of of fraud I don't have any
 
05:43:06.590 --> 05:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
evidence to say those been fraud other
 
05:43:09.050 --> 05:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
than that that this has happened in
 
05:43:11.208 --> 05:43:11.218 align:start position:0%
other states and I don't have any reason
 
05:43:12.590 --> 05:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
to believe that New Hampshire would be
 
05:43:16.070 --> 05:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
be somehow magically immune to that
 
05:43:18.230 --> 05:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
since the 10 is already being funded out
 
05:43:20.090 --> 05:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
of the appropriation to the EFA wouldn't
 
05:43:21.890 --> 05:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
this position also be funded out of the
 
05:43:23.990 --> 05:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the EFA in terms of
 
05:43:25.430 --> 05:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
the funding it's not that we would have
 
05:43:27.650 --> 05:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
an additional funding forward it's just
 
05:43:29.390 --> 05:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
the funding would come out of the EFA
 
05:43:31.430 --> 05:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation like it is now it would
 
05:43:34.010 --> 05:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
just go to
 
05:43:36.110 --> 05:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
I would have to say it would have to
 
05:43:39.350 --> 05:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
appear somewhere to say that
 
05:43:41.868 --> 05:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
well you could I mean that I think
 
05:43:43.670 --> 05:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's I representative Murray I think
 
05:43:46.010 --> 05:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
you've got a good point there that that
 
05:43:49.910 --> 05:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
the current statute calls for 10 to fund
 
05:43:51.890 --> 05:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
the uh the administration of the program
 
05:43:54.590 --> 05:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
and that it could be taken out of those
 
05:43:56.628 --> 05:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
funds or it could be taking out of other
 
05:43:58.730 --> 05:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
operating funds that the that the
 
05:44:01.190 --> 05:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
department you know uh requests and has
 
05:44:03.530 --> 05:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
appropriated so I I mean I think that's
 
05:44:06.770 --> 05:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
you know this is like I said 676 I think
 
05:44:10.850 --> 05:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
is a policy Bill and um and and finance
 
05:44:12.890 --> 05:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
Finance Finance is finally I think it's
 
05:44:15.530 --> 05:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
a great way to look at it so any other
 
05:44:15.540 --> 05:44:16.610 align:start position:0%
a great way to look at it so any other
questions

05:44:16.610 --> 05:44:16.620 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:44:19.010 --> 05:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
but I want to recess this until we have
 
05:44:21.288 --> 05:44:21.298 align:start position:0%
a full committee great thank you very
 
05:44:23.448 --> 05:44:23.458 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair members of the committee
 
05:44:26.868 --> 05:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:29.390 --> 05:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
that's all right
 
05:44:33.708 --> 05:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
so we will we can be so briefly we we
 
05:44:35.390 --> 05:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
did schedule a budget work session for
 
05:44:37.150 --> 05:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
now so we are permissible to talk about
 
05:44:39.410 --> 05:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
issues I will say the Department of
 
05:44:41.270 --> 05:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
Education had some information on a
 
05:44:42.590 --> 05:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
couple of the earlier bills that they
 
05:44:44.390 --> 05:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to just share before they left
 
05:44:46.490 --> 05:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
today so Market asked or just a moment
 
05:44:52.070 --> 05:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:32.448 --> 05:45:32.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:35.030 --> 05:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
so I for the record marketing hello
 
05:45:37.190 --> 05:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
Bureau of school finance department of
 
05:45:39.890 --> 05:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
education I just have a memo I know I
 
05:45:41.090 --> 05:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
know you've done a lot of work on a lot
 
05:45:43.010 --> 05:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
of different adequacy bills today I just
 
05:45:44.570 --> 05:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
want to run through
 
05:45:46.610 --> 05:45:46.620 align:start position:0%
um a few key things that I just want to
 
05:45:49.670 --> 05:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
point out that was not did not come up
 
05:45:53.330 --> 05:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
um so just to discuss a little bit about
 
05:45:55.490 --> 05:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
the adequacy estimate process a lot of
 
05:45:57.350 --> 05:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
numbers are going around
 
05:45:58.850 --> 05:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
um sometimes when we do an adequacy
 
05:46:00.410 --> 05:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
estimate we don't do the full quality
 
05:46:01.910 --> 05:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
control so sometimes the number just
 
05:46:04.430 --> 05:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
gets thrown out there and really what I
 
05:46:06.288 --> 05:46:06.298 align:start position:0%
think the when doing school funding
 
05:46:07.250 --> 05:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
formula you have a lot of different
 
05:46:09.830 --> 05:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
bills in front of you as you sort of
 
05:46:11.690 --> 05:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
narrow in on an idea that this committee
 
05:46:12.830 --> 05:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
is really interested in because you've
 
05:46:14.150 --> 05:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
got a lot of different bills that you're
 
05:46:15.590 --> 05:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
05:46:17.628 --> 05:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
um uh Mickey will likely just throw
 
05:46:19.250 --> 05:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
numbers out there and the department
 
05:46:20.570 --> 05:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
might just throw numbers out there we're
 
05:46:21.770 --> 05:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
not going to fully quality control them
 
05:46:23.510 --> 05:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
as you sort of hone in on the policy you
 
05:46:25.430 --> 05:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
like that will give us as you tell
 
05:46:26.990 --> 05:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
Mickey and I it will give us more time
 
05:46:28.430 --> 05:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
to really vet those numbers out and make
 
05:46:29.868 --> 05:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
sure we're really confident in the
 
05:46:30.650 --> 05:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
number you're going to put into your
 
05:46:32.690 --> 05:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
budget so I have a little disclaimer on
 
05:46:34.490 --> 05:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
some of these numbers
 
05:46:36.470 --> 05:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
the only things I'd like to bring up is
 
05:46:39.948 --> 05:46:39.958 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 272 just pointing it out
 
05:46:42.170 --> 05:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
um I think it was in the fiscal this
 
05:46:43.788 --> 05:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
Bill had a fiscal known it was a man did
 
05:46:45.830 --> 05:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
the price tag has now dropped down to
 
05:46:48.288 --> 05:46:48.298 align:start position:0%
4.9 million so it's a little cheaper
 
05:46:50.810 --> 05:46:50.820 align:start position:0%
than as it was introduced just pointing
 
05:46:52.310 --> 05:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
out that this does not include the
 
05:46:53.810 --> 05:46:53.820 align:start position:0%
virtual Learning Academy Charter School
 
05:46:56.570 --> 05:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to include that into the
 
05:47:00.470 --> 05:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
bill it would cost about 1.2 1.9 million
 
05:47:02.690 --> 05:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
a year just pointing that out to fund
 
05:47:02.700 --> 05:47:03.788 align:start position:0%
a year just pointing that out to fund
vlax

05:47:03.788 --> 05:47:03.798 align:start position:0%
vlax
 
05:47:06.170 --> 05:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
to give them the same additional Grant
 
05:47:08.150 --> 05:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
Aid you're going to give a non-v-lax
 
05:47:10.610 --> 05:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
charter so just pointing that out making
 
05:47:13.510 --> 05:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
sure it's known with House Bill 529
 
05:47:17.150 --> 05:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative fellows bill as we talked
 
05:47:20.628 --> 05:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
about uh the bill as introduced was 95.8
 
05:47:20.638 --> 05:47:21.948 align:start position:0%
about uh the bill as introduced was 95.8
Million

05:47:21.948 --> 05:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
Million
 
05:47:24.230 --> 05:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
um if you were to merge it into the
 
05:47:26.448 --> 05:47:26.458 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal as the governor's
 
05:47:28.670 --> 05:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
presented uh his proposal
 
05:47:30.048 --> 05:47:30.058 align:start position:0%
um I think the cost is I plugged that
 
05:47:31.970 --> 05:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
number into our spreadsheet 36 million
 
05:47:33.410 --> 05:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
and that's because a lot of that
 
05:47:35.208 --> 05:47:35.218 align:start position:0%
additional ladies getting eaten up by
 
05:47:37.010 --> 05:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
the hold harmless so it's netting
 
05:47:39.708 --> 05:47:39.718 align:start position:0%
against the Holt harmless
 
05:47:41.868 --> 05:47:41.878 align:start position:0%
making the hold harmless Grant smaller
 
05:47:43.850 --> 05:47:43.860 align:start position:0%
so making it cheaper on that end but
 
05:47:45.670 --> 05:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
increasing eight over here
 
05:47:48.590 --> 05:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
so the the cost there is 36 million
 
05:47:51.650 --> 05:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
rough number again disclaimer out there
 
05:47:54.948 --> 05:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
um the they're also Senate Bill uh not
 
05:47:57.350 --> 05:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill sorry House Bill 529 was
 
05:47:59.868 --> 05:47:59.878 align:start position:0%
amended and the department hasn't had a
 
05:48:01.850 --> 05:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
lot of time to assess this amendment but
 
05:48:03.708 --> 05:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
it added an accountability requirement
 
05:48:05.690 --> 05:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
to this grant so similar to the
 
05:48:07.430 --> 05:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
accountability requirement that's in
 
05:48:09.770 --> 05:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 420 uh last year's last
 
05:48:11.750 --> 05:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
session that added an accountability
 
05:48:14.030 --> 05:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
requirement requirement to the
 
05:48:16.670 --> 05:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant House Bill 529
 
05:48:18.590 --> 05:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
also adds an accountability requirement
 
05:48:20.270 --> 05:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
I think I have a question from
 
05:48:22.970 --> 05:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative right I'm looking at this
 
05:48:25.730 --> 05:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
uh handout we had in the governor's aide
 
05:48:30.470 --> 05:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
after hold harmless was 653 million and
 
05:48:33.948 --> 05:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
change and uh the current RSA plus 529
 
05:48:37.970 --> 05:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
is 694. that difference is 41 million
 
05:48:40.610 --> 05:48:40.620 align:start position:0%
how where I I'm not I'm having a hard
 
05:48:42.170 --> 05:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
time understanding what you're saying
 
05:48:44.090 --> 05:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
I'm saying 36 million and I actually
 
05:48:45.470 --> 05:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
have not investigated what that
 
05:48:47.208 --> 05:48:47.218 align:start position:0%
discrepancies discrepancy is it could be
 
05:48:49.610 --> 05:48:49.620 align:start position:0%
an excess sweat thing it could be there
 
05:48:51.890 --> 05:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
could be another aspect of it um I did
 
05:48:53.570 --> 05:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
my math really quick you're doing quick
 
05:48:56.270 --> 05:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
math as well one of us is both of us
 
05:48:57.948 --> 05:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
could be wrong both of us could not both
 
05:48:59.570 --> 05:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
of us can't be right it's the aggregate
 
05:49:01.250 --> 05:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
I mean you know I'm not you know five
 
05:49:02.448 --> 05:49:02.458 align:start position:0%
million hell what the hell is five
 
05:49:04.970 --> 05:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
million yep I mean when you're doing
 
05:49:07.670 --> 05:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
this much money it's it's not a big I
 
05:49:09.410 --> 05:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
think we're hand grenade closer yeah
 
05:49:11.390 --> 05:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
05:49:14.030 --> 05:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's right Army talk so if you if you
 
05:49:17.390 --> 05:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
really like 529 and you want to blend it
 
05:49:19.310 --> 05:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
into the governor's formula you like the
 
05:49:21.650 --> 05:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
governor's formula like 529
 
05:49:23.510 --> 05:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
um we're talking in the ballpark of 40
 
05:49:26.448 --> 05:49:26.458 align:start position:0%
million um have Mickey really look at
 
05:49:27.770 --> 05:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
the numbers carefully and Mickey can
 
05:49:28.970 --> 05:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
work with the department and we can
 
05:49:31.788 --> 05:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
really become confident in the numbers I
 
05:49:33.770 --> 05:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
just so added two columns to the
 
05:49:35.208 --> 05:49:35.218 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet for the governors and I just
 
05:49:37.010 --> 05:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
threw in representative fellows numbers
 
05:49:39.470 --> 05:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
and and I probably didn't go through a
 
05:49:40.788 --> 05:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
full method I was doing it quickly
 
05:49:42.170 --> 05:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
because I was doing a lot of estimates
 
05:49:44.750 --> 05:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
here uh Mickey was uh Mickey was curious
 
05:49:46.070 --> 05:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
about how all these bills would match
 
05:49:48.048 --> 05:49:48.058 align:start position:0%
with the governor's uh formula so I did
 
05:49:49.910 --> 05:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
some quick math or some quick
 
05:49:51.708 --> 05:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet moving around could be an
 
05:49:53.448 --> 05:49:53.458 align:start position:0%
error in my spreadsheet
 
05:49:54.590 --> 05:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
um it could be a four million dollar
 
05:49:57.650 --> 05:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
error easily but does happen
 
05:49:58.850 --> 05:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
um but just giving you ballpark figure
 
05:50:00.230 --> 05:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking about those numbers I
 
05:50:01.970 --> 05:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
don't know the exact reason why we have
 
05:50:01.980 --> 05:50:04.368 align:start position:0%
don't know the exact reason why we have
discrepancies

05:50:04.368 --> 05:50:04.378 align:start position:0%
discrepancies
 
05:50:05.690 --> 05:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
um another thing I want to point out
 
05:50:07.970 --> 05:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
about House Bill 529 uh the the
 
05:50:10.190 --> 05:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
accountability component so just looking
 
05:50:11.810 --> 05:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
at some of the language about the with
 
05:50:13.430 --> 05:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
the accountability amendment that was
 
05:50:15.230 --> 05:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
added there seems to be a technical
 
05:50:18.230 --> 05:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
error for example that Amendment seems
 
05:50:22.788 --> 05:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
to reference RSA 194 41A that's
 
05:50:24.530 --> 05:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
um an error it should be I believe it
 
05:50:26.690 --> 05:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
should be RSA 198 so I think there's a
 
05:50:29.030 --> 05:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
technical error there another potential
 
05:50:31.490 --> 05:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
technical technical error with the
 
05:50:34.128 --> 05:50:34.138 align:start position:0%
accountability plans is
 
05:50:35.868 --> 05:50:35.878 align:start position:0%
there's the extraordinary needs Grant
 
05:50:37.128 --> 05:50:37.138 align:start position:0%
which requires an accountability plan
 
05:50:40.190 --> 05:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
under current law then there's 529 as
 
05:50:42.830 --> 05:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
amended that incl that also requires an
 
05:50:44.868 --> 05:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
accountability plan but those are now we
 
05:50:47.270 --> 05:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
have three grants but I'm not sure how
 
05:50:48.830 --> 05:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
many accountability plans we have do we
 
05:50:50.570 --> 05:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
have one accountability plan do we have
 
05:50:51.890 --> 05:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
two accountability plans or do we have
 
05:50:53.510 --> 05:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
three accountability plans so I would
 
05:50:55.490 --> 05:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
like the committee to make that clear if
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
the department were to implement
 
05:50:59.990 --> 05:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
529 as amended I need to know how many
 
05:51:01.850 --> 05:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
accountability plans I'm uh we are going
 
05:51:04.490 --> 05:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
to require of the districts so um could
 
05:51:05.868 --> 05:51:05.878 align:start position:0%
a district submit one accountability
 
05:51:07.868 --> 05:51:07.878 align:start position:0%
plan if they receive all three grants
 
05:51:10.070 --> 05:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
additional F and raid
 
05:51:12.350 --> 05:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity a and
 
05:51:13.910 --> 05:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant do they submit
 
05:51:15.708 --> 05:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
one accountability plan or do they
 
05:51:18.230 --> 05:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
submit three or do they submit one that
 
05:51:20.208 --> 05:51:20.218 align:start position:0%
covers the additional fnr Aid and the
 
05:51:22.010 --> 05:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity just just
 
05:51:23.868 --> 05:51:23.878 align:start position:0%
clarify that if that's the if that's the
 
05:51:27.470 --> 05:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:28.610 --> 05:51:28.620 align:start position:0%
um another thing with accountability
 
05:51:31.250 --> 05:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
plans this is just I'm just alerting you
 
05:51:32.810 --> 05:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
we've now we've now done accountability
 
05:51:34.490 --> 05:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
plans for one year we did accountability
 
05:51:36.410 --> 05:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
plans for Extraordinary needs Grant some
 
05:51:38.270 --> 05:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
of the things we're learning
 
05:51:40.368 --> 05:51:40.378 align:start position:0%
um I probably had about 40 phone calls
 
05:51:41.930 --> 05:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
with school districts when the
 
05:51:44.868 --> 05:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
accountability plan uh law was passed
 
05:51:47.570 --> 05:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of confusion out there
 
05:51:49.368 --> 05:51:49.378 align:start position:0%
adequacy is designed to be an
 
05:51:51.048 --> 05:51:51.058 align:start position:0%
unrestricted aid program
 
05:51:52.730 --> 05:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
to think of that if you were to make
 
05:51:54.410 --> 05:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
adequacy restricted you would need to
 
05:51:56.570 --> 05:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
redesign the adequacy grant because I
 
05:51:58.310 --> 05:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
pay it on a distribution basis I don't
 
05:52:00.350 --> 05:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
pay it on restricted grants are based on
 
05:52:02.990 --> 05:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
a reimbursement basement so for me to
 
05:52:04.430 --> 05:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
make it restricted I would have to say
 
05:52:06.350 --> 05:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
show me with documentation that you
 
05:52:08.330 --> 05:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
spent it for this service if you show me
 
05:52:09.650 --> 05:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
the documentation it was spent for the
 
05:52:11.270 --> 05:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
service I'll release the money that's
 
05:52:13.910 --> 05:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
how almost all grants work adequacy is
 
05:52:15.470 --> 05:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
not designed to be a restricted Grant we
 
05:52:17.090 --> 05:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
don't have the staff to make it a
 
05:52:18.530 --> 05:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
restricted Grant it's always designed to
 
05:52:20.208 --> 05:52:20.218 align:start position:0%
be unrestricted and essentially
 
05:52:21.890 --> 05:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
underwrites whatever the school
 
05:52:23.030 --> 05:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
districts are providing they're
 
05:52:25.010 --> 05:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
providing by law inadequate education
 
05:52:27.590 --> 05:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
and adequacy underwrites that so
 
05:52:30.230 --> 05:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
basically is uh It underwrites Whatever
 
05:52:32.510 --> 05:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers have to pay so it's always
 
05:52:36.230 --> 05:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
used as a a support to the taxpayers the
 
05:52:38.570 --> 05:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are required to implement an
 
05:52:42.048 --> 05:52:42.058 align:start position:0%
adequate education inadequacy just backs
 
05:52:44.990 --> 05:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
backfills that so that's how the program
 
05:52:47.150 --> 05:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
is designed
 
05:52:50.570 --> 05:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
there's a disturbing Trend where we see
 
05:52:54.048 --> 05:52:54.058 align:start position:0%
the school enrollments going down but we
 
05:52:57.048 --> 05:52:57.058 align:start position:0%
keep adding more employees for
 
05:52:59.750 --> 05:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
non-teaching staff is there some
 
05:53:04.030 --> 05:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
accountability for all this increase in
 
05:53:04.040 --> 05:53:05.990 align:start position:0%
accountability for all this increase in
employees

05:53:05.990 --> 05:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
employees
 
05:53:09.708 --> 05:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
is that does the 25e take care of that
 
05:53:15.110 --> 05:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
or so there's there's uh no uh there's
 
05:53:18.410 --> 05:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
no requirement in RSA or sorry not RSA
 
05:53:21.590 --> 05:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill 529 that districts account
 
05:53:23.690 --> 05:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
for declining enrollment and how they
 
05:53:25.368 --> 05:53:25.378 align:start position:0%
manage their resources in the face of
 
05:53:27.288 --> 05:53:27.298 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment there's no mandated
 
05:53:29.628 --> 05:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
requirement in that accountability plan
 
05:53:31.788 --> 05:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
no the puzzling thing is why do you keep
 
05:53:33.650 --> 05:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
adding employees while you're losing
 
05:53:33.660 --> 05:53:35.448 align:start position:0%
adding employees while you're losing
enrollment

05:53:35.448 --> 05:53:35.458 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
05:53:38.090 --> 05:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
that's that is a there's
 
05:53:39.890 --> 05:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
um I don't have I'm not really I don't
 
05:53:41.628 --> 05:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
really look at the employment data but
 
05:53:43.010 --> 05:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
um there is declining enrollment for
 
05:53:45.650 --> 05:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
sure and there's increased cost for sure
 
05:53:47.750 --> 05:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
and some of it is a non-teaching staff
 
05:53:51.048 --> 05:53:51.058 align:start position:0%
so I think maybe we need something in
 
05:53:53.090 --> 05:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
legislation to say give us an
 
05:53:53.100 --> 05:53:54.830 align:start position:0%
legislation to say give us an
explanation

05:53:54.830 --> 05:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
05:53:56.990 --> 05:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
that would be um that you could go that
 
05:54:02.990 --> 05:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:04.670 --> 05:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
um another thing with uh accountability
 
05:54:06.170 --> 05:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
plans is
 
05:54:06.180 --> 05:54:07.610 align:start position:0%
plans is
um

05:54:07.610 --> 05:54:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:09.350 --> 05:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
once you start dealing with assessment
 
05:54:11.150 --> 05:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
data student assessment data that is
 
05:54:14.448 --> 05:54:14.458 align:start position:0%
private information so if we have
 
05:54:17.590 --> 05:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
schools discussing about particular
 
05:54:20.510 --> 05:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
classrooms small schools and particular
 
05:54:22.030 --> 05:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
classrooms where they would like to
 
05:54:24.110 --> 05:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
approve outcomes
 
05:54:25.670 --> 05:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
we have an issue with making that
 
05:54:26.868 --> 05:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
transparent because that could
 
05:54:30.070 --> 05:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
potentially disclose the um the the
 
05:54:32.628 --> 05:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
educational performance of a student so
 
05:54:34.310 --> 05:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
it is a challenge with accountability so
 
05:54:35.868 --> 05:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
just making you aware of that that is a
 
05:54:37.250 --> 05:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
natural challenge when it comes to
 
05:54:39.590 --> 05:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
accountability so accountability through
 
05:54:41.810 --> 05:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
transparency it has to be done in this
 
05:54:43.250 --> 05:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
rolled up basis it can't really be done
 
05:54:45.230 --> 05:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
on this granular basis because then you
 
05:54:46.868 --> 05:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
risk identifying the students
 
05:54:49.610 --> 05:54:49.620 align:start position:0%
educational performance so just a
 
05:54:51.650 --> 05:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
challenge to keep you in mind as you
 
05:54:53.868 --> 05:54:53.878 align:start position:0%
think about accountability I think we
 
05:54:55.970 --> 05:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
are having that issue when we tell
 
05:54:57.708 --> 05:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
districts to give us your accountability
 
05:54:59.270 --> 05:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
plan and then they give us an
 
05:55:00.890 --> 05:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
accountability plan that we basically
 
05:55:02.810 --> 05:55:02.820 align:start position:0%
can never be make public because it
 
05:55:04.868 --> 05:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
would potentially disclose the
 
05:55:07.548 --> 05:55:07.558 align:start position:0%
educational performance of a student so
 
05:55:09.170 --> 05:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
just something we've come across to
 
05:55:10.788 --> 05:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
we're one year into implementing
 
05:55:12.530 --> 05:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant accountability
 
05:55:14.090 --> 05:55:14.100 align:start position:0%
plans and that's
 
05:55:17.390 --> 05:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
um some of the things we're learning
 
05:55:18.948 --> 05:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
let's see how to see if I have any other
 
05:55:20.810 --> 05:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
things I want to mention I think I'm
 
05:55:22.190 --> 05:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
covering all the bases here and you have
 
05:55:24.410 --> 05:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
I have my memo I'm going to bring up um
 
05:55:27.410 --> 05:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
uh Kelly Rambo in a second
 
05:55:27.420 --> 05:55:28.670 align:start position:0%
uh Kelly Rambo in a second
um

05:55:28.670 --> 05:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:32.448 --> 05:55:32.458 align:start position:0%
last thing on House Bill 540 uh this the
 
05:55:34.788 --> 05:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
changes to this uh sped differential Aid
 
05:55:36.830 --> 05:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative lad's Bill to put into
 
05:55:38.990 --> 05:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
three buckets
 
05:55:41.330 --> 05:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
three things about our one thing about
 
05:55:43.670 --> 05:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
that is that requires a whole new data
 
05:55:46.368 --> 05:55:46.378 align:start position:0%
set for us to merge with our existing
 
05:55:48.230 --> 05:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
adequacy data set
 
05:55:51.708 --> 05:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
it's not impossible we have the data but
 
05:55:53.510 --> 05:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
it might be unreasonable to ask the
 
05:55:54.830 --> 05:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
department to
 
05:55:58.128 --> 05:55:58.138 align:start position:0%
for you to pass this in law make this go
 
05:56:00.410 --> 05:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
effective July 1 and then we have to
 
05:56:02.030 --> 05:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
scramble all summer long to make sure
 
05:56:04.788 --> 05:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
the data is reliable and blended into
 
05:56:07.250 --> 05:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
our existing systems we we can probably
 
05:56:08.868 --> 05:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
do it because you ask us to do something
 
05:56:10.970 --> 05:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
we'll get it done
 
05:56:12.890 --> 05:56:12.900 align:start position:0%
um you know via law we'll comply with
 
05:56:15.770 --> 05:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
the law but it's a it's a heavy ask for
 
05:56:17.208 --> 05:56:17.218 align:start position:0%
our department to make this in the
 
05:56:19.430 --> 05:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 formula so it would make
 
05:56:21.170 --> 05:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
more sense for you to make it in the
 
05:56:23.628 --> 05:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 formula then we have a
 
05:56:25.670 --> 05:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
little bit more time to work with our
 
05:56:27.288 --> 05:56:27.298 align:start position:0%
data processes to make sure the sped
 
05:56:29.750 --> 05:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
data can come in exactly how it needs to
 
05:56:32.208 --> 05:56:32.218 align:start position:0%
come in we have time to work with the
 
05:56:33.350 --> 05:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
calculation to make sure we don't make
 
05:56:35.270 --> 05:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
an error because what happens in when
 
05:56:38.330 --> 05:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
you pass the budget we have to Now set
 
05:56:40.310 --> 05:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
adequacy it's a new adequacy formula if
 
05:56:42.350 --> 05:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
you do a new adequacy formula we have to
 
05:56:44.570 --> 05:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
set it in fiscal year 24 and that number
 
05:56:46.250 --> 05:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
is going to be used to set tax rates and
 
05:56:49.430 --> 05:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
so any error we make between July 1 when
 
05:56:51.288 --> 05:56:51.298 align:start position:0%
you pass the budget and not in September
 
05:56:53.330 --> 05:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
1st when we start using revenues for
 
05:56:56.690 --> 05:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
taxes if we don't fix it or resolve it
 
05:56:58.970 --> 05:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
or we make an error basically taxes will
 
05:57:01.548 --> 05:57:01.558 align:start position:0%
be messed up so this is a little bit
 
05:57:02.990 --> 05:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
complicated so we'd like to have a
 
05:57:04.970 --> 05:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
little bit of leeway to look at this
 
05:57:08.570 --> 05:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
data and blend it into our systems for
 
05:57:10.910 --> 05:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 25 formula so just a
 
05:57:12.770 --> 05:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
request for me personally so I don't
 
05:57:17.030 --> 05:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:20.090 --> 05:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
um and then also uh
 
05:57:23.208 --> 05:57:23.218 align:start position:0%
bringing in 540 I think the the as
 
05:57:25.430 --> 05:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
introduced it's 19.8 million rolling
 
05:57:27.288 --> 05:57:27.298 align:start position:0%
into the governor's formula for fiscal
 
05:57:28.448 --> 05:57:28.458 align:start position:0%
year 25
 
05:57:31.310 --> 05:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
12.17 million uh Mickey has all these
 
05:57:33.170 --> 05:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
numbers so um as you kind of pick and
 
05:57:34.490 --> 05:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
choose which formulas you like don't
 
05:57:34.500 --> 05:57:35.390 align:start position:0%
choose which formulas you like don't
like

05:57:35.390 --> 05:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:57:37.010 --> 05:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
um that's the option you'll have if you
 
05:57:38.690 --> 05:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
choose to roll it into the governor's
 
05:57:38.700 --> 05:57:40.368 align:start position:0%
choose to roll it into the governor's
formula

05:57:40.368 --> 05:57:40.378 align:start position:0%
formula
 
05:57:41.510 --> 05:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
um I want to talk a little bit about
 
05:57:43.730 --> 05:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
House Bill 601 I don't know if Kelly can
 
05:57:45.230 --> 05:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
come up
 
05:57:47.690 --> 05:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 601 is Medicaid direct
 
05:57:47.700 --> 05:57:49.190 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 601 is Medicaid direct
cert

05:57:49.190 --> 05:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
cert
 
05:57:51.230 --> 05:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
um so as you know house Medicaid direct
 
05:57:53.030 --> 05:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
cert involves our food and nutrition
 
05:57:55.310 --> 05:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
program I'm going to talk about how it
 
05:57:57.288 --> 05:57:57.298 align:start position:0%
impacts adequacy and then I'll uh Kelly
 
05:57:59.270 --> 05:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
Rambo talk about how it impacts uh the
 
05:58:01.070 --> 05:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
food and nutrition program
 
05:58:03.530 --> 05:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
so a couple things about Medicaid direct
 
05:58:03.540 --> 05:58:04.628 align:start position:0%
so a couple things about Medicaid direct
cert

05:58:04.628 --> 05:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
cert
 
05:58:06.830 --> 05:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
as we've talked about
 
05:58:09.530 --> 05:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
this will increase our fnr numbers by an
 
05:58:11.810 --> 05:58:11.820 align:start position:0%
unknown amount if we start directly
 
05:58:14.270 --> 05:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
certifying students for fnr using the
 
05:58:17.330 --> 05:58:17.340 align:start position:0%
Medicaid data this will have an unknown
 
05:58:19.970 --> 05:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
cost to adequacy ranging from between 22
 
05:58:23.150 --> 05:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
million to 42 million in fiscal year 26
 
05:58:24.530 --> 05:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
if everything goes according to plan
 
05:58:26.530 --> 05:58:26.540 align:start position:0%
meaning you enact a Medicaid direct cert
 
05:58:30.230 --> 05:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
we uh uh go through the USDA processes
 
05:58:32.510 --> 05:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
we get that we do the data sharing with
 
05:58:35.288 --> 05:58:35.298 align:start position:0%
DHHS everything gets implemented
 
05:58:38.750 --> 05:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
a cost of around 22 million to 42
 
05:58:40.430 --> 05:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
million I think it's on the lower end I
 
05:58:43.128 --> 05:58:43.138 align:start position:0%
think it's gonna be closer to 22 million
 
05:58:44.628 --> 05:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
um I think the 42 million is an inflated
 
05:58:46.850 --> 05:58:46.860 align:start position:0%
number because right now Medicaid
 
05:58:48.830 --> 05:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
enrollment is inflated because no one's
 
05:58:50.208 --> 05:58:50.218 align:start position:0%
been kicked off the rolls because of the
 
05:58:50.218 --> 05:58:52.610 align:start position:0%
been kicked off the rolls because of the
pandemic

05:58:52.610 --> 05:58:52.620 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
05:58:55.368 --> 05:58:55.378 align:start position:0%
the bill House Bill 601 as it was
 
05:58:58.430 --> 05:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
amended by education also added an
 
05:59:00.230 --> 05:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
opt-out provision
 
05:59:00.240 --> 05:59:02.030 align:start position:0%
opt-out provision
so

05:59:02.030 --> 05:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:59:02.040 --> 05:59:04.128 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:59:04.128 --> 05:59:04.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:07.310 --> 05:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
this would the way looking at six House
 
05:59:11.030 --> 05:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 601 as amended it looks like it
 
05:59:12.948 --> 05:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
would allow a family at the application
 
05:59:15.230 --> 05:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
Level to opt out
 
05:59:17.030 --> 05:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
an application for SNAP an application
 
05:59:20.090 --> 05:59:20.100 align:start position:0%
for TANF an application for Medicaid any
 
05:59:22.670 --> 05:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
direct cert any direct cert uh
 
05:59:25.128 --> 05:59:25.138 align:start position:0%
application all right sorry any director
 
05:59:28.190 --> 05:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
program so that'd be TANF snap and then
 
05:59:30.530 --> 05:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
potentially Medicaid they could opt out
 
05:59:34.128 --> 05:59:34.138 align:start position:0%
at the application Level and so
 
05:59:36.530 --> 05:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
currently that doesn't happen so but the
 
05:59:38.510 --> 05:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
law the house bill 601 if it became law
 
05:59:42.368 --> 05:59:42.378 align:start position:0%
DHHS would have to implement that and
 
05:59:45.170 --> 05:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
based on the way I read 601 is they
 
05:59:46.510 --> 05:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
would have to implement it immediately
 
05:59:49.010 --> 05:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
so there would be an opt-out provision
 
05:59:49.020 --> 05:59:49.850 align:start position:0%
so there would be an opt-out provision
in

05:59:49.850 --> 05:59:49.860 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:59:54.230 --> 05:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh starting in fiscal year 24 or fiscal
 
05:59:56.510 --> 05:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
year 24 meaning when the budget passes
 
05:59:59.090 --> 05:59:59.100 align:start position:0%
if you were to add this as amended that
 
06:00:01.730 --> 06:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
would impact 25 adequacy and what I
 
06:00:03.890 --> 06:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
don't know about the opt out is and just
 
06:00:06.110 --> 06:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
just alerting you is some people I
 
06:00:08.270 --> 06:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
imagine would opt out and if they do opt
 
06:00:10.368 --> 06:00:10.378 align:start position:0%
out that might hurt the f r numbers and
 
06:00:11.868 --> 06:00:11.878 align:start position:0%
if it hurts the fnr numbers it would
 
06:00:13.610 --> 06:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
hurt school funding
 
06:00:16.310 --> 06:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
um uh decrease school funding I have no
 
06:00:18.048 --> 06:00:18.058 align:start position:0%
clue who would opt out
 
06:00:19.788 --> 06:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
it might be zero people if it's zero
 
06:00:20.868 --> 06:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
people then every number is your look
 
06:00:22.250 --> 06:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
all the numbers you're looking at would
 
06:00:22.260 --> 06:00:23.090 align:start position:0%
all the numbers you're looking at would
be

06:00:23.090 --> 06:00:23.100 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:00:25.310 --> 06:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
would be fine I guess if someone does
 
06:00:27.590 --> 06:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
opt out the fnr numbers would decrease
 
06:00:30.048 --> 06:00:30.058 align:start position:0%
potentially by an unknown amount I have
 
06:00:31.128 --> 06:00:31.138 align:start position:0%
no clue
 
06:00:33.948 --> 06:00:33.958 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:00:33.958 --> 06:00:35.390 align:start position:0%
um so
I

06:00:35.390 --> 06:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:00:37.070 --> 06:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
the chair is it okay
 
06:00:39.350 --> 06:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
I do not believe and I remember what we
 
06:00:42.708 --> 06:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
what we were trying to do today was just
 
06:00:44.990 --> 06:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
give the doe and Health and Human
 
06:00:48.470 --> 06:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
Services the authority to proceed to
 
06:00:48.480 --> 06:00:50.030 align:start position:0%
Services the authority to proceed to
apply

06:00:50.030 --> 06:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
apply
 
06:00:53.690 --> 06:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
um we did not include this amendment
 
06:00:55.490 --> 06:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
in that bill
 
06:00:58.670 --> 06:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
so I'll have two amendments drafted yes
 
06:01:01.128 --> 06:01:01.138 align:start position:0%
one that will be only section one yes
 
06:01:03.350 --> 06:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
and one that will have section one as
 
06:01:06.170 --> 06:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
well as the data sharing section so the
 
06:01:08.270 --> 06:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
committee can choose which direction you
 
06:01:10.310 --> 06:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
want to go uh when we have those
 
06:01:11.510 --> 06:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
amendments for a later work session
 
06:01:12.708 --> 06:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
06:01:14.930 --> 06:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
and and as you look at those two options
 
06:01:17.390 --> 06:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
and you decide if you do
 
06:01:17.400 --> 06:01:18.048 align:start position:0%
and you decide if you do
um

06:01:18.048 --> 06:01:18.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:20.510 --> 06:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't know the intent of I wasn't
 
06:01:22.970 --> 06:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
there when the amendment occurred
 
06:01:24.830 --> 06:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
um there might have been an intent to
 
06:01:27.048 --> 06:01:27.058 align:start position:0%
have the data sharing sync up with when
 
06:01:28.850 --> 06:01:28.860 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director would go into effect
 
06:01:28.860 --> 06:01:30.708 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director would go into effect
but

06:01:30.708 --> 06:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:01:32.330 --> 06:01:32.340 align:start position:0%
that's not what the amendment I don't
 
06:01:33.590 --> 06:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
think that's what the amendment does so
 
06:01:35.510 --> 06:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
just something to consider if you want
 
06:01:37.610 --> 06:01:37.620 align:start position:0%
to sync up the opt-out with when
 
06:01:39.470 --> 06:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enrolls or do you want to have
 
06:01:41.390 --> 06:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
the opt-out be a standalone process that
 
06:01:43.310 --> 06:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
DHS would Implement as soon as it
 
06:01:45.650 --> 06:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
becomes effective so um something for
 
06:01:46.788 --> 06:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
you to think about I don't know if it
 
06:01:48.530 --> 06:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
was I don't know if that exactly was
 
06:01:50.390 --> 06:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
discussed with how sad so I'm just
 
06:01:52.310 --> 06:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
alerting you if that's something
 
06:01:55.010 --> 06:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
something you might need to consider
 
06:01:57.470 --> 06:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh those that doesn't exist in the
 
06:01:59.628 --> 06:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
current programs correct they don't they
 
06:02:01.670 --> 06:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
don't have any opt-out um DHS has given
 
06:02:02.750 --> 06:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that they don't have any
 
06:02:02.760 --> 06:02:03.770 align:start position:0%
testimony that they don't have any
opt-out

06:02:03.770 --> 06:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
opt-out
 
06:02:03.780 --> 06:02:04.310 align:start position:0%
opt-out
um

06:02:04.310 --> 06:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:08.390 --> 06:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
program that they're doing so uh uh I
 
06:02:11.810 --> 06:02:11.820 align:start position:0%
think if 601 as amended is not passed I
 
06:02:13.128 --> 06:02:13.138 align:start position:0%
I don't know what they would do I think
 
06:02:14.628 --> 06:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
they would continue their program as
 
06:02:18.048 --> 06:02:18.058 align:start position:0%
implemented meaning no opt-out so if you
 
06:02:20.330 --> 06:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
go to yeah just have a conversation with
 
06:02:22.128 --> 06:02:22.138 align:start position:0%
you they were here earlier but they had
 
06:02:24.470 --> 06:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
to leave DHHS people
 
06:02:26.810 --> 06:02:26.820 align:start position:0%
um but that's yeah that's what I think
 
06:02:31.310 --> 06:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:31.320 --> 06:02:33.910 align:start position:0%
 
yep

06:02:33.910 --> 06:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
yep
 
06:02:36.410 --> 06:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
hi Kelly Rambo
 
06:02:39.288 --> 06:02:39.298 align:start position:0%
um Bureau administrator for nutrition
 
06:02:40.490 --> 06:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
and wellness at the Department of
 
06:02:42.530 --> 06:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
Education I just wanted to speak to that
 
06:02:45.708 --> 06:02:45.718 align:start position:0%
at the local level so there is the
 
06:02:47.810 --> 06:02:47.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity for parents
 
06:02:50.030 --> 06:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
um for the freedom reduced program if
 
06:02:52.368 --> 06:02:52.378 align:start position:0%
they do are identified that they are
 
06:02:54.650 --> 06:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
eligible they can opt out of that at the
 
06:02:56.570 --> 06:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
local level currently already
 
06:02:56.580 --> 06:02:58.910 align:start position:0%
local level currently already
okay

06:02:58.910 --> 06:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:02:58.920 --> 06:03:00.490 align:start position:0%
okay
together

06:03:00.490 --> 06:03:00.500 align:start position:0%
together
 
06:03:02.330 --> 06:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
so now
 
06:03:05.448 --> 06:03:05.458 align:start position:0%
um to discuss a potential uh budget
 
06:03:08.270 --> 06:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
amendments that would need to be made or
 
06:03:10.128 --> 06:03:10.138 align:start position:0%
that the department has relative to
 
06:03:11.810 --> 06:03:11.820 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct cert so you have a
 
06:03:13.128 --> 06:03:13.138 align:start position:0%
little table here
 
06:03:16.490 --> 06:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:19.548 --> 06:03:19.558 align:start position:0%
so adequacy no impact on fiscal year 25
 
06:03:22.990 --> 06:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:24.890 --> 06:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
unless you want to make assumptions
 
06:03:27.590 --> 06:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
about opt out and fnr numbers which I
 
06:03:28.750 --> 06:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
can't make
 
06:03:32.750 --> 06:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
the state meals program so we do have uh
 
06:03:35.270 --> 06:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
General funds that go towards State
 
06:03:37.788 --> 06:03:37.798 align:start position:0%
meals uh
 
06:03:39.948 --> 06:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
and so we estimate that to be if
 
06:03:42.410 --> 06:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director were to be enacted a
 
06:03:43.670 --> 06:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
hundred and eighteen thousand dollars in
 
06:03:45.410 --> 06:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
general funds so there's a particular
 
06:03:48.170 --> 06:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
line item uh Kelly can work with with
 
06:03:49.490 --> 06:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
Mickey as far as getting you the
 
06:03:50.690 --> 06:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
information you need if you do to
 
06:03:52.430 --> 06:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct cert we think there will
 
06:03:55.850 --> 06:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
be an increase in timeout timeout yep
 
06:03:58.310 --> 06:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh we were we weren't getting this far
 
06:04:01.250 --> 06:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
down the path were we you had too much
 
06:04:04.910 --> 06:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:06.890 --> 06:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
I think you're way ahead of where we are
 
06:04:10.128 --> 06:04:10.138 align:start position:0%
okay where we are was to
 
06:04:10.138 --> 06:04:12.830 align:start position:0%
okay where we are was to
authorize

06:04:12.830 --> 06:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
authorize
 
06:04:17.150 --> 06:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
application for a prototype
 
06:04:19.548 --> 06:04:19.558 align:start position:0%
of the program okay you're you're
 
06:04:22.070 --> 06:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
solving the problem here or giving us
 
06:04:25.070 --> 06:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
information that we're not even ready to
 
06:04:27.048 --> 06:04:27.058 align:start position:0%
you're building a bridge for us we're
 
06:04:28.490 --> 06:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
not ready to cross
 
06:04:30.410 --> 06:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to lighten your load a
 
06:04:32.628 --> 06:04:32.638 align:start position:0%
little bit and that's and that's fine
 
06:04:34.610 --> 06:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
um uh we're just trying to give you
 
06:04:36.048 --> 06:04:36.058 align:start position:0%
information and be proactive and I
 
06:04:38.930 --> 06:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
understand uh I understand uh you have a
 
06:04:40.190 --> 06:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
lot of information coming your way and
 
06:04:41.930 --> 06:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
you're trying to build the puzzle pieces
 
06:04:45.470 --> 06:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
that is your budget uh if you were to
 
06:04:49.010 --> 06:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
give us the authorization we would
 
06:04:51.350 --> 06:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
attempt to apply immediately if we
 
06:04:53.708 --> 06:04:53.718 align:start position:0%
attempted to apply immediately
 
06:04:57.288 --> 06:04:57.298 align:start position:0%
ah and we were accepted which we believe
 
06:04:59.330 --> 06:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
we would be accepted
 
06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
um there's cost associated with that so
 
06:05:03.890 --> 06:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
by giving us the authority to apply we
 
06:05:06.830 --> 06:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
see it as a mandate to apply to the
 
06:05:09.890 --> 06:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
program meaning we would
 
06:05:11.930 --> 06:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
meaning we would act immediately to
 
06:05:17.628 --> 06:05:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:19.128 --> 06:05:19.138 align:start position:0%
pilot avail
 
06:05:22.070 --> 06:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
may not be for a couple of years
 
06:05:24.830 --> 06:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
um agriculture has to make that
 
06:05:27.770 --> 06:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
available and as of yet I do not believe
 
06:05:30.948 --> 06:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
they have am I you'd know better than I
 
06:05:34.850 --> 06:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
that is correct uh for some reason they
 
06:05:37.430 --> 06:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
have discontinued the pilot right with
 
06:05:40.190 --> 06:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
39 states in the program so we don't
 
06:05:42.110 --> 06:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
think that they'll hold that we're
 
06:05:43.490 --> 06:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
making a lot of assumptions here and a
 
06:05:46.850 --> 06:05:46.860 align:start position:0%
lot of guesses we don't think they'll
 
06:05:49.010 --> 06:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
we think they'll we we speculate that
 
06:05:50.868 --> 06:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
they'll remove that hold on the program
 
06:05:52.368 --> 06:05:52.378 align:start position:0%
because I don't know why they would run
 
06:05:54.110 --> 06:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
a pilot program for 10 years and then
 
06:05:56.390 --> 06:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
suddenly discontinue it we speculate
 
06:05:57.350 --> 06:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
that they'll
 
06:05:59.750 --> 06:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh remove the discontinuing of that
 
06:06:01.490 --> 06:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
program and if they remove that
 
06:06:03.170 --> 06:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
discontinuing of the program and this
 
06:06:05.628 --> 06:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
601 is introduced in the budget we would
 
06:06:08.150 --> 06:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
begin our work to apply to the program
 
06:06:10.430 --> 06:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
um immediately within our deadline the
 
06:06:12.590 --> 06:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
deadline is if they enact if they bring
 
06:06:14.390 --> 06:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
the program back which we speculate that
 
06:06:16.788 --> 06:06:16.798 align:start position:0%
they will again a lot of assumptions and
 
06:06:19.250 --> 06:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
contingencies here we would move forward
 
06:06:19.260 --> 06:06:20.690 align:start position:0%
contingencies here we would move forward
with

06:06:20.690 --> 06:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:06:22.850 --> 06:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
applying for the program and then we
 
06:06:24.410 --> 06:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
would be moved forward with implementing
 
06:06:26.030 --> 06:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
the program if we were accepted into it
 
06:06:27.890 --> 06:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
and just all of those mechanics have
 
06:06:29.810 --> 06:06:29.820 align:start position:0%
costs whether you want to address those
 
06:06:32.448 --> 06:06:32.458 align:start position:0%
costs in the budget we think it makes
 
06:06:33.590 --> 06:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
sense to address in the budget you could
 
06:06:34.610 --> 06:06:34.620 align:start position:0%
you could come up with a different
 
06:06:37.190 --> 06:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle to address them uh but they will
 
06:06:39.948 --> 06:06:39.958 align:start position:0%
have impacts Financial impacts if all
 
06:06:42.530 --> 06:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
those pieces fall into place would it
 
06:06:45.430 --> 06:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
help you if we
 
06:06:49.250 --> 06:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
inserted in uh what we want to the
 
06:06:50.990 --> 06:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
authorization that we want to give you
 
06:06:53.990 --> 06:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we could say we would not expect
 
06:06:57.730 --> 06:06:57.740 align:start position:0%
the department to apply until
 
06:07:01.730 --> 06:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
2025 if in fact it became available
 
06:07:05.990 --> 06:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
so that we're giving you time I just I
 
06:07:09.230 --> 06:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
believe that ultimately the U.S
 
06:07:10.788 --> 06:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
department of Agriculture will
 
06:07:12.770 --> 06:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
eventually kind of say this is going to
 
06:07:15.470 --> 06:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
be for everybody I'm assuming
 
06:07:18.470 --> 06:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
um if you want to go into it but we
 
06:07:19.788 --> 06:07:19.798 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
06:07:22.670 --> 06:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
um and it could come back again they're
 
06:07:26.448 --> 06:07:26.458 align:start position:0%
just I hate to have us lock up money
 
06:07:28.250 --> 06:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
that we don't know about
 
06:07:29.990 --> 06:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is even going to be
 
06:07:32.930 --> 06:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
possible so we simply want to give you
 
06:07:34.548 --> 06:07:34.558 align:start position:0%
authorization but we don't want you to
 
06:07:36.590 --> 06:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
knock yourself out doing all this other
 
06:07:38.330 --> 06:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
stuff when you don't need to Yeah we
 
06:07:39.650 --> 06:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
actually already have
 
06:07:41.570 --> 06:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
kind of have authorization there's no
 
06:07:43.610 --> 06:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
statute or state law preventing us from
 
06:07:44.810 --> 06:07:44.820 align:start position:0%
applying to the program so we actually
 
06:07:47.690 --> 06:07:47.700 align:start position:0%
already have authorization what 601 is
 
06:07:49.970 --> 06:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
is a policy decision by the legislature
 
06:07:51.288 --> 06:07:51.298 align:start position:0%
so if you want to make the policy
 
06:07:53.510 --> 06:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
decision that we don't want you to enter
 
06:07:55.610 --> 06:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
right away we would like you to enter at
 
06:07:57.530 --> 06:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
a specific point in time
 
06:07:59.448 --> 06:07:59.458 align:start position:0%
601 is
 
06:08:01.548 --> 06:08:01.558 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in state like I said
 
06:08:02.930 --> 06:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
nothing in state law preventing us from
 
06:08:04.368 --> 06:08:04.378 align:start position:0%
applying to this program
 
06:08:07.010 --> 06:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
now we just know it has Financial
 
06:08:09.230 --> 06:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
impacts so we've decided to make it
 
06:08:10.730 --> 06:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
we're not going to make the call on if
 
06:08:12.110 --> 06:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
we enter the program the legislature is
 
06:08:13.190 --> 06:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
going to make the call on if we enter
 
06:08:15.470 --> 06:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
the program so we read 601 the
 
06:08:17.330 --> 06:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
department interpret 601 is a mandate
 
06:08:19.310 --> 06:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
not an author not only an authorization
 
06:08:22.010 --> 06:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
but not only the green light but a
 
06:08:25.190 --> 06:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:26.628 --> 06:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
but if you want to change that mandate
 
06:08:28.310 --> 06:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
and change the language and communicate
 
06:08:29.750 --> 06:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
with us in different ways through state
 
06:08:33.230 --> 06:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
law that's that's possible what we're
 
06:08:35.330 --> 06:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
looking at I'm just looking at your
 
06:08:40.430 --> 06:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
columns are 30 30 to 54 million dollars
 
06:08:42.770 --> 06:08:42.780 align:start position:0%
to Mary's Point that's a lot of that's
 
06:08:44.628 --> 06:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
tying up a lot of
 
06:08:47.990 --> 06:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
budget for
 
06:08:50.690 --> 06:08:50.700 align:start position:0%
go ahead so yeah so that is correct but
 
06:08:52.910 --> 06:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's fiscal year 26 so it's kind of um
 
06:08:54.890 --> 06:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
the next committee is also it's 11
 
06:08:57.708 --> 06:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
million so so no no that's that's
 
06:08:59.030 --> 06:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
Federal money
 
06:09:00.350 --> 06:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
um and that's
 
06:09:01.970 --> 06:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
I made a lot of assumptions to get to
 
06:09:04.368 --> 06:09:04.378 align:start position:0%
that number uh Mickey has in my fiscal
 
06:09:05.868 --> 06:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
note now and he'll publish it with a lot
 
06:09:07.788 --> 06:09:07.798 align:start position:0%
of assumptions that's potentially
 
06:09:10.190 --> 06:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
increase in federal money
 
06:09:12.650 --> 06:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
um choose it's gonna likely supplant
 
06:09:14.868 --> 06:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
local school lunch Revenue Local School
 
06:09:17.030 --> 06:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
breakfast Revenue the only cost to the
 
06:09:20.650 --> 06:09:20.660 align:start position:0%
state general fund is approximately
 
06:09:24.470 --> 06:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
118k in the state meals program and then
 
06:09:27.170 --> 06:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
also the department would be to to make
 
06:09:29.390 --> 06:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
these changes to enact these changes we
 
06:09:31.250 --> 06:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
have some Contracting expenses we would
 
06:09:34.310 --> 06:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
like added to our budget to amend some
 
06:09:36.170 --> 06:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
of our software systems and then also
 
06:09:38.690 --> 06:09:38.700 align:start position:0%
Kelly to implement this program Kelly
 
06:09:42.010 --> 06:09:42.020 align:start position:0%
has a staffing position she would uh
 
06:09:44.868 --> 06:09:44.878 align:start position:0%
request and so that's all detailed here
 
06:09:47.090 --> 06:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
so we're just making you aware of if you
 
06:09:49.670 --> 06:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
go forward with this there are Financial
 
06:09:52.190 --> 06:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
costs as far as implementing it
 
06:09:54.410 --> 06:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
um and also the way we would with the
 
06:09:55.910 --> 06:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
way we understand 601 is that we would
 
06:09:57.890 --> 06:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
go forward with it and you have those
 
06:09:57.900 --> 06:09:59.930 align:start position:0%
go forward with it and you have those
costs

06:09:59.930 --> 06:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
costs
 
06:09:59.940 --> 06:10:02.810 align:start position:0%
costs
okay

06:10:02.810 --> 06:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:05.030 --> 06:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
all right and that's that's all I wanted
 
06:10:06.530 --> 06:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
to get across if you have any questions
 
06:10:09.350 --> 06:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
for for Kelly or myself about about
 
06:10:11.448 --> 06:10:11.458 align:start position:0%
these costs and about any technical
 
06:10:12.530 --> 06:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
questions I've given you a lot of
 
06:10:14.150 --> 06:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
information and I know you've had a long
 
06:10:15.708 --> 06:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
day so I appreciate you taking the time
 
06:10:17.750 --> 06:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
to tear us out
 
06:10:19.850 --> 06:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your
 
06:10:19.860 --> 06:10:22.368 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your
efforts

06:10:22.368 --> 06:10:22.378 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
06:10:22.378 --> 06:10:24.048 align:start position:0%
efforts
so

06:10:24.048 --> 06:10:24.058 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:10:27.890 --> 06:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
if we have your numbers and so if we go
 
06:10:29.090 --> 06:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
forward with it it looks like we're
 
06:10:30.470 --> 06:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
talking a couple hundred thousand
 
06:10:30.480 --> 06:10:31.250 align:start position:0%
talking a couple hundred thousand
dollars

06:10:31.250 --> 06:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
06:10:32.868 --> 06:10:32.878 align:start position:0%
that's correct to me it's not the
 
06:10:35.810 --> 06:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
millions that I glanced down here no uh
 
06:10:37.368 --> 06:10:37.378 align:start position:0%
yeah that's sorry because I have to
 
06:10:39.048 --> 06:10:39.058 align:start position:0%
follow the fiscal no process and all
 
06:10:40.730 --> 06:10:40.740 align:start position:0%
revenues on the table I know you mostly
 
06:10:43.730 --> 06:10:43.740 align:start position:0%
care about the general funds
 
06:10:47.930 --> 06:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
can I just add when Karen and I began
 
06:10:49.788 --> 06:10:49.798 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
06:10:52.670 --> 06:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
we we had a committee that came together
 
06:10:54.770 --> 06:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
to talk about
 
06:10:57.830 --> 06:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
um adequacy funding and then we came up
 
06:11:00.288 --> 06:11:00.298 align:start position:0%
with the fact that we didn't have
 
06:11:03.230 --> 06:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
very good numbers on freedom reduce they
 
06:11:05.030 --> 06:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
were inadequate
 
06:11:06.770 --> 06:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
um so we wanted to come up with an
 
06:11:10.310 --> 06:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
adequate measure of a true number of
 
06:11:12.048 --> 06:11:12.058 align:start position:0%
children in the state of New Hampshire
 
06:11:14.990 --> 06:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
that were free and reduced and out of
 
06:11:17.570 --> 06:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
that whole conversation came direct
 
06:11:19.670 --> 06:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid certification that's where all
 
06:11:22.730 --> 06:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
this came from and that's our purpose in
 
06:11:25.548 --> 06:11:25.558 align:start position:0%
seeking was this was to get better
 
06:11:28.430 --> 06:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
numbers for you to work with ultimately
 
06:11:28.440 --> 06:11:29.628 align:start position:0%
numbers for you to work with ultimately
and

06:11:29.628 --> 06:11:29.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:11:32.510 --> 06:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
feed more kids really
 
06:11:32.520 --> 06:11:34.610 align:start position:0%
feed more kids really
um so

06:11:34.610 --> 06:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:11:37.548 --> 06:11:37.558 align:start position:0%
we want to go for well speaking for me
 
06:11:41.390 --> 06:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
we want to go forward with this
 
06:11:44.448 --> 06:11:44.458 align:start position:0%
but would it help if we inserted a date
 
06:11:46.548 --> 06:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
further out for you so you don't like
 
06:11:48.288 --> 06:11:48.298 align:start position:0%
this summer you won't have to do this
 
06:11:50.330 --> 06:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
all summer I just don't want you to get
 
06:11:52.310 --> 06:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
stuck having to do a lot of work when in
 
06:11:54.470 --> 06:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
fact we won't even be eligible until uh
 
06:11:57.470 --> 06:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
26. we we wouldn't begin the work we
 
06:11:58.850 --> 06:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
wouldn't for we're not going to start
 
06:12:00.230 --> 06:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
the work now
 
06:12:02.270 --> 06:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
all right Kelly has to do the most
 
06:12:03.530 --> 06:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
substantial work so I'll let her speak
 
06:12:05.030 --> 06:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
to it
 
06:12:05.040 --> 06:12:06.530 align:start position:0%
to it
foreign

06:12:06.530 --> 06:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
06:12:09.048 --> 06:12:09.058 align:start position:0%
thank you um and like you stated before
 
06:12:12.170 --> 06:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
that currently there is no opportunity
 
06:12:13.610 --> 06:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
at this moment right now there's no
 
06:12:14.750 --> 06:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
pilot program
 
06:12:17.090 --> 06:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
um it's not in place at this moment
 
06:12:18.590 --> 06:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
um there have been talks at the USDA
 
06:12:20.990 --> 06:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
level that there will be another pilot
 
06:12:22.850 --> 06:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
um they're looking at September possibly
 
06:12:24.708 --> 06:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
to have that open
 
06:12:27.110 --> 06:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
um and it was due the the pilot was
 
06:12:29.208 --> 06:12:29.218 align:start position:0%
closed um excuse me due to the RFP that
 
06:12:30.590 --> 06:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
was put out it was put out for a number
 
06:12:32.930 --> 06:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
of years and obviously those close
 
06:12:34.490 --> 06:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
um so we wouldn't be able to actually do
 
06:12:37.788 --> 06:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
any work on it until the new RFP came
 
06:12:40.610 --> 06:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
out so we would then have to do that go
 
06:12:42.548 --> 06:12:42.558 align:start position:0%
through the application process
 
06:12:45.288 --> 06:12:45.298 align:start position:0%
and that I believe was about a year
 
06:12:45.298 --> 06:12:46.850 align:start position:0%
and that I believe was about a year
timeline

06:12:46.850 --> 06:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
06:12:49.128 --> 06:12:49.138 align:start position:0%
um before that whole thing could be done
 
06:12:51.048 --> 06:12:51.058 align:start position:0%
and submitted and approved if if
 
06:12:53.030 --> 06:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
approved by USDA and then the
 
06:12:55.430 --> 06:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
implementation would would take
 
06:12:59.448 --> 06:12:59.458 align:start position:0%
um after that so we would need to um we
 
06:13:01.010 --> 06:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
would need a good amount of time to do
 
06:13:03.410 --> 06:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
the application process which is why I
 
06:13:06.170 --> 06:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
had requested the additional funds for a
 
06:13:07.970 --> 06:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
position our consultant to be able to do
 
06:13:07.980 --> 06:13:09.650 align:start position:0%
position our consultant to be able to do
that

06:13:09.650 --> 06:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:13:09.660 --> 06:13:11.208 align:start position:0%
that
so

06:13:11.208 --> 06:13:11.218 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:13:13.250 --> 06:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
with the authorization
 
06:13:15.288 --> 06:13:15.298 align:start position:0%
that we are providing for you you would
 
06:13:17.150 --> 06:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
like the funds requested
 
06:13:18.590 --> 06:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's correct and then everything would
 
06:13:22.548 --> 06:13:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:23.990 --> 06:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
06:13:26.750 --> 06:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
um so so it's contingent upon we're just
 
06:13:28.250 --> 06:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
assuming the USDA is going to open it
 
06:13:29.390 --> 06:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
back up
 
06:13:31.368 --> 06:13:31.378 align:start position:0%
um if if they don't open it back up and
 
06:13:32.208 --> 06:13:32.218 align:start position:0%
we don't have to do any of the work
 
06:13:33.110 --> 06:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
we're not going to spend the money
 
06:13:33.120 --> 06:13:34.250 align:start position:0%
we're not going to spend the money
especially

06:13:34.250 --> 06:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
especially
 
06:13:36.770 --> 06:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
some of it's set up in state law
 
06:13:38.930 --> 06:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
um but yes we would like the funds to to
 
06:13:40.970 --> 06:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
implement the program assuming well our
 
06:13:42.530 --> 06:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
predictions will all play out the way we
 
06:13:44.448 --> 06:13:44.458 align:start position:0%
think they'll play out
 
06:13:46.010 --> 06:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:13:47.510 --> 06:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
06:13:49.430 --> 06:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you just a quick question you said
 
06:13:51.230 --> 06:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
that you see this bill as a mandate to
 
06:13:52.548 --> 06:13:52.558 align:start position:0%
go ahead and apply for direct
 
06:13:55.490 --> 06:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
certification when looking at the you
 
06:13:57.890 --> 06:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
know uh B language and that's what I'm
 
06:14:00.230 --> 06:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
trying to understand it says Department
 
06:14:02.990 --> 06:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
of Education participation in the
 
06:14:04.788 --> 06:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
demonstration projects to evaluate
 
06:14:07.190 --> 06:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
direct certification it doesn't seem to
 
06:14:07.200 --> 06:14:08.270 align:start position:0%
direct certification it doesn't seem to
be

06:14:08.270 --> 06:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:14:10.490 --> 06:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
guiding you to
 
06:14:12.708 --> 06:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
you know entering direct certification
 
06:14:14.990 --> 06:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
just in the specific pilot program I'm
 
06:14:17.628 --> 06:14:17.638 align:start position:0%
trying to understand where the uh you
 
06:14:20.270 --> 06:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
know legal mandate is because my reading
 
06:14:20.280 --> 06:14:21.708 align:start position:0%
know legal mandate is because my reading
doesn't

06:14:21.708 --> 06:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
06:14:24.350 --> 06:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
agree with that but I could be missing
 
06:14:25.910 --> 06:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
something wouldn't be the first one or
 
06:14:27.890 --> 06:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
the last time no I I think you're you're
 
06:14:29.150 --> 06:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
looking into the details of the language
 
06:14:31.548 --> 06:14:31.558 align:start position:0%
and I think I think your reading is I
 
06:14:33.110 --> 06:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
think your reading is fine
 
06:14:35.090 --> 06:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
um uh I I think your interpretation is
 
06:14:35.100 --> 06:14:36.110 align:start position:0%
um uh I I think your interpretation is
fine

06:14:36.110 --> 06:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
fine
 
06:14:37.788 --> 06:14:37.798 align:start position:0%
um the way we interpret this is this has
 
06:14:39.350 --> 06:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
been an ongoing conversation we've had
 
06:14:41.330 --> 06:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
with uh the former chairwoman umberger
 
06:14:42.350 --> 06:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
about this
 
06:14:42.360 --> 06:14:43.368 align:start position:0%
about this
um exact

06:14:43.368 --> 06:14:43.378 align:start position:0%
um exact
 
06:14:47.270 --> 06:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh this language exactly this
 
06:14:49.128 --> 06:14:49.138 align:start position:0%
position we're in the department has
 
06:14:51.110 --> 06:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
full authority to enter this program
 
06:14:53.690 --> 06:14:53.700 align:start position:0%
unilaterally without legislative without
 
06:14:55.610 --> 06:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight or sorry without
 
06:14:58.850 --> 06:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
legislative enactment so
 
06:15:00.288 --> 06:15:00.298 align:start position:0%
this is really
 
06:15:02.990 --> 06:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
what the activity you're doing we see
 
06:15:04.730 --> 06:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
this as legislative intent whether it
 
06:15:06.288 --> 06:15:06.298 align:start position:0%
really is legislative intent or not or
 
06:15:08.150 --> 06:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
whether the language truly does say you
 
06:15:10.548 --> 06:15:10.558 align:start position:0%
it says Xiao which is a strong word but
 
06:15:12.410 --> 06:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
it says shall participate and so just
 
06:15:14.150 --> 06:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
the way we interpret that we can
 
06:15:15.590 --> 06:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
disagree about interpretation but the
 
06:15:17.150 --> 06:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
way the department interprets that is I
 
06:15:19.190 --> 06:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate your point for the record I'm
 
06:15:20.810 --> 06:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
one of the people who didn't exactly
 
06:15:22.490 --> 06:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
vote for this but
 
06:15:26.150 --> 06:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
even if it does become law my reading
 
06:15:27.590 --> 06:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
would be that this is talking about
 
06:15:30.470 --> 06:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
direct about the you know pilot and not
 
06:15:33.890 --> 06:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
about you know the direct participation
 
06:15:36.048 --> 06:15:36.058 align:start position:0%
in the Pro the particip participation in
 
06:15:37.910 --> 06:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
the direct enrollment
 
06:15:39.770 --> 06:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
but I do hear you when you say that you
 
06:15:41.390 --> 06:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
already have that Authority without
 
06:15:44.628 --> 06:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
legislation I appreciate that
 
06:15:47.090 --> 06:15:47.100 align:start position:0%
can I just add
 
06:15:49.190 --> 06:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
that you do
 
06:15:50.750 --> 06:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
but the commissioner
 
06:15:55.010 --> 06:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
has insisted that he has a legislative
 
06:15:57.048 --> 06:15:57.058 align:start position:0%
reason to do it
 
06:16:01.910 --> 06:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise he didn't want to move forward
 
06:16:04.548 --> 06:16:04.558 align:start position:0%
and that came from
 
06:16:06.948 --> 06:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
representative umberger and our
 
06:16:08.330 --> 06:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
committee when we were working together
 
06:16:13.070 --> 06:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
this is why we went forward with 601
 
06:16:13.080 --> 06:16:16.310 align:start position:0%
this is why we went forward with 601
okay

06:16:16.310 --> 06:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:18.830 --> 06:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
I think we're all set I know we're worn
 
06:16:26.650 --> 06:16:26.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:29.750 --> 06:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
so we'll adjourn and reconvene tomorrow
 
06:16:35.510 --> 06:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:35.520 --> 06:16:47.590 align:start position:0%
 
caucus

06:16:47.590 --> 06:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:50.868 --> 06:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
so just just for the committee's uh
 
06:16:53.930 --> 06:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
knowledge here we did recess fourth
 
06:16:57.110 --> 06:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 430 and and Hospital 626 the
 
06:16:59.230 --> 06:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
2f EFA bills which means technically
 
06:17:01.730 --> 06:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
they're open but I don't know if you
 
06:17:03.890 --> 06:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
wanted to have me schedule something
 
06:17:05.930 --> 06:17:05.940 align:start position:0%
again another work session in this the
 
06:17:07.910 --> 06:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
calendar or just if you wanted to make a
 
06:17:09.288 --> 06:17:09.298 align:start position:0%
plan of when you wanted to do those
 
06:17:09.298 --> 06:17:11.570 align:start position:0%
plan of when you wanted to do those
bills

06:17:11.570 --> 06:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
bills
 
06:17:16.310 --> 06:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:18.590 --> 06:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
wait until the regular members come as
 
06:17:23.110 --> 06:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:25.788 --> 06:17:25.798 align:start position:0%
party I could I could I could just
 
06:17:28.128 --> 06:17:28.138 align:start position:0%
schedule a work session Friday at one on
 
06:17:30.830 --> 06:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
those okay if that works and then just
 
06:17:32.628 --> 06:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
do them Friday at one or ten I mean
 
06:17:35.030 --> 06:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
whatever why don't we do them a ten ten
 
06:17:46.490 --> 06:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:49.670 --> 06:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's fine I'll be here well we can do
 
06:17:50.750 --> 06:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
it at one
 
06:17:53.090 --> 06:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
I I had scheduled a budget work session
 
06:17:55.670 --> 06:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
for 10 but I think as Janet hasn't done
 
06:17:57.890 --> 06:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
it yet so I can probably do the bills at
 
06:17:59.448 --> 06:17:59.458 align:start position:0%
10 and then 10 30 for a budget work
 
06:18:01.368 --> 06:18:01.378 align:start position:0%
session then we can do work after if we
 
06:18:02.510 --> 06:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
want to
 
06:18:02.520 --> 06:18:04.448 align:start position:0%
want to
yeah

06:18:04.448 --> 06:18:04.458 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:18:13.730 --> 06:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:15.830 --> 06:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
you're not losing so far
 
06:18:15.840 --> 06:18:18.048 align:start position:0%
you're not losing so far
