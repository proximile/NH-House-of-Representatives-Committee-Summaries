00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
the various builds which apply
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
and actually see maps that have been
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
submitted some of which have been
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
submitted by some of the people you
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
might have been talking to outside of
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
the auditorium here tonight
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
um so what is redistricting
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
redistricting it's a process that occurs
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
every 10 years after the federal census
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
is completed the population data is used
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
to create districts for representation
 
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
at all levels of government here in new
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire our constitution says the
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the creation of those
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
districts is the legislative legislature
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
which is the in the general court the
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
house in the senate the districts that
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
are being drawn in new hampshire will be
 
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
the congressional
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
state senate and a state representative
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
there is also redistricting for county
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner districts and delegates to
 
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
the state party convention so when you
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
click on that website and look at the
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
submission that the editing sector will
 
00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:56.070 align:start position:0%
submission that the editing sector will
receive

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
receive
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
there were handouts outside tonight for
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
you that information gives you more
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
detail on hillsborough county
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
and uh from the house side and i'm sure
 
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
from the senate side it would be very
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
helpful for you to comment on things
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
that you might think
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
district 37
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
it consists of two towns
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
hudson and pelham
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
total number of voters according to the
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
last census is 40 000 people
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
those 40 000
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
choose on a single ballot
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
of 11 state representatives right now in
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
the two towns
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
from my town in pelham we have two of
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
those representatives who actually live
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
in the town of helen nine
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
live in hudson
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
and that's the way it's been for 20
 
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.590 align:start position:0%
and that's the way it's been for 20
years

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.950 align:start position:0%
years
um

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
the we are not asking for anything
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
drastic you don't need maps for this
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
this district we just need to cleave
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
these two towns that have very different
 
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.830 align:start position:0%
these two towns that have very different
ethics

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
i do want to make a point that this is
 
00:24:34.799 --> 00:24:35.669 align:start position:0%
i do want to make a point that this is
not

00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
unlike some of the maps and
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
jiggling that has to go on this is not a
 
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.789 align:start position:0%
jiggling that has to go on this is not a
constant

00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
constant
 
00:24:42.799 --> 00:24:44.230 align:start position:0%
constant
appeal

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
this both towns are heavily premises not
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
even ready
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
and this is not going to change the
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
the power in the in these state house
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
however we are asking
 
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
like the rest of the state
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
of our state reps living among us
 
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
going to the grocery stores that we see
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
going to churches
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
and getting involved in the community
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that's some reason
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
and we've been waiting a long time for
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
the street district and we have promised
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
last time that we would have our own
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
district and our smoke-filled rooms
 
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.110 align:start position:0%
district and our smoke-filled rooms
somewhere

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
we ended up back together in this
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
the fun doesn't stop there though
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
um is as weird as it is to have 11 state
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
reps on a single battle
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
running for the state house we have a
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
senator a senate district in which our
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
senator represents
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
three rockingham county towns
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
in one hillsville county
 
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.390 align:start position:0%
in one hillsville county
ours

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
ours
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%

unfortunately not really close to pelham
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
and why
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
that district if you look out of the map
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
it could be copied from the old history
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
books i used to teach history from
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
mr jerry
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
gerrymander we would like our senator we
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%

to be in the same county that we are in
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
which is hillsborough county so we're
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
asking for a very simple thing let's put
 
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
us back
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
in our own district

holding this hearing and for allowing
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
those very first girlfriends residents
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities to speak i'm proud to
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
appear before you today to testify in
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
favor of your maps in a transparent and
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
inclusive redescription process
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
as a participant in new hampshire
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
elections both as a voter and more
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
recently a volunteer i believe a free
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
democracy is essential to securing all
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
of the freedoms that we do as americans
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure our government
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
fulfills this great purpose every vote
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
must count and every all voters must be
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
represented here with redistricting
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
underway it's critical that new
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire's new district maps accurately
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
reflect the population and are free from
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering and other biases
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
drawing paramounts will ensure that the
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
people are the ones who keep the outcome
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
of elections not big corporations
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
wealthy donors forces are passed
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
redistricting is one of the most
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
significant parts of the electoral
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
process and new hampshire residents
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
deserve the chance to provide input
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
before the maximum
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with just three days ago
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
before state legislators go improve maps
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
we still don't know when the new map
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
will be made available to the public and
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
whether there will be opportunities for
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
public comment on the maps
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
this lack of transparency is
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
disappointing and only furthers division
 
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
and distress
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
between citizens and our elected leaders
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
i respectfully request the committee
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
numbers commit to releasing the new maps
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
to the public at least two weeks before
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
the final vote
 
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
additionally to ensure that the new maps
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
are drawn fairly enough the public can
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
be involved in the process i ask that
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
the committee scheduled at least four
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
additional appearance for residents to
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
review the maps ask questions and voice
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
their free doctor concerns
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
in addition to allowing public input
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
before the new mac survey official it's
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
important that any additional hearings
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
be made accessible to online residents
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
via remote access
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
while there are undeniable benefits to a
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
meeting in person physical attendance
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
isn't always possible for many
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrators whether it be due to high
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
risk health positions caretaking
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities or work studies
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
for the numerous teleconferencing tools
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
available are at our disposal it's
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
easier now than ever for those who can't
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
attend in person to make their
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
coursework remotely
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
the use of remote participation tools
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
has the added benefit of ensuring future
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
hearings are available to all of you
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
them either in real time or as part of
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
the historical record as we're doing
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
with our reporting today
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
we might not always agree on everything
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire i'm an atheist fan
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
of red sox territory so i definitely
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
know what that's like
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
however one thing i hope technology on
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
is the importance of very equal
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
representation in our government that
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
principle is what sets our democracy
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
apart what guarantees our freedom and
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
why we're all able to be here speaking
 
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.750 align:start position:0%
why we're all able to be here speaking
today

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
in this important moment i call on the
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
committee to uphold their duty to
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
protect our democracy and take action to
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that the maps are done
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%

00:30:20.559 --> 00:30:23.230 align:start position:0%

access on people who are at home with a
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
health condition um we'd like to testify
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
should have that opportunity so i wish
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
that had been
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
thought about
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of the planning but um we'll do
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
our best with that um
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
future hearings would be good to have
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
complete access for everybody who wants
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
to be here
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
i want to let you know that amherst was
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
among 74 times representing 562 866
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
granite staters who voted in favor of
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
the fair religions and processes
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
of the elections
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
without the amherst the warrant article
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
passed by almost a three to one margin i
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
expected we had not been in the worst
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
part of a 100 year pandemic that
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
countless and far higher people are sick
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
and tired of unfair amounts and very
 
00:31:16.399 --> 00:31:18.149 align:start position:0%
and tired of unfair amounts and very
negative

00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
negative
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
you ever wonder why volunteers help them
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
need to stand out in the snow in
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
december and january
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
to collect signatures for a town morning
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
article residential calling for a fair
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
non-partisan and transparent
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
distribution plus finding people be
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
compelled to collect significantly work
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%

00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
that's what i actually did
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
finally they feel that they have no
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
choice the argument new hampshire
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
not just feel good hearings to make the
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
public think you are listening but truly
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
fair and nonpartisan go to the districts

00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
but you work for us and the public is
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
spoken loudly and clearly about what
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
they want and they expect nothing less
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
than variability maps for the state of
 
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
as you begin to wrap up this public
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
learning process you can ensure the will
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
of a large number of dimensional voters
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%

following
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
house the district committee should set
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
a timetable event maps are going to be
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
released at least two weeks before the
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
maps are voted on for the public to
 
00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.830 align:start position:0%
maps are voted on for the public to
review

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
analyze this didn't happen 10 years ago
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
you should commit to this statement with
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
four additional hearings after the
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
national bond so any questions about
 
00:32:50.159 --> 00:32:51.750 align:start position:0%
national bond so any questions about
them

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
for those who will be affected by them
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering cannot be repeated and
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
then unlike tonight and the previous
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
time hearing spanish speakers must be
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
given they participate in experience
 
00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:03.590 align:start position:0%
given they participate in experience
remotely

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
if they want to testify and make their
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
voices heard we have a raging pandemic
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
people are still dying and we need to
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
respect the ability for people to have
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
their voice heard if they have uh access
 
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.549 align:start position:0%
their voice heard if they have uh access
issues

00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
but the people of amherst and many other
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
communities within these non-buying
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
resolutions have clearly said
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
what we urge the new hampshire general
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
court to carry out the redistricting in
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
a fair and transparent way to public
 
00:33:28.559 --> 00:33:29.509 align:start position:0%
a fair and transparent way to public
meetings

00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
not to pay their people
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
military party to include communities of
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
also signed up to to speak is the
 
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
hello my former colleagues and
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%

00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative griffin for
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
acknowledging colin powell's passing i
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%

back into my remarks but he was a great
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
and great american
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
so my name is melanie levake i'm from
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
the act of redistricting districts for
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
redrawing the districts every 10 years
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
is meant to account for fluctuations in
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
our population for the purpose of
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
accurate representation
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
i am here this evening not only to ask
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
you as our legislative body and policy
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
makers to draw
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
but to help my fellow citizens
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
understand that this is not supposed to
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
be a political process
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
a very real side effect of drawing the
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
districts to favor one party over
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
another was in our educational system
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
i live in brookline i served on the
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
policy appliance co-op school court and
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
i grew up in nashville
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
and i served as a senator for district
 
00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.390 align:start position:0%
and i served as a senator for district
12.

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
12.
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
between the three towns of nashua palace
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
and brookline there are over 13 000
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
public school students
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
with almost 11 000 of these students
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
relying on the national public school
 
00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.790 align:start position:0%
relying on the national public school
system

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
allison brookline has some of the top
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
public schools in the state
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
and we do value our public schools
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
there are just over 2 000 public school
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
students in the remainder of the four
 
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.870 align:start position:0%
students in the remainder of the four
pounds

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
pounds
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
within district 12.
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
why is it that district 12
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
the prevailing policies of four towns
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
with 2 000 students in a pocket with a
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
population of 15 000 people
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
override three towns with 13 000
 
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.109 align:start position:0%
override three towns with 13 000
students

00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
and 95 000 people
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
something seems off there
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
when lions are drawn to give one party
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
an unfair advantage over the other
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
we only widen the divide between the
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
parties and have more extreme primaries
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
and more extreme policies
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
the attacks on the bedrock of our
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
democracy are greater now than ever
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
and we need to make sure that voters
 
00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.710 align:start position:0%
and we need to make sure that voters
know

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
we the people of new hampshire ought to
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
be very concerned
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
earlier this year
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
we heard stephen stephanie chairman of
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire republican party who
 
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.589 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire republican party who
said

00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
because we control redistricting i can
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
stand here today and guarantee you that
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
we will send a conservative republican
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
to washington dc
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
as a congressperson in 2022
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's very scary
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
but it's also very telling
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
when one political party dictates what
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
maps look like the people of our state
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
are the ones that lose
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
this committee must clearly demonstrate
 
00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:17.599 align:start position:0%
that not to be drawn for the specific
 
00:37:17.599 --> 00:37:19.430 align:start position:0%
that not to be drawn for the specific
purpose

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
of serving the people and not the
 
00:37:21.359 --> 00:37:23.270 align:start position:0%
of serving the people and not the
politicians

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
politicians
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
but with just 30 days until housing
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
congressional maps will be voted on by
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
this committee the public has no idea
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
when we will be able to review the maps
 
00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
before the vote or if there will be any
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
hearing for feedback before the vote
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
this does not instill trust in our
 
00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:43.750 align:start position:0%
this does not instill trust in our
process

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
it would also serve the public well if
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
committee leadership would recommend to
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
the speaker and senate president that we
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
adopt remote access for public
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%

democracy
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
is not something we have it is something
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
that we do
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
and my fear is that if we don't do it we
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
are sure to lose it
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you

sorry that you know you're here sorry
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
but if you look at the population of

blitzfield it's a little over 8 000
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%

a little over 7 million operating budget
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
for manchester 156 million

brother 102
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
for manchester united
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure how the needs of
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
manchester or richfield
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
are in fact
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
with their representation
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
i just want to have you guys keep that
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
in mind
 
00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.829 align:start position:0%
in mind
that

00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
it's weird for me being in manchester
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
to have included a town that i actually
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
never go to
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure it's very lovely i just
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
don't go south germany to the east west
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
north where i go on the turnpike but
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
down to nashua it's just the reality of
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
being in a high-density location with
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
manchester united we just don't make it
 
00:40:42.319 --> 00:40:43.750 align:start position:0%
manchester united we just don't make it
delicious

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
delicious
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm hearing that because
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's something that seems to be
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
coming up with more than just me
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
so i hope that you guys consider that
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
hey thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
speak today um chairman and
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
representative and some senators i
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
i understand that this undertaking
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
is not a simple task
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh it's very complicated but i'm here
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
today and i probably shouldn't be
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
because there will be no compromise
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
but the only reason i know that i'm
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
going to be hurt is to be here today i
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
can write to you i can send emails to
 
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:35.910 align:start position:0%
can write to you i can send emails to
you

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure that i'm heard
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
but i know right now that i'm heard
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
i would like to encourage you
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
to encourage your colleagues speaker
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
sherman packard
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
and the senate president morse
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
to think about that
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
to think about building a more inclusive
 
00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.670 align:start position:0%
to think about building a more inclusive
environment

00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.710 align:start position:0%
environment
for

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
all kinds of folks
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
those who live very remotely folks who
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
don't have transportation
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
folks who have
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
mobility issues and folks that have
 
00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
approvally concerns i know that's not
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
your decision not to have to
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
but i do feel that you're working in
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
these people you're sharing your
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
expertise with these people and i wish
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
you would share that opinion uh i
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
certainly shared it myself with them
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
over the weekend uh
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
i want to talk about the desire for fair
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
maps now there's a surprise you know
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
i've heard over and over again i've i've
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
paid attention to all of the hearings
 
00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh and i hear the same thing
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
over and over again
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
the call for fair
 
00:42:49.599 --> 00:42:51.190 align:start position:0%
the call for fair
transparent

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.710 align:start position:0%
transparent
processes

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
processes
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
to call for a non-partisan
 
00:42:56.839 --> 00:42:58.470 align:start position:0%
to call for a non-partisan
action

00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%
for you to see this as an opportunity
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
and i'd like you to be innovative
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
i would like to think about doing things
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
maybe not the way they've always been
 
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.230 align:start position:0%
maybe not the way they've always been
done

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
but to think about what you're hearing
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
tonight was some of these sounds are
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
feeling disenfranchised
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
with things that they exist right now
 
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
and you know that maybe there's a better
 
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.430 align:start position:0%
and you know that maybe there's a better
way

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
maybe there's thought getting into some
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
commonality within these communities
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
and that makes more sense when you're
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
putting them together and they're
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
sharing the voting block
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh where shares of a district with
 
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.630 align:start position:0%
uh where shares of a district with
deering

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
deering
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
we do nothing engineering
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
we have no shared water supply we have
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
no shared emergency services no shared
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
school district
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
however here we share the school
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
district with hillsborough
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
but they're not
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
part of a loading block of hillsborough
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
so that doesn't really make a lot of
 
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.230 align:start position:0%
so that doesn't really make a lot of
sense

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
where it's got 9 000 people so we have
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
enough people to have our own
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
space um but we don't
 
00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.270 align:start position:0%
space um but we don't
so

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to find an entertaining
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
idea about that
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
i also um
 
00:44:20.829 --> 00:44:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
ask about the criteria
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
that you're using
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
to draw these maps
 
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
november 18th is the month from today
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
and i understand that that's a critical
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
deadline for you
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
and look at your website and i read
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
what's out there but i don't really hear
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
any clear outline of the criteria
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
that you're using
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
to create your maps i understand that
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't explain to me
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
so i'm feeling like i really don't know
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
and there's the transparency factor
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
because there's a lack there of
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
so please
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
think about
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
the critical task that you're
 
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.510 align:start position:0%
the critical task that you're
undertaking

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
undertaking
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we're going to be
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
living with this now for the next 10
 
00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.270 align:start position:0%
living with this now for the next 10
years

00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
i don't want you to favor one party over
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
another but what i do want you to favor
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
is fairness
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.069 align:start position:0%
 
democracy

00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
is a precious thing
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
all we have to look is around some of
 
00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:43.349 align:start position:0%
all we have to look is around some of
our

00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know countries that don't have one
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
and look at what their lives are like
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
our democracy is a very fragile thing
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
it's been indented and banged around a
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
little bit lately and i would like to
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
think that we can sort of restore
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
a positive flavor to that and one of
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
those elements would be a fair
 
00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:03.990 align:start position:0%
those elements would be a fair
public

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
transparent redistricting process
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
i would also like
 
00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
as i've also heard from many other
 
00:46:11.359 --> 00:46:12.230 align:start position:0%
as i've also heard from many other
people

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to see the maps
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
and then have another chance
 
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
to offer an opinion
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
or a concern
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
or congratulations
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
for what i'm seeing
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
so please consider
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
i know this is
 
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
taking a lot of your time
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
but due to this
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
immense responsibility that you're
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
undertaking here by this process i think
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
it deserves
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
the time
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
to give us another round of comment
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
after these maps are brought
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
so i would appreciate that i appreciate
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
what you do
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your service and i thank
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:07.860 align:start position:0%

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the time you are spending
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
and the work you are putting into these
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
publicly sessions
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
this is the first time that i have
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
followed the process of redistricting
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
so far the current process is more open
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
than the description i've heard of
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
previous years and i've mentioned this
 
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
i have participated in the marathon
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
citizen drawn mapping project by
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
submitting leah from my calendar
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
and doing my telephone survey of 10
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
pounds in hillsborough county to become
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
your shared services
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
i learned how essential it is to
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
consider community communities of
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
interests that incorporate
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
school districts and share services and
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
common issues in addition to population
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
the maps created by this project have
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
been submitted to the committee's
 
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.990 align:start position:0%
been submitted to the committee's
website

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
and are shown side by side with the 2010
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%

00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
i encouraged members of both committees
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
and the public to look at these maps
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
i believe the mapathon maps statistics
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
that provide warfare representation for
 
00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.109 align:start position:0%
that provide warfare representation for
voters

00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
specifically speaking about antrim its
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
close ties with barrington are
 
00:48:41.839 --> 00:48:43.109 align:start position:0%
close ties with barrington are
significant

00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
many residents from both towns are

00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
andrew and ben and vince should also
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
share this place
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
and in new hampshire house andrew is in
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
district 1 with hillsboro and laser
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
while bennington is in district 3 with
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
hancock and greenfield it would make
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
sense to have antrim and bangkok
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
together with other nearby towns in the
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%

wilson and louisville
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
this district should be more compact
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
our military senate district district 8
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
is also spread out and in benefit from
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
greater compactness
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
when these first listening sessions are
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
complete i ask that you continue to have
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
an open process
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
please explain what criteria you will
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
consider in addition to the mathematics
 
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.829 align:start position:0%
consider in addition to the mathematics
of

00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:11.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
when your maps are gone
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
please release them to the cover for
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
review before they are finalized
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
and then i ask that you hold a second
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
round of missing sessions in each county
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
for your
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
feedback from your public
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
lastly have the option of your
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
participation in these sessions so that
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
interested citizens may speak before the
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
committees regardless of their
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
individual circumstances
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the complex and difficult
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
work you are doing and for the
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for speaking
 
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.589 --> 00:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
hello i am joe rogers of district 38 and
 
00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak so i
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
that like when you guys do this work
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
just consider sort of where we are as a
 
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:14.630 align:start position:0%
just consider sort of where we are as a
nation

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
nation
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
like democracy is not doing well like
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know tonight i'm thinking about
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
whether i'm going to come here tonight
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
or not i'm very skeptical whether we
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
actually live in a democracy like i my
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
own personal belief is our democracy is
 
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.030 align:start position:0%
own personal belief is our democracy is
failing

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
failing
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
and it's like there's a myriad of
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
reasons but it's
 
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
if people are losing faith that they're
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
that they're being heard that their
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
voices made heard
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
and gerrymandering did not help like in
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
the district 38 district that i'm from
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
it's a mess like i'm born and raised in
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire before i really got
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
involved like i didn't even i hadn't
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
so this work is super important
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be partisan it should be done
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
based upon
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
principles right it shouldn't be based
 
00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
upon opinions it shouldn't be based upon
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
politics it should be
 
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
the goal should be to support democracy
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
and not tear it down thank you
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%

listening session and thanks for all the
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
which is um most
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
northwest town
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
in the hillsborough county
 
00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.030 align:start position:0%
in the hillsborough county
um

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
another gentleman
 
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned the warren article that they
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
did this year i would love to say that
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
hillsborough the town in hillsborough
 
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
along with maybe a dozen other towns
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
actually did a similar warrant article
 
00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
in march of 2020 this was before cohen
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
so we could get signatures a little
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
easier um and it was also before we had
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
the last election
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
so it was totally a non-partisan vote
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
and overwhelmingly the town of
 
00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.510 align:start position:0%
and overwhelmingly the town of
hillsborough

00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
hillsborough
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
passed this warrant asking for fair
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
redistricting and in the at that time we
 
00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
were asked also requesting a fair
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
registration commission which we know
 
00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.230 align:start position:0%
registration commission which we know
[Music]

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
didn't quite
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
transpire but we were asking for a fair
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
register thing because we all know that
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
this gerrymandering exists and certainly
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
not just in new hampshire not just in my
 
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
own b38 but all over the country i mean
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
i came out of massachusetts where i was
 
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
in a district that was gerrymandered all
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
the way around 128
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
i grew up in a town in ohio that was
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
steering angered from up in the northern
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
town all the way down to the ohio river
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
so that we could bring in some you know
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
different people and i you know we've
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
all seen the steak maps and salamander
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
maps and we know that it's going on
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
so when the time comes through yes yes
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
they're fairly distributed in a
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
non-partisan manner and as such what
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
happened is the town administrator on
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
behalf of the select board was required
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
to send a letter to all our elected
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
representatives which included
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
governor sununu
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
our state senator senator ward and four
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
of our representatives uh we had two of
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
them day one and two from the e38
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
and so this this was a lot of manpower
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
this was a lot of work to do getting the
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
signatures getting this boat in the town
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
um at the town meeting and then the town
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
administrator and the psych board had to
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
send these letters out and i have copies
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
of the letters
 
00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.750 align:start position:0%
of the letters
[Music]

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
i think it's important for you to
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
realize how much manpower a woman power
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
went into doing this just in the little
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
town of hillsboro six thousand people
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
and we had many many more towns do it um
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
in 2021 and it was a lot of manpower it
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
was a lot of work not just the best
 
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
volunteers but also with the town and we
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
were representing the six thousand
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
residents of hillsborough say we went
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
through the district
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
and i feel like our time is a waste like
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
what we did we're trying to be
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
democratic and what democracies tell us
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
to do and i feel like it's gonna be a
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
waste of time and i think it was pleased
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
with you to not make our time a waste
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
when we were trying to get very
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
distracted the last signature i got
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
to get this on the warrants the last
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
signature i got was from the
 
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of cancer she only had a
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
few weeks left and she signed this
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
petition and i'm honored she did that
 
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
but i'm also really really angry that
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's necessary for her to do that and
 
00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
for me to go get his signature and
 
00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:02.799 align:start position:0%
request people to science and all the
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
manpower they took in
 
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
to do this i mean we shouldn't have had
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
to drive down here for we'll start to
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
ask you to do better
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
it should be no greater i'm not a future
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
expert but
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
i know that this day and age of
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
computers you can plug in every prayer
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
that you like and you can get whatever
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
you want out of these maps and i am
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
requesting that you plug in
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
allowed out
 
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
in the senate chamber of the house i
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
will admit sometimes with 400 members
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
instead of 24 it takes a little longer
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
to get it under control but
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.559 --> 00:57:25.670 align:start position:0%

01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
and they will directly impact our
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
communities and our generations of
 
01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.950 align:start position:0%
communities and our generations of
future

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
but we still know very little about how
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
maps are being done
 
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
or we will be able to see them before
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
and even more concerned
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
the u.s census members show numbers i'm
 
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.230 align:start position:0%
the u.s census members show numbers i'm
sorry

01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.349 align:start position:0%
sorry
um

01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
show that the hispanic groups are
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
growing and political
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
and community um
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
so it's gaining power and
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
i think that we need to be represented
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
and it is critical that the districts
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
are grown in a way that respects the
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
political rights
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
and shared interests of that community
 
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
that is represented by each
 
01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.190 align:start position:0%
that is represented by each
district

01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.309 align:start position:0%
district
and

01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
i would like to add
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
as leaders that you are
 
01:01:53.119 --> 01:01:53.910 align:start position:0%
as leaders that you are
and

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
you have the opportunity to do this
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that you set an
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
example for our future generations
 
01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:03.190 align:start position:0%
example for our future generations
and

01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:14.410 --> 01:02:14.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:15.670 align:start position:0%

good evening all thank you so much for

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%

ask for your full attention as i can
 
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
and respect the rest of the brazens for
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
the donation of the public here
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
my name is emily olson and i am a 26
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
year old resident of goffstown
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
like many of my friends and colleagues
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
my age i am weighing the benefits of
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
making my life and growing my family in
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
contrary to the seating and action of
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire senate and house
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
registration committees
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
and the whispering announcements of the
 
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
public hearings on this issue
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
the effects of redistricting will last
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
for 10 years
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
affecting young new hampshire citizens
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
ready to start the next chapters in
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
their lives like me
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
let me be clear when i say i will not
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
raise a family or make a life in a place
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
where my voice is not respected
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
not heard and even crossed aside in the
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
name of political partisanship and the
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
sole focus of our representatives on
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
winning the next election through shady
 
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
and non-democratic practices
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
in order for us to have a functioning
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
democracy the public your constituents
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
need to have a voice throughout the
 
01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.150 align:start position:0%
need to have a voice throughout the
process

01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
therefore i'm asking that this committee
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
committed to holding at least one highly
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
advertised public hearing with public
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
testimony on any maps before they have
 
01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.670 align:start position:0%
testimony on any maps before they have
passed

01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
this meeting must be advertised at least
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
a week in advance and they must have
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
virtual access
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
while streaming these meetings on
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
youtube is a step in the right direction
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
a platform that allows for public
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
testimony to be given virtually
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
such a zoom would be much more
 
01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
preferable as somebody else spoke today
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
they already have compromised i am a
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
member of the proper knights family
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
risking my family's life to be
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
here talking to you but some of you not
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
even able to make eye contact
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
criterium and the process for how the
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
maximum jobs must also be transparent to
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
the public beforehand
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
we the people should not have to ask for
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
our democratic process to be transparent
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
we should also not have to ask for the
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
redistricting process to be in line with
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
both the us and new hampshire
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
constitutions and all federal and state
 
01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.230 align:start position:0%
constitutions and all federal and state
laws

01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
laws
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
we demand that the redistricting respect
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
both the geographical and political
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
integrity of the boundaries
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
u.s servants of the people should not be
 
01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
choosing your voters to generate
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
rather we the voters are
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
constitutionally bound to choose our
 
01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.470 align:start position:0%
constitutionally bound to choose our
representatives

01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
the state understands that
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering is a pernicious process
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
as house bill of 1665-2020
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
and 706 in 2019 to set strict criteria
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
public input rules and an advisory
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
commission for redistributing both maybe
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
to the governor's success only to debut
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
without clear maps we are not living in
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
a true democracy without paramount your
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
constituents who are supposed to who you
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
are supposed to serve have their needs
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
ignored and unmet
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
without their math the next 10 years
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
we'll see even more politicization
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
polarization and disenfranchising
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
the people are angry and i am angry that
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
i have to fight for such a basic right
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
as having my voice be heard freely and
 
01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.109 align:start position:0%
as having my voice be heard freely and
fairly

01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
the redistricting committee has the
 
01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
power to change the current atmosphere
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
change the cold rough and dangerous
 
01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:38.950 align:start position:0%
change the cold rough and dangerous
partisanship

01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
partisanship
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
i am asking you to make new hampshire a
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
place that i would be happy and proud of
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
to raise your family give back to my
 
01:06:45.359 --> 01:06:46.630 align:start position:0%
to raise your family give back to my
community

01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
i'm asking for you to do your job serve
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
us your constituents we the people
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
instead of partisan politics
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your time for being here
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
i really just mean a lot and thank you
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
it's happened a couple of times in the
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
last house staff to have you removed if
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
before we go on
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
if you want to express an opinion there
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
are sign up sheets and anyone who signs
 
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
up will get a chance to talk
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
please be respectful
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
you know we are conducting business

01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
along the way i've met a range of people
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
from those who are excited to engage
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
with a random person
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
a candidate on their doorstep and talk
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%

about
 
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
to others who aren't paying this close
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
attention and tend not to involve
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
themselves in our referral process

candace

01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
candace
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
primarily stands out in my memory
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
precisely because he didn't fit into the
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
either category
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
after speaking with him for only a few
 
01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:48.470 align:start position:0%
after speaking with him for only a few
minutes

01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
in fact he pays very close attention to
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
what's going on around him and has some
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
very big concerns yet he intentionally
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
chooses to disengage from our electoral
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
process this immediately caught my
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
attention and i wanted to learn
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
shared with me that he passed his first
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
vote for ronald reagan back in november
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
1980 and continued on as a community
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
voter for several decades but that in
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
the last few years he'd become more and
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
more disillusioned with the state of our
 
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
government and politics at all levels
 
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
he felt convinced that he was powerless
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
to change things and that his vote was
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
useless especially to see in municipal
 
01:10:24.719 --> 01:10:26.149 align:start position:0%
useless especially to see in municipal
levels

01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
levels
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
i stood at the end of his driveway
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
clipboard and phone cards in hand for
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
easily 30 minutes engaged in a lively
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
discussion i did my very best to
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
convince him that in fact his vote does
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
count and that he shouldn't give up and
 
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
opt out of our most sacred and powerful
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
right the right
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
as i walked away i had little faith that
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
i hadn't really gained ground but was so
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
grateful nonetheless that he'd been
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
willing to somebody come with me
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
flash forward to september 21st
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
on primary day in manchester as i held
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
my post outside the polls during voters
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
you can imagine my surprise when i saw
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
her super barreling toward me waiting
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically to call attention to
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that he in fact showed up as
 
01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.229 align:start position:0%
the fact that he in fact showed up as
well

01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
this still makes me really happy
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
so why am i sharing a story of this one
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
single voter
 
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
because it's the christopher's of the
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
scene we need to keep front of mind when
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
considering how to approach the process
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
of redistricting here in around the
 
01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.709 align:start position:0%
of redistricting here in around the
state

01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
these people represent both the fragile
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
nature and the promise of our sacred
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
electoral process
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
he went from an active stalwart voter
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
to a disillusioned disengaged citizen
 
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
convinced that elected officials
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
prioritized politics and power over the
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
people they shouldn't listen to serve
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
for christopher had happened to the
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
well-timed encounter with a random
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
candidate in an arguably obscure
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
municipal primary race to convince him
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
to re-engage and to help restore his
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
faith in the system
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
the decisions in new orleans have
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
implications that span far beyond a
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
single driver conversation
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
imagine the impact a fair accessible
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
transparent register thing could have
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
for so many others out there that
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
christopher who may have little faith
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
left or trust in the system who may in
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
fact have rule fate or custom view the
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
public servants who've been elected to
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
carry out this system
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
you have the power by achieving a
 
01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
process that is transparent and
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
accessible by all to restore the faith
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
of so many and hopefully like
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
christopher bring them back into the
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
conversation rather than engineer a
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
system that keeps them cycling
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
i encourage you all to remember
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
the individuals to be committed to serve
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
and to please place public service over
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
politics and power
 
01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
voters thank you
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
um i am very disappointed i'm from
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
goffstown i'm from hillsborough county
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
and i need to tell you so far for any
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
county hearing this has been more what i
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
would consider almost deliberate
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
reaction well this can
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
this like this there could be an
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
uprising now like a little bit of
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
as i said one year there we go there's
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
our democracy right there we show nicely
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
done folks republicans
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
by showing everybody the same response
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's how we can show respect and some
 
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
speakers certainly may cause some of us
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
to have more of a reaction than others
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
but it is difficult for everyone to come
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
to the microphone to express their
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
opinion for their statement and we ask
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
that the reaction be the same um and i
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
the senate and the house have slightly
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
different rules and in order to expedite
 
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
this process we are conducting these
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
hearings together um and i thank you for
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
showing respect to everybody else who
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
has come here tonight by responding the
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
same way to what they say
 
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
um also signed up to speak tonight
 
01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.630 align:start position:0%

01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
was an excellent bill
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
um there were people here who championed
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
it and i i am very grateful to them
 
01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:09.910 align:start position:0%
it and i i am very grateful to them
um

01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
and i just want to call your attention
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
to the section called redistricting
 
01:24:14.239 --> 01:24:15.590 align:start position:0%
to the section called redistricting
criteria

01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
because i believe that if
 
01:24:17.679 --> 01:24:18.550 align:start position:0%
because i believe that if
you

01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
as the committee that when we line the
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
maps uses that redistricting criteria as
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
your guiding principle we will all end
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
up with fair maps and we will have the
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
outcome that all of us desire so please
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
when you are considering
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
uh the maps that you adore
 
01:24:38.719 --> 01:24:40.229 align:start position:0%
uh the maps that you adore
um

01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
look at what
 
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
appears in hp 706. now some of it is
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
very basic and essential and that is
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
that we comply with the constitution of
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
the united states that we comply with
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
the constitution of the state of new
 
01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:56.470 align:start position:0%
the constitution of the state of new
hampshire

01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
but also that districts shall form
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
single boundaries and shall not be
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
bisected or otherwise divided by other
 
01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:05.750 align:start position:0%
bisected or otherwise divided by other
districts

01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
districts shall be drawn in compact
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
shapes and shall avoid jagged edges and
 
01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.229 align:start position:0%
shapes and shall avoid jagged edges and
extensions

01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
extensions
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
commissioners shall consider the
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
integrity of communities of interest to
 
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
the extent practicable
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
and this is really important and you've
 
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
heard people here tonight talk about
 
01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:29.990 align:start position:0%
heard people here tonight talk about
um

01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
how to
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh engage the
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
different communities and look at them
 
01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:38.639 align:start position:0%
so that life is being put with life so
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
that when people go to vote they are
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
voting for the interests of the people
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
in those communities um
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
the similarities of interest including
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
but not limited to racial ethnic
 
01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
economic social cultural geographic and
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
historic identities
 
01:25:58.639 --> 01:25:59.830 align:start position:0%
historic identities
um

01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
i also
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
the next section in um
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
bill that i'm referring to talks those
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
the ones i just mentioned on the jews
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
and then there are the demons and that
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
is that no
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
redistricting efforts should unduly
 
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
favor or disfavor a particular party nor
 
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
should it unduly favor or disfavor um
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
allowing people
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
of a particular language group or racial
 
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
group so i think that if everyone
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
everyone involved in the redistricting
 
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%

both for the members of the committee
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
and for the people who choose to show up
 
01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:42.800 align:start position:0%

01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:45.760 align:start position:0%

01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
so i think what we're hearing
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
is a very
 
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
we're hearing some very very clear
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
things tonight
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
in the testimony
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
and that is that people
 
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
want a fair
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
and non-partisan
 
01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:12.639 align:start position:0%
transparent process
 
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
um they want maps that represent
 
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
all granite staters
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm also hearing that we'd like to
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
see those maps
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
we'd like to release before the november
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
18th deadline and we'd like to have an
 
01:28:27.199 --> 01:28:28.629 align:start position:0%
18th deadline and we'd like to have an
opportunity

01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
to comment in a public way
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
on the record on those maps and to have
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
that be done
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
so that everyone can participate
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
ideally it would be across the state
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
with county hearings like this
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
but it should definitely also include
 
01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:51.910 align:start position:0%
but it should definitely also include
um

01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:55.110 --> 01:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
remote access and remote participation
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
and whatever we can do
 
01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:58.950 align:start position:0%
and whatever we can do
um

01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%

were aspects of that that were um
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
did not meet the requirements of the new
 
01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480 align:start position:0%

01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
faith
 
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
to heal the wounds that are dividing
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
this country
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's why i thought the non-partisan
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
independent commission is so important
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
but we can still achieve those same
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
things and those same goals
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
if this committee commits to
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
those principles and
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know you could go down in the
 
01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
history books
 
01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
because i know that both parties have
 
01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
participated in gerrymandering in our
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
state and across the nation
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
and and you all could be the ones that
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
break the move
 
01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
and and really make us proud in new
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire so thank you for the work
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
you're doing i know it's hard work um
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
and i do really appreciate all the time
 
01:31:12.149 --> 01:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
and effort that you put into it
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
and i do look forward to seeing those
 
01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
maps so as soon as you can get into us
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
and uh as soon as we get a chance to
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
comment on them and i'd love to be so
 
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
resumed uh that would be great thanks so
 
01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:24.950 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
yes good
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%

this hearing
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
um i don't want to repeat um much of
 
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
what has been said i had a couple of
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
things i did want to add
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
one instead of very shortly
 
01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:01.350 align:start position:0%
one instead of very shortly
okay

01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:07.030 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
yes thanks
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to say and listening to
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
some of the folks that have come up here
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
already this evening
 
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
um expressing their concern and also
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
their dismay
 
01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:19.910 align:start position:0%
their dismay
um

01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
that i
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
i'm harping back to my
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh my professional life as a project
 
01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:26.950 align:start position:0%
uh my professional life as a project
manager

01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
manager
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
and when
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
i would manage large
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
amorphous projects software projects
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
the way we would approach something like
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
that is to define the criterion upfront
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
to find the outcomes we were trying to
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
achieve from
 
01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:42.790 align:start position:0%
achieve from
and

01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
concern from the public comes from the
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
fact that the field of that part of the
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
process what is being used to decide
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
what's important and what's not
 
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
important and how we're going to
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
redraw the maps so that they're an
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
improvement on what we have
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
it would be really helpful i think if
 
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
people had some idea of what was
 
01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:04.550 align:start position:0%
people had some idea of what was
motivating

01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
motivating
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee
 
01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.270 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee
and

01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
i know that many of us who are serving
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
are merely
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
excited community members who wanted to
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
be part of the process
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
even though it's a long and arduous
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
process that we go through in new
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire i believe that that process is
 
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
in service
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
to getting better outcomes to listening
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
to each other to figuring it out
 
01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
i applaud you for
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
sticking with it
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
but i did want to say that as a person
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
who is very uh interested in the process
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
and willing to give up my time to be
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
part of that process i was extremely
 
01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.470 align:start position:0%
part of that process i was extremely
disappointed

01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
disappointed
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
when the fair districting
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
bills that passed
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
through the house and senate
 
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
ended up with a veto because the veto
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
message itself said
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
that unelected bureaucrats should be
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
drawn to maps
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
and i am very aware from the processes
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
that i've been involved in as part of
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
the house science technology and energy
 
01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:09.350 align:start position:0%
the house science technology and energy
committee

01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
uh that new hampshire very often uses
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
volunteers of interest
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
people who are combined in terms of
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
having you know mixes of democrats and
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
republicans but also people who really
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
have no interest in politics and have
 
01:34:26.709 --> 01:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
more of an interest in whatever that
 
01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
process subject is
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
that is the way we do a lot of our
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
decision making and it it's the thing
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
that removes it from being political and
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
so i was really disappointed to see that
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
message because
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
i didn't think it was accurate
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
for what the intent of those goals was
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
so the last thing i'll say is that i
 
01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.310 align:start position:0%
so the last thing i'll say is that i
actually

01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
have experience with the ploterial
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
district i ran um twice
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
in my hometown of paulus new hampshire
 
01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:58.709 align:start position:0%
in my hometown of paulus new hampshire
and

01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
learned what it is to be beat bad
 
01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
um and then um i was asked to run in a
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
flotilla material district that came
 
01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:08.790 align:start position:0%
flotilla material district that came
about

01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
in 2011 which was silver district 40
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
paulus milford mont vernon and new
 
01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:15.350 align:start position:0%
paulus milford mont vernon and new
boston

01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
boston
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
and prior to that time when i first
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
started being aware of state politics
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
and being interested in running
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
the district in my town was hollison
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
brookline and hollis and brookline have
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
a cooperative school district for the
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
middle and high schools so
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
um it was a logical district and what it
 
01:35:38.229 --> 01:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
means is that the representatives
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
live in those towns and they also
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
participate in the school meetings the
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
town meetings and basically the issues
 
01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
of the communities
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
so it made really big sense
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
it was much harder to run
 
01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:54.229 align:start position:0%
it was much harder to run
in

01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
in districts all the way up route 13
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
that really didn't have any relationship
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
with the towns in between
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
and mont vernon and new boston the two
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
furthest towns
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
also make up hillsborough five so
 
01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
so two of the four towns were a separate
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
district as well
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
and so i went from representing 7 600
 
01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:17.109 align:start position:0%
and so i went from representing 7 600
people

01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh at that at the time of that
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
resistance then to 8 300 today because
 
01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
now i'm back in holliston because i
 
01:36:22.719 --> 01:36:26.870 align:start position:0%
now i'm back in holliston because i
figured

01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
under those circumstances but i went to
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
a district that had 33 000 people
 
01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:34.229 align:start position:0%
a district that had 33 000 people
so

01:36:34.229 --> 01:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
um that's a that's a huge difference
 
01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
the members of the communities that
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
actually shared the school district were
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
no longer related
 
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
and um and then the representatives
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
again are
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
working in different places and so their
 
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
attention is not always focused on the
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
things that the community is focused on
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
so that's something that i would ask you
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
to consider as you look at how you
 
01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:00.470 align:start position:0%
to consider as you look at how you
conjugate

01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
conjugate
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
towns that go together
 
01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:03.910 align:start position:0%
towns that go together
because

01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
there is a logic to what you share
 
01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
and i hope that that will that you will
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
create some outcomes based on criterion
 
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:19.830 align:start position:0%
 
thank

01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:37:34.710 --> 01:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:41.830 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
um i wanted to say thank you for having
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
this meeting tonight and i've had
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
something i want to say but also i
 
01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:49.530 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:56.160 align:start position:0%

01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:56.170 align:start position:0%

01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
tax dollars paid for
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
um what might end up happening if they
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a maps like is this we want
 
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
to stay in state house and own that home
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
and you know covers friends to come or
 
01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
based on 2022 and 2024 so we think about
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
moving i'd rather stay in new hampshire
 
01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:20.950 align:start position:0%
but um
[Music]

01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
but you know
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
we would have in that discussion you
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
know who you want to stay
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
also my mom is somebody who's in a
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
high-risk scheduler but this was so
 
01:38:33.189 --> 01:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
important that i'm here i did send an
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
email already to the committee and i was
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
going to read that but you already got
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
that and some of the stuff has already
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
been said
 
01:38:41.189 --> 01:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
i definitely do and underscore
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
and then also
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
the woman here in the grave who did all
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
that work with the spreadsheets i think
 
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
webinars are like the leading women
 
01:38:58.149 --> 01:38:58.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire voters open blockchain phone
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
calls anything set on for the numbers
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
i mean it's over so this is what's
 
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
important to me because you guys i think
 
01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:07.189 align:start position:0%
important to me because you guys i think
are

01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
you know more informed
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
and won't be able to draw those maps and
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
use that software that the gentleman
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
here said here you can take this and
 
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
plug in the numbers and use the software
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's not going to happen but this is
 
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
what's important to me and this is why
 
01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
so when i take the time and make the
 
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
effort to vote i want my vote and every
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
other grand estate is both to count
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
i don't want my vote for any other
 
01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:49.990 align:start position:0%
i don't want my vote for any other
grandstand

01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
grandstand
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
to be packed cracked
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
or journeyed
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire voters should pick their
 
01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
elected officials not the other way
 
01:39:57.920 --> 01:39:59.590 align:start position:0%
elected officials not the other way
around

01:39:59.590 --> 01:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:00.140 align:start position:0%
around

01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:00.150 align:start position:0%

01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
i respectfully request that through a
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
non-pilot process the redistricting
 
01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:32.149 align:start position:0%
non-pilot process the redistricting

01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
mapping
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
meets that gold standard that reflects
 
01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
me in the community which i vote
 
01:40:40.709 --> 01:40:40.719 align:start position:0%
the will of the enhancer
 
01:40:40.719 --> 01:40:43.590 align:start position:0%

and i thank you for your time
 
01:40:47.109 --> 01:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
and for me that's what's important not
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
the numbers
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know not the you know community of
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
interest and all that stuff that i
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
learned in crash course or webinars
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
that's what's important to me that's why
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.040 align:start position:0%

my name is fred mayer i live in hudson i

work in nashville
 
01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
my wife and i have been here for new
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire over three decades
 
01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:25.750 align:start position:0%
hampshire over three decades
uh

01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of where we came from our
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
heart this is new hampshire we're here
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
for the duration
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the opportunity to speak
 
01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
this evening
 
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
but this process is a little a little
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
unusual for me
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh i'm an attorney i have had occasion
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
to go up the concrete to talk about
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
bills affecting the landlord and
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
lieutenant legislation because that's
 
01:41:49.590 --> 01:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
what i do
 
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
but when i do that that's why for those
 
01:41:51.679 --> 01:41:53.030 align:start position:0%
but when i do that that's why for those
committees

01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
i've had an opportunity to to read a
 
01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:56.149 align:start position:0%
i've had an opportunity to to read a
bill

01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
to come to reason conclusions about
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
what's good what's bad in that build
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
of course this evening there is no
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
build to leave
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
and more significantly there are no no
 
01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
masks to review
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
so there's no opportunity to determine
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
whether what's in the map is is good or
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
bad whether it's something i should
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
advocate for
 
01:42:22.709 --> 01:42:22.719 align:start position:0%
or or or real against
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
so consequently in the interest of
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
having a meaningful process
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
my request
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
is that you have a timetable
 
01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:33.750 align:start position:0%
is that you have a timetable
for

01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:34.950 align:start position:0%
for
hearings

01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
after maps are released
 
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
and in addition
 
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
i request that those hearings have
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
remote participation
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
i was fortunate enough
 
01:42:49.189 --> 01:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
to be able to come here this evening
 
01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679 align:start position:0%
but there are those who are disabled
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
those with health concerns

out of the interest of fairness
 
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
there should be more hearings
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
after maps are released
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%

uh for a timetable as to when the map

should be released uh within
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
30 days of the house going on both

congressional maps and the house maps
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
and to remote participation access i
 
01:43:59.430 --> 01:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
work a lot with young parents who have a
 
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
great deal of difficulty finding

affordable child care to participate in

these hearings
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
remote access would certainly make that
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
much more feasible to have their
 
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
important input especially when we look
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
at the impacts of education and
 
01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
education funding in the state and how
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
efficient will be drawn
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh those folks have a very vested
 
01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
interest in this process
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh and with that i think i think fred
 
01:44:22.950 --> 01:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
did a pretty good job on some of the
 
01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0%

for one thing
 
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
i think we should respect the rules that
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
the rules are reasonable and i think
 
01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
they were tonight so
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of a public school feature from

so i'm hoping that you'll
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
be able to listen to the input better
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
this time and
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
incorporate it into your decision making
 
01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:39.990 align:start position:0%
incorporate it into your decision making
um

01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
i believe the constitution of the
 
01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
state says
 
01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:45.910 align:start position:0%
state says
that

01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
if the town has a population large
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
enough to have a representative we
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
should have a representative of our own
 
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
where is large enough that about 9 000.
 
01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:55.030 align:start position:0%
where is large enough that about 9 000.
so

01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:55.990 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
i think that would be a case for a lot
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
of if we didn't get our own
 
01:46:00.639 --> 01:46:02.229 align:start position:0%
of if we didn't get our own
um

01:46:02.229 --> 01:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
i also want to see those maps um so that
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
then you can give
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
meaningful employment if you had a piece
 
01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%

01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:12.190 align:start position:0%

the districts are drawn in a way that is

unfair clearly
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
there will be lawsuits that takes time i
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
think it would save a lot of time

if the districts

were fair and reasonable

when you go
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
this still may be some other suggestions

um i'm here specifically to raise an
 
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
issue that i've faced in amherst where i
 
01:47:22.709 --> 01:47:22.719 align:start position:0%
find that we are actually districted
 
01:47:22.719 --> 01:47:23.430 align:start position:0%
find that we are actually districted
with

01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
venture our northern neighbor despite
 
01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
most of our population being centered in
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
the southern half of our town
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
um i think that this really doesn't help
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
us at all it doesn't help that for
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
either i think that we have better
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
solutions to our district things such as
 
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
montgomery um who is currently
 
01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:41.440 align:start position:0%

cooperative school
 
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh and i agree with most sentiments in
 
01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
here about
 
01:47:47.119 --> 01:47:48.709 align:start position:0%
here about
having

01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
an open discussion for
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
the maps after they are actually
 
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
released rather than us having to speak

on something that does not yet
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
exist to us and has just been an idea to
 
01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
us um thank you for your time and i'd
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
also appreciate it if you understood
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
that one of the constituents that are
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%

thank you for
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak i'm not super
 
01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable um being here
 
01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
but uh i did send it written testimony
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
but i also felt it was very important
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
for me to
 
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
um be brave enough to um talk to people
 
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
to you all um so i have great faith in
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
all of you and i have great faith in the
 
01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:46.400 align:start position:0%

01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:47.430 align:start position:0%
legislature the last two sessions they
did

01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
um vote for a fair commission and got
 
01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
shut down by the governor and um i'm
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
sorry about that happening but i have
 
01:48:57.590 --> 01:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
great faith in all of you
 
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
i'm a former school teacher and we
 
01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
civics was very important to me my last
 
01:49:04.709 --> 01:49:04.719 align:start position:0%
year of teaching
 
01:49:06.629 --> 01:49:06.639 align:start position:0%

01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
why don't more americans vote
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
we dug deep into that um with the help
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:49:16.709 --> 01:49:16.719 align:start position:0%
civics institute that
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
runs teaching workshops and so forth um
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
but i think that the fair mapping
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
project is part of that
 
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
people feel that their vote is not going
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
to count they become disengaged and i
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't care who you're voting for i just
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
want everyone to be able to vote that is
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
eligible and i want their vote to help
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
um i'd love to see our
 
01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:40.229 align:start position:0%
um i'd love to see our
american

01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
american
 
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
voting percentage go up on
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
big time in others um
 
01:49:45.679 --> 01:49:46.470 align:start position:0%
big time in others um
so

01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
um i agree with lots of things that have
 
01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
been said tonight um and you have been
 
01:49:52.709 --> 01:49:52.719 align:start position:0%
asked the same thing over and over and
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
over but one thing that i would like to
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
pay particular attention to
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
is the executive council mapping um
 
01:50:02.229 --> 01:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
that's a very powerful group of five
 
01:50:02.239 --> 01:50:03.189 align:start position:0%
that's a very powerful group of five
people

01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:50:03.199 --> 01:50:03.990 align:start position:0%
people
and

01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
um it's very important that the
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
districts are drawn so that
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
each party candidate republican democrat
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
whoever else might be on the ticket has
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
a fair shot of getting elected
 
01:50:18.239 --> 01:50:19.910 align:start position:0%
a fair shot of getting elected
um

01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:22.229 --> 01:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
so i just ask you to pay special
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
attention to that um
 
01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:25.910 align:start position:0%
attention to that um
i

01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:50:29.109 --> 01:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
also work very hard to get more people
 
01:50:31.589 --> 01:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
engaged in this democratic process
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's sending public hearings in
 
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
conquering or writing on the editor or
 
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
just just participate it's going to take
 
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
every single one of us
 
01:50:41.669 --> 01:50:41.679 align:start position:0%
and i spent a lot of time
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
gathering and
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
talking with friends to try to get them
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
to come first to the september 30th
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
meeting and then and then
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
say hey you have more time i think i can
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
the questions were right well i don't
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
know what to say i don't know what i'm
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to comment on and so forth so
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
people don't know how to give you their
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
input because they don't know what their
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
colors are so i do in fact ask that
 
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
um the draft of the maps are presented
 
01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
to the public and the public has ample
 
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
time to look them over and voice their
 
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
input once the those maps are done as
 
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
well as the criteria or the data that's
 
01:51:27.669 --> 01:51:27.679 align:start position:0%
used to put those stuff together
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for your time
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
hello

01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
hello
 
01:51:46.709 --> 01:51:46.719 align:start position:0%
i'll start by thanking you all for
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
having these listening sessions in every
 
01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
county if you're all busy as it is and
 
01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:53.050 align:start position:0%
taking that time has
 
01:51:53.050 --> 01:51:55.109 align:start position:0%
taking that time has
[Music]

01:51:55.109 --> 01:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
added more to your responsibilities but
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
obviously very important
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
this is a complicated
 
01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
effort is very important and as one of
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
the speakers just mentioned it's hard
 
01:52:05.599 --> 01:52:06.390 align:start position:0%
the speakers just mentioned it's hard
for

01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
the general public to wrap their brains
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
around how complicated this is
 
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
um especially with the house mapping and
 
01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
sticking with the code after the
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
um again i'm john crosman from brooklyn
 
01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
um back in 2010 our town was eligible
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
for its own uh house district that
 
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
didn't receive it so i'm hoping to see
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
that they will receive it
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
this year uh increased population
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
of course again there are some pretty uh
 
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
complicated experiences along the long
 
01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
road national area for the house
 
01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:39.270 align:start position:0%
road national area for the house
um

01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
i got involved with the mamathon effort
 
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
that is uh
 
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
led by an open democracy
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
back starting in the summer time
 
01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
we've had upwards of 150 people in our
 
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
room uh meetings
 
01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:54.790 align:start position:0%
room uh meetings
and

01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:57.669 --> 01:52:57.679 align:start position:0%
those people have represented
 
01:52:59.669 --> 01:52:59.679 align:start position:0%
every region of the state
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
so we've had good representation in
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
terms of the interests and
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
importance that the public sees in this
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
as part of that effort we came up with
 
01:53:13.189 --> 01:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
some communities of interest
 
01:53:13.199 --> 01:53:13.910 align:start position:0%
some communities of interest
and

01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
endeavored to
 
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
see if we could create maps that
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
respected these communities of interest
 
01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:23.109 align:start position:0%
and also
achieved

01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
achieved
 
01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
all the requirements of the
 
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
federal state constitutions and of
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
the main communities and interests that
 
01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
we came up with were high school saus
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
public health regions regional planning
 
01:53:39.119 --> 01:53:40.390 align:start position:0%
public health regions regional planning
commissions

01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
shared water and sewer
 
01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:44.790 align:start position:0%
shared water and sewer
communities

01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh shared police and fire services
 
01:53:48.629 --> 01:53:48.639 align:start position:0%
between communities
 
01:53:48.639 --> 01:53:49.510 align:start position:0%
between communities
and

01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
there are a number of social issues like
 
01:53:54.629 --> 01:53:54.639 align:start position:0%
pfas and opioid addiction
 
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
other things of that nature
 
01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:00.070 align:start position:0%
other things of that nature
um

01:54:00.070 --> 01:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
that we were able to sort of
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
aggregate all together and so using a
 
01:54:07.270 --> 01:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
social vulnerability index
 
01:54:09.669 --> 01:54:09.679 align:start position:0%
that you might be familiar with
 
01:54:12.390 --> 01:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
so that is also another
 
01:54:14.070 --> 01:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh i wouldn't necessarily call it a
 
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
community of interest but a uh
 
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
constraint that we're
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
trying to respect uh our maps
 
01:54:21.199 --> 01:54:22.629 align:start position:0%
trying to respect uh our maps
um

01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:24.629 --> 01:54:24.639 align:start position:0%
along with the effort of creating
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
communities and interests
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
we also created a pretty complex
 
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
analysis tool to use to
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
take a map that we've drawn typically in
 
01:54:36.550 --> 01:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
phase redistricting the
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
free mapping software
 
01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
we can export that map pull it into this
 
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
analysis tool
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
and it will automatically tell us if
 
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
counties have been displayed cities have
 
01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
been displayed if we split any of these
 
01:54:50.070 --> 01:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
public health regions or regional
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
planning commissions or any of the other
 
01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:52.709 align:start position:0%
planning commissions or any of the other
clis

01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
clis
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
um so we've done this uh with the intent
 
01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
of analyzing the 2010 maps to create a
 
01:54:58.159 --> 01:54:59.350 align:start position:0%
of analyzing the 2010 maps to create a
baseline

01:54:59.350 --> 01:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
baseline
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
create our own maps and then we'll
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
analyze those maps and compare how well
 
01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
they do in performance to the 2010 maps
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
and then we're also looking forward to
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
analyzing whatever maps you guys uh come
 
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
and also by the way i want to point out
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
that this effort has been done with
 
01:55:21.189 --> 01:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
utmost um
 
01:55:21.199 --> 01:55:22.149 align:start position:0%
utmost um
uh

01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
priority in being completely transparent
 
01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:26.229 align:start position:0%
priority in being completely transparent
so

01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
how we develop the progression from the
 
01:55:29.669 --> 01:55:29.679 align:start position:0%
initial list of communities of interest
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
to the to the five or six that we
 
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
settled on we have a
 
01:55:36.149 --> 01:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
history of our meetings
 
01:55:37.589 --> 01:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
how we
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
got to that point
 
01:55:40.709 --> 01:55:40.719 align:start position:0%
this analysis tool that we've created is
 
01:55:42.629 --> 01:55:42.639 align:start position:0%
in microsoft excel
 
01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
it uses
 
01:55:46.229 --> 01:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
only worksheet functions no visual basic
 
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
macros or anything like that so anybody
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
who's familiar with worksheet functions
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
can go in and audit our tools and see
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
exactly how we're doing these
 
01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:54.870 align:start position:0%
exactly how we're doing these
calculations

01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
calculations
 
01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:56.470 align:start position:0%
calculations
um

01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:58.950 --> 01:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
the initial maps to be developed and i
 
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
think a bunch of them are outside right
 
01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:01.270 align:start position:0%
think a bunch of them are outside right
now

01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:04.149 align:start position:0%
now
um

01:56:04.149 --> 01:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
respects all of the cois
 
01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:07.830 align:start position:0%
respects all of the cois
more

01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
so and and some for some of the clies
 
01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
with a much greater magnitude
 
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh from the 2010 maps that we analyzed
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
and we did that
 
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
while yielding
 
01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
at least the same uh or better
 
01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
population deviation
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
and also competitiveness and the way we
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
analyze competitiveness is using 2020
 
01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
election data for the specific
 
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
legislative body the map would be drawn
 
01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:35.669 align:start position:0%
legislative body the map would be drawn
for

01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:35.679 --> 01:56:36.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:56:36.629 --> 01:56:36.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
and on top of all that we came up with a
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
hillsborough map our leading contender
 
01:56:44.229 --> 01:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
right now has two less violations than
 
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
the 2010 map
 
01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
so we were able to
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
create these community communities of
 
01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:50.790 align:start position:0%
create these community communities of
interest

01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:56:53.669 --> 01:56:53.679 align:start position:0%
which give us some legitimate
 
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
guidelines to creating communities and
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
we were able to create maps that were
 
01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
just as good or better in 2010 apps
 
01:57:04.229 --> 01:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
and pretty much every regard
 
01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
so it is possible i understand it's
 
01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:07.669 align:start position:0%
so it is possible i understand it's
complicated

01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
but it is possible
 
01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:13.910 align:start position:0%
but it is possible
um

01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
i i also wanted to add that of course if
 
01:57:17.990 --> 01:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
it wasn't implied already
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're completely at your service open
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
democracy and the navathon team
 
01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:23.270 align:start position:0%
democracy and the navathon team
are

01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
willing to sit down with any of you and
 
01:57:26.310 --> 01:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
go through our maps show you how we're
 
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
analyzing them we'd love to be in
 
01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:29.270 align:start position:0%
analyzing them we'd love to be in
service

01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:30.790 align:start position:0%
service
um

01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i heard at the
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
last i think is the most recent house
 
01:57:36.790 --> 01:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
special committee uh meeting
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
was that there was a possibility that
 
01:57:42.149 --> 01:57:42.159 align:start position:0%
reducing the state reps to 391 would
 
01:57:42.159 --> 01:57:43.189 align:start position:0%
reducing the state reps to 391 would
yield

01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
yield
 
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
lower deviations by counting
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
um we started looking into that and we
 
01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:48.470 align:start position:0%
um we started looking into that and we
agree

01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
agree
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
up to this point
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
there are a few additional dimensions of
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
that analysis that we have yet to
 
01:57:54.239 --> 01:57:55.189 align:start position:0%
that analysis that we have yet to
complete

01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
complete
 
01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
but i would uh
 
01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
really urge you
 
01:58:01.270 --> 01:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
to use the flexibility
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
our state constitution that gives us a
 
01:58:05.189 --> 01:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
range of state reps to really look at
 
01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
that 391 number
 
01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:09.510 align:start position:0%
that 391 number
um

01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
and then lastly i just want to reiterate
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
it was what was mentioned earlier
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
um of course
 
01:58:17.189 --> 01:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think these meetings were
 
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
scheduled originally again i'm glad that
 
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
you guys scheduled them
 
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
it would make no sense for the public to
 
01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
not have the opportunity to review your
 
01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:26.550 align:start position:0%
not have the opportunity to review your
maps

01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
maps
 
01:58:29.189 --> 01:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
um before they are locked in one way or
 
01:58:29.199 --> 01:58:30.390 align:start position:0%
um before they are locked in one way or
another

01:58:30.390 --> 01:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:58:32.070 --> 01:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
so i urge you to make
 
01:58:33.910 --> 01:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
your maps available i know i know
 
01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
there's a strict timeline here and it's
 
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
gonna take some time to get those maps
 
01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:38.870 align:start position:0%
gonna take some time to get those maps
published

01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
published
 
01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
i along with everyone else here would
 
01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate to be able to see them and
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
provide comments
 
01:58:46.709 --> 01:58:46.719 align:start position:0%
even not just a listening session and we
 
01:58:50.180 --> 01:58:50.190 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:50.190 --> 01:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:58:58.480 --> 01:58:58.490 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:58.490 --> 01:59:01.669 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:03.510 --> 01:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
there's every possible way to make that
 
01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:04.870 align:start position:0%
there's every possible way to make that
happen

01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much
 
01:59:31.589 --> 01:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:31.599 --> 01:59:32.390 align:start position:0%
 
hi

01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
hi
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
i'm betty vaughn i live in linchfield
 
01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:59:38.070 --> 01:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
i put my name down before that woman
 
01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:42.149 align:start position:0%
i put my name down before that woman
spoke

01:59:42.149 --> 01:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
spoke
 
01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
about the executive council that's
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
really why i hope they've done because
 
01:59:45.599 --> 01:59:46.870 align:start position:0%
really why i hope they've done because
um

01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
i feel like it's really important i also
 
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
want to do a little webinar because they
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
talked about that um
 
01:59:54.390 --> 01:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:59:57.830 --> 01:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
it seems it's this sort of line
 
02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
across the state that
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
causes um
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:00:07.589 --> 02:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
for people to potentially be
 
02:00:07.599 --> 02:00:09.669 align:start position:0%
for people to potentially be
conservative

02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
conservative
 
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
for us to be
 
02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
more liberal which is kind of what's
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
happening now so that's really
 
02:00:17.589 --> 02:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
my concern is um
 
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
the executive council
 
02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
and also i live in the field
 
02:00:23.199 --> 02:00:24.629 align:start position:0%
and also i live in the field
well

02:00:24.629 --> 02:00:24.639 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
i'm a democrat so i use no matter what
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
happens so
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
um i think the reason that
 
02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
the this
 
02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:36.310 align:start position:0%
the this
manchester

02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
is to
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
make more manchester
 
02:00:42.629 --> 02:00:42.639 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:00:43.750 --> 02:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
i just
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that and
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%

speak tonight
 
02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
the reason that i'm speaking tonight is
 
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
because for me
 
02:01:42.629 --> 02:01:42.639 align:start position:0%
the most important thing is to represent
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
our people
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
to represent who put us in the secret
 
02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
that we have right now
 
02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
i don't see anyone
 
02:01:54.070 --> 02:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
as a republican i don't see
 
02:01:56.550 --> 02:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
any of you as a democrat
 
02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
i see every one of you as a human being
 
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
and the only thing that i'm asking is to
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
have a fair representation
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
for my community
 
02:02:10.390 --> 02:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
and expenses last year
 
02:02:13.270 --> 02:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
our latino population growth
 
02:02:15.270 --> 02:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
and i would like to see
 
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
our community represented very well
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to education
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
is when it comes to
 
02:02:26.070 --> 02:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
mental health when it comes to
 
02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
many different areas
 
02:02:29.109 --> 02:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
that our communities are
 
02:02:29.119 --> 02:02:31.109 align:start position:0%
that our communities are
underrepresented

02:02:31.109 --> 02:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
underrepresented
 
02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing i'm asking
 
02:02:35.669 --> 02:02:35.679 align:start position:0%
i'm asking for fairness
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
i'm asking for our people to tell the
 
02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:38.550 align:start position:0%
i'm asking for our people to tell the
voice

02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
voice
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
and then to be honest i wish
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
our people can be here
 
02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
placing their voices
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of times
 
02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
we have people in our community that
 
02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:50.070 align:start position:0%
we have people in our community that
thinking

02:02:50.070 --> 02:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
30 40 years
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
my english is not perfect
 
02:02:57.189 --> 02:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
you know english is my second language
 
02:02:59.669 --> 02:02:59.679 align:start position:0%
i was born in los
 
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
almost 35 years
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes people make fun of me because
 
02:03:06.629 --> 02:03:06.639 align:start position:0%
i have a big problem as well besides
 
02:03:09.189 --> 02:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
being bilingual
 
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
but i wish our community can have a
 
02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:13.589 align:start position:0%
but i wish our community can have a
representation

02:03:13.589 --> 02:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
representation
 
02:03:14.950 --> 02:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
they came
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
i know that we have a lot of good
 
02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
communicators but english is not the
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
person which i wish they we can help
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
them come and
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
represent our communities and someone
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
can get translated for them what they
 
02:03:30.070 --> 02:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
have to say about
 
02:03:32.550 --> 02:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
what their needs are for our communities
 
02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:33.750 align:start position:0%
what their needs are for our communities
um

02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:36.070 --> 02:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
the disabled community is another part
 
02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:38.719 align:start position:0%
that i keep hearing from people not just
 
02:03:40.870 --> 02:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
in the local community but around the
 
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
state to be honest i spent a lot of time
 
02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
i spent a lot of time
 
02:03:47.669 --> 02:03:47.679 align:start position:0%
traveling around the state because for
 
02:03:47.679 --> 02:03:48.629 align:start position:0%
traveling around the state because for
me

02:03:48.629 --> 02:03:48.639 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not just representing milford i feel
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
like i have to hear the voices of
 
02:03:55.030 --> 02:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
everyone in the city
 
02:03:57.270 --> 02:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
because in order for me to do the right
 
02:03:59.189 --> 02:03:59.199 align:start position:0%
thing in order for me to represent
 
02:04:01.830 --> 02:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
anyone in the state i have to travel all
 
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
over the state and listen to everyone no
 
02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
matter if your democrat will become or
 
02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:09.270 align:start position:0%
matter if your democrat will become or
undeclared

02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
undeclared
 
02:04:10.950 --> 02:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
so my
 
02:04:12.390 --> 02:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
02:04:15.189 --> 02:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
that we're not given the opportunity to
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%

02:04:19.270 --> 02:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
