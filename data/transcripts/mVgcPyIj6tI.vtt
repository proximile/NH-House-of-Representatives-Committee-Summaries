00:12:23.949 --> 00:12:23.959 align:start position:0%
uh welcome I'm opening the meeting on
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
the special committee um for Department
 
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
of Children family children Youth and
 
00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.189 align:start position:0%
of Children family children Youth and
Family

00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
we have um some of our members in
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
attendance today we don't have a full
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
full desk but that's all right um and we
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
have a very important person in the
 
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
audience as well so welcome welcome
 
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
representative kushman um so I'm GNA
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
open it up and I'm going to read the
 
00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
charges of our committee um and then
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to have uh just a little bit
 
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
of an oversight of where we've been as I
 
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
do that I will hand out these um
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
overviews of federal funding um title
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
for federal funding um just so that
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
people can have a copy of this this was
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
Panic so the charge for this committee
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
said that that this hereby established
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
special committee on the division for
 
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
children youth and families to consider
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
all matters pertaining to due process
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
and practices related to DCF the special
 
00:13:25.629 --> 00:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
committee shall consist of 10 members of
 
00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
the House who shall conduct hearings and
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
re receive testimony relative to DCF and
 
00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
may make recommendations for future
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
legislation so looking at our history we
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
heard lots of good testimony regarding
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
DC we heard from people who had
 
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
significant problems with the process
 
00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
and how it was handled we've reviewed
 
00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
information we've reviewed the way that
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
the depart the division has set up um
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
and as we mve through that quite frankly
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
we've realized that it's a strange
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
combination of laws rules and policies
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
that can be little hard to follow from
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
time to
 
00:14:06.269 --> 00:14:06.279 align:start position:0%
time we also may make recommendations
 
00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:08.759 align:start position:0%
for future legislation and reviewing the
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
lsrs I found that there are three that
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
are relative to um department of
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
children youth the division of children
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
youth and families the first is LSL LSR
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
35 that I've filed to establish as its
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
own state agency a department for
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
children youth and families um I filed
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
that one I'm still working on the
 
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
language is something that I can share
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
with all of you when I have it um but
 
00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
it's my view that that'll provide
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
greater oversight and greater
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
transparency uh representative Spain has
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
filed LSR 65 I I'm guessing it's a
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
refiling although I haven't looked at
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
the haven't asked him about the text
 
00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
that's relative to the penalty for
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
filing false reports and representative
 
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
love has filed uh LSR 139 which uh by
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
the title says that it would require DCF
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
to notify law enfor enforcement officers
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
of assaults and and um attempted I
 
00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:05.959 align:start position:0%
believe attempted assaults on children
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
assaults on children yes so um with
 
00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:11.079 align:start position:0%
those I don't think we have the text of
 
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
any of those but that does look like
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
it's some work that's moving forward for
 
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
legislation regarding
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
dcyf um yes what was the number of that
 
00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:24.519 align:start position:0%
139 thank
 
00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
you and um with that I know that in mine
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
including d process has a fundamental
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
practice within DC the department of DCF
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
is key to my legislation making sure
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
that that is respected throughout the
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
process and um quite frankly having
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
assaults um fonus assaults on children
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
actually reported to the police is also
 
00:15:48.309 --> 00:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
due process because while you may be
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with that as a family off Family
 
00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:52.519 align:start position:0%
issue you shouldn't be able to punch a
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
child in the face without talking to a
 
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
police officer and dealing with those
 
00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
consequences quite frankly um so the
 
00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
question would be if anybody else here
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
is drafting legislation that they would
 
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:10.759 align:start position:0%
discuss okay oh yes yes if you put that
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
on um you can ask a question I did have
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
a question um last term or last year uh
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
representative Hull had presented a same
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
uh similar legislation to yours as far
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
as DCF pulling away from DHHS is it
 
00:16:27.309 --> 00:16:27.319 align:start position:0%
going along in that same mindset is is
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
it does it read the same um thank you
 
00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
for the question no it does not that
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
sort of highlights how few statutes
 
00:16:35.309 --> 00:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
actually refer to the division for
 
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
children youth and families in our laws
 
00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
um which is one of the challenges
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
regarding oversight that did have an
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
interesting conversation um where the
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner and the then acting
 
00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
uh dcyf director spoke about the various
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
oversight and
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
transparency um so they report to the
 
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
children's oversight committee monthly
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
they report to HHS oversight
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
occasionally um the Office of the child
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
advocate has oversight um
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
responsibilities relative to the
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
children there's the Family Division
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
Circuit of the circuit court that has an
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
interaction there's Casa that has
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
interaction and there's the government
 
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
and Council that has
 
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
interaction um to me quite frankly
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
having such a large constellation of
 
00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:20.919 align:start position:0%
oversight may have some conflicts within
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
it so I think that moving forward in the
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
process it would be interesting to see
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
where those interactions are and if
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
diffuse oversight is helpful or may
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
actually lead to different things that
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
are lost in in the scuel um I think as
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
far as when you look at good management
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
at least outside of government you want
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure you're not reporting to too
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
many different um oversight areas um but
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll be able to look at that and
 
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
see and I think that that would be an
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
important discussion moving forward but
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
that is what stopped that bill from
 
00:17:51.789 --> 00:17:51.799 align:start position:0%
moving forward in committee when I
 
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
looked at the testimony um that and a
 
00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:56.919 align:start position:0%
pretty interesting fiscal note so I've
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
spoken to the legislative budget uh
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
office as well and um I'm looking to get
 
00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
a better understanding of the details
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
surrounding that because filing the same
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
bill again is not necessar not the most
 
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
productive process in my mind unless
 
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
it's one where it's clear it's distinct
 
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
and it's small um or at least easily
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:23.149 --> 00:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
you um and then so I'd like to ask the
 
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee if any of you
 
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
have received specific requests for
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
legislation from the public to discuss I
 
00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:30.919 align:start position:0%
know heard about the large big p picture
 
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
issues but it's kind of hard to take all
 
00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:35.559 align:start position:0%
of that and then translate it down to an
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
action especially when we only have a
 
00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
few statutes which actually refer to
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
DCF representative Weber well this isn't
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
directly responsive to the question
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
because the answer is no I have not had
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
anybody in the public uh speak to me
 
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.870 align:start position:0%
anybody in the public uh speak to me
about

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
DCF um
 
00:19:00.149 --> 00:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
the concern that I have and and I think
 
00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
it's it's um always worth discussing
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
whether and and certainly we've had any
 
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
number of discussions in the past about
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh whether D DHHS as a whole is too
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
large and whether dcyf specifically
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
ought to um be broken
 
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
off um and that has implications both
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
for the oversight and management side of
 
00:19:28.149 --> 00:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
things and the fiscal side of things uh
 
00:19:28.159 --> 00:19:29.750 align:start position:0%
things and the fiscal side of things uh
but

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
here's the thing that I find is always
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
the nub of this matter and it's why in
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
in a vacuum I find it really hard to say
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
oh I'm I'm for that or I'm not for that
 
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
I think it's a very good subject for
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
discussion and I think discussions are
 
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
of that kind of issue are always
 
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
productive the thing that is terribly
 
00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
terribly difficult is the
 
00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:55.750 align:start position:0%
terribly difficult is the
tension

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
tension
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
between on the one hand the rights of
 
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
parents which we want to protect and on
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
the other hand the rights of children
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
which we want to protect and The Clash
 
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559 align:start position:0%
of two fundamental constitutional rights
 
00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:13.390 align:start position:0%
of two fundamental constitutional rights
is

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
always a difficult area and it's a
 
00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
difficult area to get it right because
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's easy to take one case and
 
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
say that was wrong because it was and
 
00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:28.039 align:start position:0%
it's clear to all of us that something
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
happened that was
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
wrong taking that and codifying it in a
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
way that both prevents similar action
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
but does not impinge on other
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
fundamental act rights or make things
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
more difficult in some other area that
 
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
we didn't even imagine is the challenge
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
that we have and that's why I am um you
 
00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
know loath to think about anywhere that
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
anything that we could recommend as a
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
committee from what I have heard that I
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
can say
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
definitively wow this is one thing that
 
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
will really help out because the
 
00:21:17.149 --> 00:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
tensions come at those margins and where
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
you have fallible human beings trying to
 
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.350 align:start position:0%
you have fallible human beings trying to
operate

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
operate
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
within the scheme all of which is set up
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
to protect all kinds of different
 
00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:29.559 align:start position:0%
interests at all kinds of different
 
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
levels so
 
00:21:35.789 --> 00:21:35.799 align:start position:0%
um nothing that I said there is any kind
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
of conclusion other than that I don't
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
we I don't think of anything that I
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
would be comfortable with us as a
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
committee saying gee we ought to
 
00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
definitely do that because a lot of what
 
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
we heard was individuals who in their
 
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.390 align:start position:0%
we heard was individuals who in their
individual

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.029 align:start position:0%
individual
case

00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
um might have an issue but that issue
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
isue first of all we didn't hear both
 
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
sides of the story and secondly uh the
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
issue um is so specific to that case
 
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
that I didn't discern a pattern that I
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
thought was actionable I have been on
 
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
other committees where we did discern
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
patterns and did recommend uh uh changes
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
in the statute and so that those
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
Communications would become more more
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
easy and simpler and I know there is
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
also another I will also say that I'm
 
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
also on a um uh committee headed by
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
Senator Ward which is looking at access
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
to confidential medical records which
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
does impact this area
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
because that committee gets tied up in
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
the issue of well who who who gets to
 
00:22:55.149 --> 00:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
consent to the release of Records it's
 
00:22:58.029 --> 00:22:58.039 align:start position:0%
the parent well if the issue is whether
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
the parent
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
harmed a child they're not going to say
 
00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
yes and the other parent may not be
 
00:23:06.269 --> 00:23:06.279 align:start position:0%
available or may be too frightened so
 
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
then you have to get a court order and
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
how do you streamline that process and
 
00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
how do you once you've gotten the
 
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
records ensure that people can both dcyf
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
and law enforcement can share them back
 
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
and forth because you
 
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
can't or in some cases you can but it's
 
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
another set of statutes that
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
are not always understood so uh thank
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
you representative Weber those are good
 
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
points and I think that that's why it's
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
always challenging to make sure that
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
we're not responding to a particular
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
incident with legislation I've found so
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
many of these scattered throughout our
 
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
laws as though we had to do something
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
about this that then has unforeseen
 
00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
consequences uh but one of the things
 
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
that I did hear is I heard that there
 
00:23:53.549 --> 00:23:53.559 align:start position:0%
does seem to be um we've heard about
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
some of the real problem parents the
 
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
ones that have made the headlines the
 
00:23:59.230 --> 00:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
ones um
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the lost children and the
 
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
things that have happened with them so
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's the group on the extreme of
 
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
the these the the parents that that
 
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
really should have lost their rights to
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
their children and then on the other
 
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
side you have parents that are and
 
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
coming back from that towards the middle
 
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
you have parents who are very
 
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
experienced with these interactions they
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
know how to handle it they know how to
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
manage the interactions as they as they
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
manage the interactions they're able to
 
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps get away with a little bit more
 
00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
than some parents could and then you
 
00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
move towards the middle and pass there
 
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:35.559 align:start position:0%
and you find a naive parent who hears
 
00:24:37.149 --> 00:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
that somebody is coming to offer help
 
00:24:38.909 --> 00:24:38.919 align:start position:0%
and offers up all the information that
 
00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
you can just like the times of a
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
grandmother in some neighborhoods that
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
allow the police to come in and search
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
for somebody and then they find their
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
grandson's gun or drugs underneath the
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
sofa and now Grandma goes to jail and
 
00:24:52.389 --> 00:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
loses her house because she's on
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
section8 um and so we need to make sure
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
that our policies and procedures are
 
00:24:59.470 --> 00:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
protective of these naive well-meaning
 
00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
parents and ones who aren't naive
 
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
they're they're they understand what's
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
going on but they don't understand the
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
entire mechanism of it as well because
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
if we get to a it's a it's a very
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
delicate balance it's a very challenging
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
one that's why it's something that needs
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
to be dealt with as we move forward and
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
continue to improve on our processes uh
 
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
but I do think that making sure that
 
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
processes and policies are clear and
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
consistent throughout um even if you
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
take a different approach to somebody on
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
um this side who thinks it's okay to hit
 
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
a child who's strapped into a car seat
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
and this side who opens up everything
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
everything and just Bears their soul
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
whenever somebody comes to the door we
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
need to figure out some consistency
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
because I have heard very very
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
inconsistent treatment from parents and
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
families throughout the state based on
 
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
the perception of the families
 
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
perception of their abilities P
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
perception of their social status and
 
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
growing up with a neighbor who was
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
abused by his parents and his dad was on
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
a child abuse board I'm very very
 
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
cautious about the social proof clearing
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
somebody but also seeing other families
 
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
where it was a parent who was doing
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
their absolute best and loved their kids
 
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
desperately but the state stepped into
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
those that's our challenge to make sure
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
that the department is balancing this so
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's why I don't think that we're
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
ready to talk about any specifics on
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
these but I one of the major charges is
 
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
making recommendations for future
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
legislation and in my visioning of that
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know we may have something where we
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
say this is great we're all going to
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor this um I also might hit the
 
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
lottery today so I'm going to leave
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
everything as a opportunity I'm going to
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
leave all these possibilities open and I
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
hope that as we discuss these we can
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
find things that we can move forward and
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
agree upon but if not even if we move
 
00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
forward and say that some members of the
 
00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
committee thought this is was a good
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
Avenue to pursue While others had these
 
00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
concerns that will help also help the
 
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
process and if the bill is drafted and
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
introduced there'll be better
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
information for the committee that hears
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
it next term so that we can make sure we
 
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
have a more thorough process and we get
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
through these iterations of public
 
00:27:11.789 --> 00:27:11.799 align:start position:0%
comment faster so that we can come to a
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
conclusion and actually help out
 
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
families more
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
um so those are most of the parts that I
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to look at I definitely want to
 
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
um open it up to the other committee
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
members I know that representa Panic put
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
together this um information on title
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
core funding I can't take credit for
 
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
microphone representative Leah kushman
 
00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:40.519 align:start position:0%
sent that to me so she did all the work
 
00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
or AI did okay thank you thank
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
you I do have a question yes where we're
 
00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
getting one-sided
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
testimony how do we get DCF to come in
 
00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:57.559 align:start position:0%
here to testify because we're only
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
um so part of the challenge is some of
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
the interactions with the Department
 
00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
um a ceas and assist letter was not
 
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
helpful to cooperation from the
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
department and there's been no
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
information from them sense and since
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
there's no mechanism or process in order
 
00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
to compel appear appearance before
 
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
anybody of the legislature that's
 
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
something that has started us off with
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
one hand tied behind our back so it has
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
been challenging but I also understand
 
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
the depth of importance and emotion and
 
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
passion on this and we all perceive the
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
best that we can at the time as we know
 
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
but sometimes we don't know the Ripple
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
decision so if we move this committee
 
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.669 align:start position:0%
decision so if we move this committee
forward

00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:01.519 align:start position:0%
to another twoyear
 
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
session how do we get
 
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
DCF to come in otherwise we're still
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
going to just get a one-sided testimony
 
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
question I'd be interested in your
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
opinions on that and I'm I don't know if
 
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
the change of the legislature will
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
change that or not um all I know is we
 
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
can move forward as we can and get the
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
information that we can if we have a
 
00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
process in order to have more
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
information departments that will be
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
helpful um but that's one of the areas
 
00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559 align:start position:0%
that we need to determine I do know that
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
in some other states um there's
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
information that comes and they do have
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
an ability to question um but a lot of
 
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
that is set up to both chairman
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
discretion some of the states are set
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
with a very different Power structure
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
than we have here in our 400 person
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
house um so get to be a challenge
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative Weber well I'm just going
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
to say this straight out um
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
this committee was set up at the
 
00:30:03.509 --> 00:30:03.519 align:start position:0%
discretion of the current
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
speaker at the request of a
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
member with a very very specific goal
 
00:30:15.389 --> 00:30:15.399 align:start position:0%
and bent already built into its
 
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
charge and when we met the first couple
 
00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.630 align:start position:0%
charge and when we met the first couple
of

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
times it was very clear to me that the
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
view of what due process was in this
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
committee was going to be very very
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
different from what I learned about due
 
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
process in law school and what I believe
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
about due process from my reading of the
 
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
Constitutions and I think
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
that a committee that was established in
 
00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:51.190 align:start position:0%
that a committee that was established in
a

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
manner that was more open and clear
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
about the establishment and goals of the
 
00:30:57.639 --> 00:30:58.669 align:start position:0%
about the establishment and goals of the
commit

00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
commit
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
committee and the openness of the
 
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.149 align:start position:0%
committee and the openness of the
committee

00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
might be more
 
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
productive um I can't I can't talk from
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
anybody other than me but you know it's
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
been very difficult for me to sit and
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
listen to lecture after lecture from
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
people who tell me that unless there is
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
a jury trial in every single case a
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
court is illegitimate
 
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
I that that doesn't work for me um and
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
so I think that in many ways
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
the way the committee was
 
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
established was
 
00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.389 align:start position:0%
established was
um

00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
um already started the committee with a
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
perception that it might not
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
be a Level Playing Field and you know
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
that may be rightly or wrongly and it's
 
00:32:04.629 --> 00:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
certainly just my perception but it I
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
think we have had many many committees
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
that have worked very
 
00:32:16.269 --> 00:32:16.279 align:start position:0%
collaboratively um very openly and with
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
an enormous amount of cooperation of
 
00:32:22.029 --> 00:32:22.039 align:start position:0%
everybody involved and I think that
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
moving on to a different sort of forum
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
where that could happen again because it
 
00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
is happening in all the other committees
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
that deal with this subject it's just
 
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
this one so um I think that that is part
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
problem I would say that some of the
 
00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
other committees also do seem to have
 
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
people show up with one particular
 
00:32:46.629 --> 00:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
mindset and so it does not those those
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
committees even if there may not be as
 
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
much perceived descent with what's
 
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
happening in the state doesn't mean that
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
there aren't people that are still
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
concerned with it but they don't feel
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
that it'll be a valid forum for them to
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
express their views because when there's
 
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
already a great alignment between people
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
who are providing oversight to an agency
 
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
with the agency's actions um it feels it
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
feels ra almost sometimes even hostile
 
00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
to come and speak to a committee like
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
that um so we are hearing testimony that
 
00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
probably that didn't really come to any
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
others because they didn't feel that it
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
was a committee that wanted to listen to
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
those statements and while we have been
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
more one-sided because a variety of
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
issues we've heard very important very
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
important testimony because not
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
everybody comes and shares this
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
information and we do need to look to
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
all of these different issues and we
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
need to understand that while in this
 
00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
committee we're seeing more of one side
 
00:33:43.389 --> 00:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
of this there's other committees that
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
are also seeing more of the department
 
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
side that doesn't help us to have the
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
department show up to these particular
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
meetings but it does help to the greater
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
discourse around the area representative
 
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
love thanks for taking my I guess it's
 
00:33:59.310 --> 00:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
not a question but my my uh my
 
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
information uh you asked if any of us
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
any of us have been contacted by anyone
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
in the public and and I have I uh I was
 
00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:11.079 align:start position:0%
contacted by a grandmother who had uh
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
her her daughter had four
 
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
children and um the father of the of
 
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
three of the children uh came back into
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
their life and started abusing everybody
 
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
in the house and she went to get a um a
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
restraining order and the judge decided
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
that they should go to to DCF for
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
investigation well they uh they took the
 
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
three older ones and left her with the
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable and adopted them out to
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
a family in
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
Florida um the grandmother was supposed
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to have contact with them she
 
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%
hasn't had contact with them for quite a
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
while close to a year now uh they have
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
no idea where the kids are uh then
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
nobody will tell them um and I see here
 
00:34:58.109 --> 00:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
the uh the uh adoption it's a assistant
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
grants it it it kind of really reeks of
 
00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
the state is taking money
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh for for lack of a better word
 
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
stealing kids um you know I've I've
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
talked to to people that know the the
 
00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
the mother uh and she's not a bad mother
 
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
the kids are always clean and wellfed
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
and all that uh they are special needs
 
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
too and um you know boy it just reeks of
 
00:35:26.109 --> 00:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
something's really wrong here and um you
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
know nobody says anything and they pick
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
on people that have no money it seems we
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
we had one woman come in here and talked
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
about her her child uh being taken right
 
00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:37.400 align:start position:0%
off his bicycle okay another poor mother
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
didn't have much money um you know I I
 
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
one second representative love just
 
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
saying that you're picking on someone's
 
00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
kind of ascribing some motive to it so
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
if you could just tone that conversation
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
um you know but uh you know this this
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
grandmother was in tears and uh you know
 
00:35:56.109 --> 00:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
please do something and um you know like
 
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
I said she's uh they took the they they
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
left her with the most they left the the
 
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
mother with the most vulnerable you know
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
the child was three I think at the time
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
and uh and took the older ones you know
 
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
something isn't right there I just don't
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
you know the the policies the DC DCF
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
policies are all over the place you know
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
that they use it here they don't use it
 
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
over here they you know um we we had one
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
one guy come in here and he he said a a
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
statement that I heard myself 20 over 20
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
years ago okay no broken bones no
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
hospitalization risen much we can do
 
00:36:31.309 --> 00:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
when he said that yeah you know the
 
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
anger came back my my daughter had had
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
the hell beit out of her by her mother
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
okay and that's what I got you know
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
teachers turned her in doctors turned
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
her in I was just an Angry Dad okay they
 
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do anything okay the the dcyf
 
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
policies stink you know if if they if
 
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to use them if they're
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
going to apply them uniformly for
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
everybody fine but they don't and look
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
let's find out why thank you
 
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
representative love I think that the
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
equal application of the policies is
 
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical MH thank you
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
representa panic thank you um
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
chairman we're only hearing
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
one um side of the
 
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
coin and it's a very emotionally charged
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
side and it's so easy for all of us to
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
get swept up into it because it's
 
00:37:30.109 --> 00:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
we all care about children that's why
 
00:37:32.109 --> 00:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
we're here all
 
00:37:32.119 --> 00:37:34.950 align:start position:0%
we're here all
right

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
my concern
 
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
is how do we get what steps are we
 
00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
legally allowed to take to bring
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
DCF in here because I'm sure they have
 
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
their side of the story and once we hear
 
00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
it all this might make more sense to to
 
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
us all right I'm getting the feeling
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
we're getting a very
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
unbalanced uh
 
00:38:09.309 --> 00:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
testimony I but I'm we're not hearing
 
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
the other side of why they did what they
 
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
did and we have to be able to be able to
 
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
ask them those questions can and and I'm
 
00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.309 align:start position:0%
ask them those questions can and and I'm
not

00:38:22.309 --> 00:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
saying I'm not saying your side of the
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
story isn't correct I'm just trying to
 
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
find out what was the logic behind
 
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
DCF for doing what they're doing and
 
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
that would help us be able to see what
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
we can do to fix things all right
 
00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
because that that's the intentions here
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
can we subpoena a DCF to come
 
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:49.640 align:start position:0%
in um there is a POS a potential to do
 
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
that with the full vote of the house but
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
without any penalties for The subpoena
 
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
it's um I I feel like that's one of the
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
times when I tell my my kids that
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a consequence that I
 
00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:01.720 align:start position:0%
can't back up um and so I'm concerned
 
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
that requesting a subina that's not
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
complied with actually weakens the
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
position of the legislature but I do
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
believe that you brought up a very
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
important point right now we are hearing
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
a lot from the parents you know some
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
parents by the time they had children
 
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
and had the interactions weren't all
 
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
even all that many years removed from
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
being a child them themselves so the
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
idea of flipping from one side you're
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
fully protected you're a few years later
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
you're a child who's been vulnerable and
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
now you're a parent but now you're not
 
00:39:33.069 --> 00:39:33.079 align:start position:0%
seen you know that empathy seems to go
 
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
one way more than it goes two ways the
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
DCF has had every opportunity and every
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
invitation to come and speak to us they
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
have the ability to come and share their
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
side of the story they can't speak to
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
specific cases um a lot of that is
 
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
limited um we actually until recently
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
some of the cases even if you were the
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
parent you couldn't disclose so there's
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
been part of the issue too is that there
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
had sort of been a um little privacy
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
bubble secrecy bubble around proceedings
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
that had happened within DCF and that
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
may or may not have led to sort of
 
00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:09.079 align:start position:0%
policies being applied in one way in
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
some situations and another way in
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
another because we can't know because
 
00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
parents were charged with potential
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
violations for speaking about their
 
00:40:17.119 --> 00:40:18.670 align:start position:0%
violations for speaking about their
cases

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
um so there needs to my concern is that
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
with the diffuse oversight there are
 
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
some challenges there but I don't know
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
that that's something that we can look
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
can change how that oversight is done if
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to look at one of those
 
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
the particular charges that may actually
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
be a very helpful thing for us to look
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
and see specifically which oversight the
 
00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
children's oversight committee has I
 
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
know representative long um has been on
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
that for a long time um and
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
understanding what they do makes sense
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
but the parents also need to have their
 
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
voices heard everybody that I see here
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
listed is looking and representing the
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
side of the children um which is
 
00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
critical because they're vulnerable but
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
the parents also can be vulnerable
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative Walmer sorry
 
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I'm sorry okay I
 
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
used to say June and July
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
interchangeably on the trading floor and
 
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
that's not good with
 
00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.589 align:start position:0%
that's not good with
options

00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
options
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
um it I just wanted a point of
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
clarification because
 
00:41:23.069 --> 00:41:23.079 align:start position:0%
I don't know of a case in which parents
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
were prevented from speaking should they
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
choose to do so about their
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
DCF issues there are court
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
orders refusing that in the context of a
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
divorce and that's where we have
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
particularly had problems here in the
 
00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
legislature when one parent has come and
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
said this this this and this and then
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
somebody showed up with a court order
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
that says everything you just heard was
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
protected and and um under a
 
00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure order so I just I just
 
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I'm sure you probably
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
blocked from your memory as much as I
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
have our marathon session um two terms
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
ago when we were potentially going to
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
have to clean the lob ourselves because
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
we were staying so late on a deadline um
 
00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
there was amend an amendment within
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
there which um removed some of the
 
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:17.079 align:start position:0%
penalties for parents speaking about
 
00:42:19.549 --> 00:42:19.559 align:start position:0%
their cases in front of dcyf that one
 
00:42:22.829 --> 00:42:22.839 align:start position:0%
was not related to divorce plans um and
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
at this point my specific Recollections
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
are a bit hazy but um that sort of
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
Omnibus well I will defer that we had
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
had did didn't include that and um
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
listening to those changes it's just
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that we can also make sure
 
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
that the parents are heard and that they
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
are also supported in the process
 
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
because if our end goal is strong
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
families uh we can support both sides
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
and hopefully have stronger families
 
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
without only supporting one
 
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
side but the devil's in the details and
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
how do we do
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
that uh so to let you know what I think
 
00:42:59.230 --> 00:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
that our next meeting should entail I
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
will be presenting an overview of the
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
structure of dcyf including laws rules
 
00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
and policies and sort of how they
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
interact an overview of the
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
organizational structure um hopefully
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
I'll have some more information on
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
legislation to share and if there's
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
anybody else with specific legislative
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
language we can speak about that um but
 
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that we sort of
 
00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:22.559 align:start position:0%
put a pin in how dcyf looks at this
 
00:43:26.549 --> 00:43:26.559 align:start position:0%
point and understands that so um I don't
 
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
know if any other other committee
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
members um have something to say at this
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
point I was going to then see if anybody
 
00:43:33.549 --> 00:43:33.559 align:start position:0%
who's um joined us today wanted to
 
00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
address us with any information
 
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.150 align:start position:0%
address us with any information
representative

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
who given that we are very late in the
 
00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:43.880 align:start position:0%
legislative session that this will be a
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
lame duck um legislature starting in
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
less than three
 
00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
weeks I am wondering what the purpose is
 
00:43:58.349 --> 00:43:58.359 align:start position:0%
is of starting with an overview
 
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
of that which we perhaps might ought to
 
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
have had an overview of in the very
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
beginning but why are we doing it now
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
because this committee will end in
 
00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:12.559 align:start position:0%
December with the new legislature yes um
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
I was not looking to give a very
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
intricate and detailed overview but to
 
00:44:20.109 --> 00:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
present the information of the breakdown
 
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
the structures and sort of how they
 
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
interact at a high level 30,000 foot um
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
so that we could look at it in 5 to 10
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
minutes to understand at least which
 
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
pieces go where in the 24 piece puzzle
 
00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
not the 2400 piece puzzle um this is one
 
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
of the areas where understanding what is
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
included within
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
DCF and how they're overseen is helpful
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
to understand whether moving to um a
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
stand more Standalone process even if it
 
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
is a more distinct and legislatively
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
outlined um subunit of DHHS because
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
right now there is very very L very
 
00:44:59.599 --> 00:45:00.390 align:start position:0%
right now there is very very L very
little

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
little
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
legislation um that outlines the
 
00:45:04.829 --> 00:45:04.839 align:start position:0%
specifics most of it is up to the
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
discretion of the commissioner um most
 
00:45:08.109 --> 00:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Health and Human
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
Services is where the power is given to
 
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner to create uh whatever
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
is necessary in order to fulfill their
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
duties and um my view is that by
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
outlining that more distinctly in
 
00:45:22.349 --> 00:45:22.359 align:start position:0%
legislation would help us to provide
 
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
greater o oversight because if we have
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
not created the laws surrounding it it's
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
hard for the legislature to provide
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
oversight you may disagree with me but I
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
won't no I'm just trying to I'm just
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify because of course
 
00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
anybody has the right to introduce any
 
00:45:39.549 --> 00:45:39.559 align:start position:0%
legislation they want to and I think
 
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
that that is good and helpful and and
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
Prov thought-provoking which is very
 
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
useful um
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
and what I am asking
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
is a clarification now because you said
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
you wanted to present an overview of how
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
dcyf works works and then I heard you
 
00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
saying with an eye to new
 
00:46:02.359 --> 00:46:03.990 align:start position:0%
saying with an eye to new
legislation

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
and again I'm I'm wondering at this
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
point so to clarify that the new
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
legislation would be separate because
 
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
one of our main charges is to um provide
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
input on future legislation and so I
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
would give the small short summary
 
00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
usually when I'm speak speaking not in
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
the meeting I try and keep things short
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
um which would be my intention here
 
00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:27.559 align:start position:0%
because if I talk too long long I bore
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
myself and I know that most people get
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
so so by doing that and trying to
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
understand and quite frankly it is such
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
a nebulous division that it's been
 
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
difficult for me to really understand
 
00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
that structure and given the work that
 
00:46:50.549 --> 00:46:50.559 align:start position:0%
I've done in my past the things that
 
00:46:52.589 --> 00:46:52.599 align:start position:0%
I've done I feel that if I have trouble
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that structure and how it
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
interacts with each other um I either
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
need to be able to figure figure out how
 
00:46:59.549 --> 00:46:59.559 align:start position:0%
to explain it succinctly or we have
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
larger problems and I think I've reached
 
00:47:02.829 --> 00:47:02.839 align:start position:0%
the point where I may be able to get
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
those interactions and understand them
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
better so if you feel that I'm making
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
you part of my thought on exercise I
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
apologize but uh I I will share the
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
information with everybody ahead of time
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm just not sure why this
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
committee needs to do that if we're not
 
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the legislation we're only
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
looking at the structure and we are
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
within 3 weeks of the end
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
of you
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
know not three weeks at the end of our
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
tenure because of course we all go
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
through to the beginning of December but
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me to
 
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.630 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me to
be

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
um the wrong exercise at the wrong
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
time thank you I'll be the hopefully the
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
legislation will be drafted to be able
 
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
to share and have that information by
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
the time that we come to meet
 
00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
representative panic
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Lian my understanding
 
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
is though even though December ends this
 
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
legislative year I was
 
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.829 align:start position:0%
legislative year I was
told

00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
told
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
by certain people uh who
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
are um so with that I I think I was just
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
in jel car this morning so I think I'll
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
hop onto that continuity issue uh so on
 
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
gel car The Joint legislative committee
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
on administrative rules um the speaker
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
will need to appoint the new Jael before
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
the December Jael car meeting or else
 
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
the December Jael car meeting will not
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
be able to happen there is nothing that
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
by default carries over from term to
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
term so it will require a renaming of
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
members if this committee were to
 
00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
continue in his exact same form um with
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
the members who are continuing because I
 
00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
know representative long will well
 
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
there's a good chance that he'll be
 
00:48:53.789 --> 00:48:53.799 align:start position:0%
Senator long um by then um or citizen
 
00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:56.079 align:start position:0%
long one or the other um but he won't be
 
00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
able to be on this committee as a house
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
committee so even if we were to continue
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
on it still would require the action by
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
the speaker to do that while the speaker
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
is lining up a number of other things so
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
even if it continues there's probably
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
going to be a bit of a void before we're
 
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
to reconstitute thank you for the
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
clarification you're welcome I'm still
 
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
you and I will make one promise to you
 
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weber that if I don't
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
think that that discussion is going to
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
to get us anywhere fruitful it will not
 
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:31.720 align:start position:0%
be long it will be short and we'll make
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
sure that we are not just uh sitting
 
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
here and having mental gymnastics that
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
point and with that um would anybody
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
like to address the
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
committee you want to come up and state
 
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
your name for me and then I'll have you
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
fill out a p i I'll have you write it
 
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
down make sure that we have the spelling
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.950 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
okay um so sorry and just before you
 
00:50:15.549 --> 00:50:15.559 align:start position:0%
start there's a number of us that do
 
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
have other commitments later on so
 
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully this doesn't mean that we'll
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
be cutting anything short if we as long
 
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
as we keep it to a shorter presentation
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
that we can concentrate on I'll do my
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
best be great thank you U my name is
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
grelli Glenn I'm um I'm a mother um I am
 
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
homeless currently at the moment my
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
children were removed from me by DCF um
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
a year ago September
 
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
18th for reason because I was homeless
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
um I brought I brought my experte that
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
was you know that they give to the court
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to for for them to
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
remove the custody of my children
 
00:50:56.829 --> 00:50:56.839 align:start position:0%
and um we know that the law says that in
 
00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
order for them to remove your children
 
00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
them children must be in imminent at
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
risk or in imminent danger and
 
00:51:05.589 --> 00:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going to read you a piece of
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
a uh uh of what they submitted to the
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
court that was signed off by the judge
 
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
as reason to remove my children even
 
00:51:14.789 --> 00:51:14.799 align:start position:0%
though the law itself says that um
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
children shouldn't that they if if it's
 
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
strictly financial reasons it's not
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's not a way that they can't find
 
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
you to be neglectful if those are the
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
only um
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances so this is her she did the
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%

this year although Miss Glenn has been
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
difficult to engage since July the
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
division was very recently able to
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%

00:52:57.549 --> 00:52:57.559 align:start position:0%
Miss Glenn prior to her arrest and Miss
 
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
Glenn was again unable to identify a
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
place for her and her children to stay
 
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
thus leaving the children without
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate shelter for the evening
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
based on the foregoing there is
 
00:53:10.109 --> 00:53:10.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable cause to believe that the
 
00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:11.799 align:start position:0%
children are in circumstances or
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
surroundings that present an imminent
 
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
risk to his or her health life or life
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
that necessitate immediate out of home
 
00:53:21.069 --> 00:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
placement the children are without
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
proper parental care or control or or
 
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
necessary control for their physical
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
mental or emotional health and their
 
00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:29.799 align:start position:0%
health is very likely to suffer serious
 
00:53:32.589 --> 00:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
impairment based on the foregoing there
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
is reasonable cause to believe that the
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
continuation in the home is contrary to
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
the welfare of the above referenced
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
children expart relief is the only
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
relief available for the division now
 
00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:45.799 align:start position:0%
the part that she left out was that
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
while I was arrest when I was arrested
 
00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
my children were at school and I called
 
00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
my 24y old son to pick the children up
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
from school when my son got to my
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
youngest son School DCF was on the phone
 
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
with the school
 
00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
now they have no business and no reason
 
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
to be on the phone with my children's
 
00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
school because just because I got
 
00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
arrested parents get arrested all the
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
time and I was supposed to be presumed
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
innocent until proven guilty so why was
 
00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
she on the phone with with with the
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
school because she she thought that I
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't that no one was going to be there
 
00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
to pick up my children from school that
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
I didn't make arrangements or whatever
 
00:54:22.349 --> 00:54:22.359 align:start position:0%
the case may be she assumed that so my
 
00:54:23.789 --> 00:54:23.799 align:start position:0%
son shows up at the school she's on the
 
00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
phone she asks him what if the kids were
 
00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:27.559 align:start position:0%
going to are going to be with him for
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
the evening if they have somewhere to
 
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
stay my son has his own apartment have
 
00:54:34.109 --> 00:54:34.119 align:start position:0%
two older children one's 29 and one's 24
 
00:54:35.549 --> 00:54:35.559 align:start position:0%
they both have their own
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
Apartments um she he said yes they're
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
going to be staying with him she asked
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
for his address he reluctantly he has
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
passed because this is not my first time
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
dealing with DCF so he has his own
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
experiences with DCF now and he's an
 
00:54:49.789 --> 00:54:49.799 align:start position:0%
adult now so he reluctantly he didn't
 
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
really want to but he reluctantly gave
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
her his address and so that where the
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
children would be nonetheless right
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
within that time they were finding their
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
ex parte and then she and then she when
 
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
I called her to ask her why she was on
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
the phone with my children's school she
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
was claiming that she couldn't hear me
 
00:55:08.829 --> 00:55:08.839 align:start position:0%
and she was going to call me back and
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
when she called me back is when she gave
 
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
told me that um they F an exte and I
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
needed to I needed to hand over my
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
children now I don't hear anything that
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
I've read to y'all to you guys that is
 
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
fitting under the law of imminent danger
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh because being arrested is not is
 
00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
not they were at school so they weren't
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
there and when they were we there the
 
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
police found somewhere for us to go and
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not enough that's not
 
00:55:35.789 --> 00:55:35.799 align:start position:0%
it doesn't show imminent danger that I'm
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
going to that I didn't tell them where
 
00:55:39.789 --> 00:55:39.799 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be sleeping at I don't have
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
an obligation to tell them where I'm
 
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
where I'm going to be or where I'm
 
00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:45.160 align:start position:0%
sleeping that's none of their business
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
when when they first contacted me in
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
July I specifically said that to them
 
00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:50.839 align:start position:0%
because like I said I have experiences
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
with them I know how they get down so um
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
I I record my conversations with them um
 
00:56:01.029 --> 00:56:01.039 align:start position:0%
I let everybody know that I deal with
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
that no one's going to be able to say
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
anything about me that's not true
 
00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:05.559 align:start position:0%
because that's what I've experienced in
 
00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
the past and simply because I don't have
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
a title or I don't work for some agency
 
00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:11.720 align:start position:0%
whatever I say doesn't matter I'm not
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
believed anywhere any anywhere or
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
anytime I have not been believed
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
whatever they say the the things that
 
00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
they write in their reports that they
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
they manipulate that they turn into make
 
00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
and make it seem like the people the
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
parents are the most horrible parents in
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
the world that's not how it really is
 
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
and and the fact that we are that they
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
they are doing this under the guise of
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the children is is
 
00:56:36.359 --> 00:56:37.309 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the children is is
is

00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
outlandish because there is no way that
 
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
anybody going to tell me to my face that
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
what they have done to my children
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
removed my children from me I've not
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
seen my children since March I'm not
 
00:56:50.349 --> 00:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
barely I'm able I don't speak to my
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
seven-year-old my youngest child seveny
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
old now I don't speak with him they they
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
I'm supposed they have their own
 
00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
protocols they have all those protocols
 
00:56:59.670 --> 00:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
that they're supposed to follow that the
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
parents are supposed to be they supposed
 
00:57:02.589 --> 00:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
to honor the voice of the parents
 
00:57:03.789 --> 00:57:03.799 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be included in all
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
the decisions that are being made with
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
the children all of those things and
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
they are not doing any of those things
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
and just because I have an attitude
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they don't have to
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to inform me of
 
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
these things and it and what what what's
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
really contradictory about my case is
 
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
that she came to my hotel room 4 days
 
00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
before they filed the expart and told me
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
that they were closing my case
 
00:57:28.829 --> 00:57:28.839 align:start position:0%
that's what she said to me at my door
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
that they were closing my case not that
 
00:57:32.029 --> 00:57:32.039 align:start position:0%
not like she wrote in her report they
 
00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:33.640 align:start position:0%
were going to close my case if I
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
maintain having somewhere to stay no
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
that's not what you said because you
 
00:57:40.109 --> 00:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't how would you even do that how
 
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
would you even close the case as long as
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
I maintain somewhere to stay you would
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
still have to have the case open to
 
00:57:47.309 --> 00:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
review or whatever so uh how do you how
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
do you go from closing the closing the
 
00:57:50.829 --> 00:57:50.839 align:start position:0%
case and then four days later f the next
 
00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:53.839 align:start position:0%
part to remove my children so either all
 
00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
of these things that you wrote about me
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
in this in this after David under the
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
pains and penalties of perjury are true
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
and you didn't do your job the first
 
00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
time by coming to my hotel room and
 
00:58:05.309 --> 00:58:05.319 align:start position:0%
closing my case or you didn't do your
 
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
job the second time by helping me and
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
assisting me with whatever you're
 
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to do besides removing my
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
children I asked them very clearly how
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
are you going to help me I'm homeless
 
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
that's the problem that's the reports
 
00:58:17.309 --> 00:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
you got right you got reports of
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
homelessness so how are you going to
 
00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:21.799 align:start position:0%
assist me do you have a shelter for us
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
do you have an apartment for us do you
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
have some money for us what resources do
 
00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
you have are you going to put me on some
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
list I said all of those things to her
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
on the phone in
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
July she had nothing to
 
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
offer there was a police uh um I have a
 
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
letter from the chief of police from
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
Greenland who who wrote who wrote a
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
letter stating that she when uh because
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
I had a dealing with another shelter
 
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
because I got there late they wouldn't
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
accept me it was like an hour and a half
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
away so they wouldn't accept me and my
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
children so I had to again I'm on
 
00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
survival mode here how what else am I
 
00:58:57.029 --> 00:58:57.039 align:start position:0%
supposed to do so I get a little hyped
 
00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.039 align:start position:0%
up these people are doing things they're
 
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
not supposed to do and obviously here
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
comes the police but we were in her at
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
her station all day long called every
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
possible every place possible she called
 
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
DCF DCF supposed to help people with the
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
you know with these situations so so we
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
so people think and they told her there
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
was nothing that she could do for me she
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
spoke directly to Elizabeth Berney
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that they can do for me
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
so why are you involved then you know
 
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
what my situation is City Welfare the
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
the you went you signed on and said that
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
you made reasonable efforts because in
 
00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:33.640 align:start position:0%
order to remove your children you got to
 
00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
make reasonable efforts and you little
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
check mark and said you made reasonable
 
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
efforts to prevent the removal of my
 
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
children what were those reasonable
 
00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
efforts that you made till this day I
 
00:59:45.789 --> 00:59:45.799 align:start position:0%
have not gotten any answers of that they
 
00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:47.720 align:start position:0%
consider calling City welfare and
 
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
finding out all my business and how much
 
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
money I got how much money I make and
 
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
this and that reasonable effort that's
 
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
what they consider to be reasonable
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
effort to prevent the remov of my
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
children and the last thing I want um
 
01:00:04.109 --> 01:00:04.119 align:start position:0%
another thing is I I wanted to say is uh
 
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
since being in my in in since my
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
children being in in custody my
 
01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
14-year-old son has reactive attachment
 
01:00:10.119 --> 01:00:10.910 align:start position:0%
14-year-old son has reactive attachment
dis

01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
dis
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
water now what that is is the fear of
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
being left being abandoned always being
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
on edge wondering
 
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
anxious and this happening is
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
like because at the point when they took
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
my when they took my children we had we
 
01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
had worked really hard my son got
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
suspended you know periodically from
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
school and he had to go self-contained
 
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
classrooms and all the whatever we work
 
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
but I advocated for my son all the way
 
01:00:38.029 --> 01:00:38.039 align:start position:0%
through and we had gotten to right
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
before DCF interrupted Our Lives to
 
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
where the best we were at the best point
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
he had ever been the school like you
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
know he everybody was proud of him he
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
had come such a long way and we had
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
worked so hard to get him to that point
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
and then DCF comes and takes my child
 
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
and he gets suspended 15 times from
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
school just last year alone after they
 
01:00:58.680 --> 01:00:59.470 align:start position:0%
school just last year alone after they
took

01:00:59.470 --> 01:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
took
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
him he hasn't been suspended 15 times in
 
01:01:05.789 --> 01:01:05.799 align:start position:0%
his whole life never mind in a year so
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
all the work that we did all those years
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
that I worked and that we worked hard to
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
get him to the point that we where he
 
01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
was and they they undid all of that and
 
01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
caused more damage on top of that and
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
that's not okay because this is supposed
 
01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:21.160 align:start position:0%
to be in the best interest of my
 
01:01:23.309 --> 01:01:23.319 align:start position:0%
children and now my son is being
 
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
Warehouse like that article from the
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
Associated Press there because he was in
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
a foster home with his brother and um
 
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
the foster home didn't feel like they
 
01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.039 align:start position:0%
wanted him there anymore because they
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
thought that he was going to act out or
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
whatever so they sent my son to the
 
01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
hospital in an ambulance by himself 14
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
years old to have a psychological
 
01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:44.559 align:start position:0%
evaluation he gets to the hospital has
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
the whatever he's there for 24 hours by
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
himself I have Tex from him going back
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
and forth to the clinician who you know
 
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
okayed him going there um asking when
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
what you know when when can I go I'm
 
01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
sorry blah blah blah whatever whatever
 
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
14 years old by himself over 24 hours if
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
I would have sent my son to the hospital
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
in an ambulance by himself at 14 years
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
old what do you think DCF would have
 
01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
done so why is it okay for them to do
 
01:02:14.349 --> 01:02:14.359 align:start position:0%
these things and get away with it like
 
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's all right I have a recording right
 
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
here of my that my son recorded that my
 
01:02:20.589 --> 01:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
son recorded because he knows how I how
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
I am he knows what I do in the way that
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
I am I've been like this because this
 
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
has been my life experience
 
01:02:28.589 --> 01:02:28.599 align:start position:0%
and he recorded on his own and the
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
supervisor of DCF on this recording
 
01:02:34.109 --> 01:02:34.119 align:start position:0%
tells my son that they don't want him
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
because the Foster person that where my
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
youngest son was where they were
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
together she didn't want to keep him no
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
more that's why they sent him to the
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
hospital to have the
 
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
evaluation and she tells him we don't
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
have anywhere to put you we don't have
 
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
he has two older brothers who have their
 
01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
own apartment we don't have anywhere to
 
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
put you and and they don't want you she
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
says and they don't want you and it's
 
01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
right here on the recording so you guys
 
01:02:56.829 --> 01:02:56.839 align:start position:0%
can get DCF Strat of the story and you
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
guys can get charges for being illegally
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
reported but as far as I'm concerned
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
when these people are in the official
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
capacity of their duties these are their
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
state actors these are State people
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
working on in an official capacity and
 
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
and when it's and what's at stake here
 
01:03:15.549 --> 01:03:15.559 align:start position:0%
is children's best actual best interest
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
Miss Glenn yes I am so sorry for you and
 
01:03:20.269 --> 01:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
your children for the experience that
 
01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
you've gone through in this this sounds
 
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
like it's been incredibly difficult for
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
you especially for your son who was
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
building working on building his
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
relationships and you know personally I
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
I I wasn't part of any of that but I'm
 
01:03:34.029 --> 01:03:34.039 align:start position:0%
really really sorry that this all
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
happened to you um looking at it and
 
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand from us I I
 
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
understand why you have a mistrust um it
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
seems like it developed over time and
 
01:03:48.029 --> 01:03:48.039 align:start position:0%
didn't want to tell them where you where
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
you were were and where where you were
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
going to be keeping your children um I'm
 
01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
going to go ahead and assume that you
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
had a nice warm place with the roof over
 
01:03:58.589 --> 01:03:58.599 align:start position:0%
it it was dry but because even if I did
 
01:03:59.950 --> 01:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
it my children always did because their
 
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
brothers you know submitted affidavit to
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
say that yes and um so with all all that
 
01:04:08.109 --> 01:04:08.119 align:start position:0%
but it's looking at it too you can see
 
01:04:10.029 --> 01:04:10.039 align:start position:0%
how maybe one of them didn't understand
 
01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
that and didn't see that but I'm not
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
trying to get back into that my big
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
question is do you know about DCF
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
constituent relations I absolutely do I
 
01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
know about child advocacy I know about
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
the busman I know about all of those
 
01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
people and none of them have been
 
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
helpful for me have you given them a
 
01:04:26.589 --> 01:04:26.599 align:start position:0%
rundown of where you believe that they
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
didn't follow your policies I've given
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
them a right yes numerous times I've
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
spoken for with um KRON at the child
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
advocacy more than one time I spoken
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
with Jennifer I think her name is at the
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
constituent more than one time they they
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
they listen to me on the phone for over
 
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
an hour each of them each time that I
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
spoke to them and they were really
 
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
concerned this is this was their concern
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
for me their concern is that my parental
 
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
rights are going to be terminated
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
because I refuse to comply with dcyf
 
01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:56.119 align:start position:0%
because that's where I'm at I'm not
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
complying with anything that they want
 
01:04:59.390 --> 01:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
me to do I'm not submitting to anything
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
that they want me to do because they
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
should not have my children to begin
 
01:05:05.309 --> 01:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
with now as I I have had yes dealings
 
01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
with with DCS in past my rights were
 
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
terminated to three of my children 16
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
years ago 16 years ago because I didn't
 
01:05:15.549 --> 01:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
have suitable housing my rights were
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
terminated because I didn't have
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
suitable housing 16 years
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
ago there's a lot of people who don't
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
have suitable hous there's a lot of
 
01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
homeless people out there we're going to
 
01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
start taking people's children because
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
they don't have they don't have an
 
01:05:29.309 --> 01:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
apartment at the time or a certain place
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
to live with their children not
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
everybody has the means to be able to to
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
live in a luxurious big five-bedroom
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
house you know what I mean but I always
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
always did the best of my kids were
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
always loved and and knew you know knew
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
knew who their mom was and that I did
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
the best that I could at the time with
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
what I had every time so and can I ask
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
another question to you have your adult
 
01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
sons who have Apartments um if if I'm
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
not going to ask you whether or not they
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
wanted your son to be in there because
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
that's not my business and it's not
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
something that I want to ask and put out
 
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
there on the Internet or anything like
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
that with the recordings what I want to
 
01:06:11.269 --> 01:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
ask is if DCF was helpful if the request
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
was made for them to have a kinship
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
guard kinship care for them to be placed
 
01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
with those those brothers that was that
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
was actually done with my oldest 29y old
 
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
um they did the home study for to have
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
my children go with them and they were
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
they found they did not approve for them
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
to go with my 29-year-old son whom I
 
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
raised by the way with me never was in
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
foster care or none of that he was only
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
his whole life um because because he
 
01:06:40.349 --> 01:06:40.359 align:start position:0%
they didn't feel that he could set
 
01:06:40.359 --> 01:06:41.829 align:start position:0%
they didn't feel that he could set
appropriate

01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
boundaries with me meaning meaning not
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
have allow me around the children or
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
whatever said appropriate they didn't
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
think that he could set appropriate
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
boundaries so and boundaries against me
 
01:06:57.069 --> 01:06:57.079 align:start position:0%
the boundaries were as as a followup I
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
find it concerning that if the removal
 
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:01.640 align:start position:0%
was for not having suitable housing that
 
01:07:04.109 --> 01:07:04.119 align:start position:0%
that if that is the reason for the expar
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
that they're not letting you speak with
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
I with this um I definitely would be
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
interested in talking with you more
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
about this it seems like you've tried to
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
go through some of these processes and
 
01:07:20.589 --> 01:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
tried to talk to the right people but
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
you've ended up with dead ends yes I've
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
done I've done a lot a lot of that and
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
and I want to point out also that the
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
main the main reason I believe that this
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
was this is um happened was because what
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
like the the situation with City Welfare
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester City Welfare is that I was I
 
01:07:39.269 --> 01:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
was um I was I was bringing making a lot
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
of noise I was speaking at the uh
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
mayor's meetings as mayor Al men public
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
meetings I was um I was I was putting it
 
01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
online all of this because they are
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
because even right now they they're
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
charging people who are in the financial
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
hardship for shelter reimbursement in
 
01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
the law RSA 16520 B says that they can
 
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed after they have assisted
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
you not during not while not in the
 
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
meantime after they've assisted you they
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
can they can you know request shelter
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursement unless it places you in a
 
01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
financial hardship now who is in a
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
homeless shelter and not considered to
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
be in a financial
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
hardship so she was telling me to my
 
01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
face that I was not in a financial
 
01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
hardship the lady I said Heather Moran
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
the one that called on me
 
01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
and I didn't know how to like I couldn't
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
understand why that was hard to respond
 
01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
to yes because I'm like yes like what
 
01:08:36.030 --> 01:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
and I get crazy I apologize for
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
representative love having to leave for
 
01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
his other meeting I think we may have
 
01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
some other people that are having the
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
same I don't know if anybody else had
 
01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:44.030 align:start position:0%
same I don't know if anybody else had
any

01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
questions um yeah so so that was that
 
01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:49.719 align:start position:0%
that was the main reason behind even her
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
even her suspending me for the 14 days
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
she's saying that I couldn't account for
 
01:08:56.110 --> 01:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
$1,300 she had the email email in her in
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
her email sitting me accounting for the
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
$1,300 that she was talking about so she
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
didn't have to suspend me but she did
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
anyways and she and the and the sick
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
part is is that they had an empty room
 
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
because they contract four of the rooms
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
from family transition they contract
 
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
four of those rooms and they had an
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
empty room and she was denying me and my
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
children's shelter because I couldn't
 
01:09:19.309 --> 01:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
account for $1,300 that was sitting in
 
01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:20.309 align:start position:0%
account for $1,300 that was sitting in
her

01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
email so that's why you know she called
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
insisted and called again like
 
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
oh she just got arrested oh she like
 
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
what like what what are you reporting DC
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
of my my life for like that's none of
 
01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
the business you know what I mean so
 
01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
that's that's why I believe even more so
 
01:09:38.349 --> 01:09:38.359 align:start position:0%
you know that this this this happened to
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
me not necessarily because I was being
 
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
neglectful because I was not being
 
01:09:43.829 --> 01:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
neglectful I was doing I was doing
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
whatever I could for my children and the
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
police told me that I could sleep in my
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
car so if if it's not against the law
 
01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
for the and the police told me that I
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
could sleep in my car then what is the
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
problem here it was warm outside it was
 
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
summertime if I pitched my Somewhere
 
01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
That's My Prerogative as their
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
mother but the courts doesn't seem to
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
think so that I got to tell them my
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
business where I'm going to be sleeping
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise you remove my children from
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
me this none of this none of this is
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
okay none of this makes sense and and
 
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
what I know is that they do this to
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
people on a daily basis and that's why
 
01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
I'm more I'm more willing and I know
 
01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
it's at risk I know it's at risk here
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's already happened to me but
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to to I'm willing to take
 
01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
that sa make that sacrifice if it's
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
going to if it's going to stop these
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
people from doing what they're doing to
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
Al to my people because there's people
 
01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
from my community that's going through
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
this it's people from from my life's
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
experiences that are going through this
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
and I have no resolve and I have no
 
01:10:44.189 --> 01:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
Solutions and just get and then these
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
people just continue to lie on them on
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
us and get away with it so I'm willing
 
01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
to do that like like I know I don't
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
think there's really many people out
 
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
there that would be willing to do that I
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
don't I I can't think of any that's how
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
far I'm willing to go like Isaac brought
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
his son up to the mountain I'm willing
 
01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
to just just to not comply just to show
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
how how how what it is that's going on
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
here because like I said it's bigger
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
than me and my children this is bigger
 
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
than me and my children because as I
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
said 16 years ago they terminated my
 
01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
parental rights at that time I did have
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
substance abuse issues I went to prison
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
I got clean I was clean for 5 years I
 
01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
remained clean not once testing dirty
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
having random drug screens for 5 years
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
when I had my trial to for my children I
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
was not even the same person anymore I
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
did everything that they wanted me to do
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
I complied with everything and I even
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
put some more stuff on my own that I was
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
not required just to go above and beyond
 
01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
to prove that I deserved my own children
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
just to lose so if I'm going to lose
 
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
this time I'm going to lose at my terms
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
not at their terms by complying and
 
01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.430 align:start position:0%
not at their terms by complying and
losing

01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
losing
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
anyways because now my children are
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
grown they're 19 20 and 21 years old
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
and and and they didn't have didn't have
 
01:11:59.430 --> 01:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
me and and I just recently got in
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
contact with one with my daughters and
 
01:12:04.629 --> 01:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
and just this past weekend my my
 
01:12:07.149 --> 01:12:07.159 align:start position:0%
29-year-old oldest son and my
 
01:12:09.229 --> 01:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
20-year-old daughter reunited for the
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
first time since since they were taken
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
over 16 years ago 16 years ago when my
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
rights were terminated it was over when
 
01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
she was four years old she's 20 now she
 
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't even remember him and the same
 
01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
thing with my mom and these are the
 
01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
things that people don't when when they
 
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
take our children and terminate our
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
rights and do that that they those
 
01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
things are not even considered they're
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
not even thought about what the the the
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
harm and the that the the the trauma and
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
the Damage that you caus these children
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
lifelong thinking that whatever you know
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
whatever was in their reports that I did
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
this that I left them alone to go party
 
01:12:42.629 --> 01:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
that I that I didn't take care of them
 
01:12:44.669 --> 01:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
things that were not factual that are
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
not true and I believe that they have
 
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
come back in my life right now at the
 
01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
worst point that I could possibly be in
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
my life to see this play out because I'm
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
not even going to have to explain to
 
01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
them or show to them or prove to them
 
01:12:58.270 --> 01:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
that I did everything that I possibly
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
could to get them back and I
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
lost and they're going to see that
 
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to see all of this play
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
out because my my daughter watches most
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
of the most of the stuff that I put out
 
01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
and and the things that I that I do the
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
speaking and that I do podcasts that
 
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
I've been on because I've been speaking
 
01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
about this non-stop Non-Stop and the
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
thing is is that what keeps me going are
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
the people that I don't even know that
 
01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
send me messages in my inbox and and
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
encourage me and say yeah this happened
 
01:13:25.149 --> 01:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
to me too like it's it's it's mind
 
01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
boggling the amount of people that I've
 
01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
come across just by that telling me same
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
like different similar stories some
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
worse some some the same some not as bad
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
nonetheless same stories I have a um so
 
01:13:41.229 --> 01:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
miss GL yes you are an amazing Fighter
 
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
for your kids but the strongest thing
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
that stands out to me right here your
 
01:13:47.629 --> 01:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
relationship with your adult
 
01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
kids that that shows me how much you
 
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
care it shows me a lot of pure heart um
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
with what we are working with and trying
 
01:13:59.709 --> 01:13:59.719 align:start position:0%
to understand I I think one of the
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
things that we need to make sure is that
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
the reports to constituent relations are
 
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
processed in a way where they can see if
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
they're hearing these reports from you
 
01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
and from other parents about where
 
01:14:10.629 --> 01:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
they're not following policies we need
 
01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
to find out where that goes and how it's
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
processed and how it's handled because
 
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
if that just sort of comes into an inbox
 
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
and and nothing really gets reviewed
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
once and nothing much happens that
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't help to protect other families
 
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
or the same families when they come back
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
so that's one of those things that I
 
01:14:29.229 --> 01:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
will look into before next week um I do
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
know rep representative Weber had had to
 
01:14:34.629 --> 01:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
leave for another meeting um and I'm not
 
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
sure how many more of us um with that
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
I quite frankly my empathy and
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
compassion for everything that's already
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
happened to you I already have the
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
things that I need to focus on with that
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to listen to more but I
 
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
think that right now I see moving
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
forward trying to make sure that we get
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
those reports is probably the most
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
important thing to keep this from
 
01:14:58.590 --> 01:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
happening from other families that's
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
that's my um ultimate
 
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately ultimately what I'm hoping
 
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
for is that we see that because the fact
 
01:15:11.229 --> 01:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
of the matter is that DCF receives money
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
different from from the Social Security
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
from title
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
4E and was 42e 4E 42 one of those um and
 
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
they receive
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
incentives all kinds of incentives you
 
01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
could possib any you could possibly
 
01:15:28.629 --> 01:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
think of they get paid for so they have
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
incentives for removing people's
 
01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
children they don't have incentives for
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
keeping the children at home or for
 
01:15:35.629 --> 01:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
finding the resources because all they
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
would have had to done is help me with
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
some housing not remove my children
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's not in their best interest and
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's the part that like we're
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
operating under what's in the best
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
interest of the children and in most
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
cases that I have heard experienc or
 
01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
been that's been shared with me nothing
 
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
has been in their best interest 29 kids
 
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
died at their hands who were taken from
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
their parents for their best interest
 
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
and they ended up dying in DCF custody
 
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
20 24 and 29 the year before that and
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
having a parent who will fight for you
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
is one of those things that's pretty
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
strong informational for a child to know
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
that their parent cares enough to fight
 
01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
for them um so thank you for fighting
 
01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
for your kids I know as we move forward
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
with this I don't know how else what
 
01:16:18.629 --> 01:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
else you know I mean I don't know how
 
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
not to do that well there's parents who
 
01:16:22.030 --> 01:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't there's parents who don't fight
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
for their kids so that makes you really
 
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
really special that you do even with
 
01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
everything that you've gone through so
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um I just wanted to
 
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you're aware you're
 
01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
probably aware but there is also a a
 
01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
children's Bill of Rights you know that
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be presented at a
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
certain age that they have to follow for
 
01:16:39.149 --> 01:16:39.159 align:start position:0%
the children's Bill of Rights while
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
they're in foster care which includes
 
01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
parent visits with friend with parents
 
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
includes that the parents be involved in
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
all the you know anything the decisions
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
that are being made about them blah they
 
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
blah ongoing and obviously that's not
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
being followed either
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
um and um and I just also I just wanted
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
to reference I don't know if you have if
 
01:16:59.950 --> 01:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
anyone has told you all about the the
 
01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
recent report that ACLU released it's
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
called if I wasn't poor I wouldn't be
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
unfit and like that that shows the
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
numbers you know the the statistics the
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
all of the the um disproportionate it's
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
pretty much disproportionate for us as
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
it is for people that go to prison you
 
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
know black minorities and lowincome
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
social economic scale um so it's like
 
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
140 or 64 page report this
 
01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
so this not it's not like it's just a
 
01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
new Hamp this is like across the country
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
but just to to has a lot of information
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
in there that could be useful that you
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
will see that these things are are
 
01:17:37.149 --> 01:17:37.159 align:start position:0%
really happening in is that more recent
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
than the last six months I believe it's
 
01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
within the last six months this is when
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
I came across it because um I believe I
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
distributed one um or at least the link
 
01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
to it with everybody um with one of
 
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
those talking about the dis
 
01:17:50.629 --> 01:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
disproportionate impact on that yeah it
 
01:17:52.629 --> 01:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
was was it called um if I wasn't poor I
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be unfit um it rings a bell um
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
that may be one and so I will look to
 
01:17:59.229 --> 01:17:59.239 align:start position:0%
that because that is that is one of the
 
01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
issues um just to make sure that make
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
sure that people aren't mixing the
 
01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
different issues together right right
 
01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
and that's why you took my children for
 
01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
being homeless and now you want to add
 
01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
stipulations and uh um want me to submit
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
to drug test want me to have therapy I
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
already do therapy on my own but you
 
01:18:16.629 --> 01:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
don't have to tell me to do therapy
 
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
based on what based on my history now
 
01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
you want to use my history again me I've
 
01:18:21.629 --> 01:18:21.639 align:start position:0%
been clean since 2016 when I got on
 
01:18:23.229 --> 01:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
methodone and I got off methodone in
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
2017 and I've been in recovery ever
 
01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
since and you want to bring up my past
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
and you want to use this when this has
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with any of that that
 
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
those are the kinds of things that they
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
parents so one of the things that you
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
would like to see is to see in the
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
policy is that somebody who's resolved
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
their past they're not using that
 
01:18:47.629 --> 01:18:47.639 align:start position:0%
against them I do know that I've loved
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
ones that have had heroin issues and
 
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
there's always that Rel relapse
 
01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity right so obviously there's
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
some to that too just because but just
 
01:18:58.030 --> 01:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
because someone uses drugs doesn't make
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
them a bad parent that's where the
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
resources need to come in and they
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
actually need to address the issue and
 
01:19:04.830 --> 01:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
not make the issue more make it more
 
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
trauma make it harder on the people
 
01:19:08.229 --> 01:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
because like you said some parents don't
 
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
fight some parents don't have enough of
 
01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
that fight left in them once you remove
 
01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
their children they they've lost all
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
their hope you know what I mean because
 
01:19:16.629 --> 01:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
they know fighting a system like this
 
01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
there's really no hope yes you know what
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
I mean yes um so I think that that
 
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
looking to making sure that somebody's
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
pass that they've moved they've built
 
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
themselves up from moved on from and
 
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
moved past and probably become a
 
01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
stronger person because of um that
 
01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
that's not something that's separating
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
somebody from their family because a
 
01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
role model who can uh break an addiction
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
like that and stay clean especially when
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
facing challenges right right that's a
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
role model it's and and it's not always
 
01:19:46.669 --> 01:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
the easiest thing to do either you know
 
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
and the things like this the stressors
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
that they add on to to my if I if I were
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
not if I were not so grounded in my
 
01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
faith number one my faith in God because
 
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
that's the only really the thing that
 
01:19:58.629 --> 01:19:58.639 align:start position:0%
keeps me going having hope is because I
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
know that I know God is behind me and
 
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
forness of that and obviously you know
 
01:20:05.229 --> 01:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
the length of time that I've had yeah
 
01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
the enemy would still try like to have
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
one think like just go just go out and
 
01:20:10.990 --> 01:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
get and get messed up I dealing with
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
something like this yeah absolutely but
 
01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:15.560 align:start position:0%
thank God pray that I'm that I was not
 
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
you know I mean that I did not fall
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
victim to that and that I would did not
 
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
end up that didn't not end up happening
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
to me but it could have very well
 
01:20:24.430 --> 01:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
happened you know what I mean and it
 
01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
would been unnecessary and it would have
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
been uncalled for and all that just as
 
01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
as a result of these agencies getting
 
01:20:32.350 --> 01:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
away and operating however they want
 
01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:33.719 align:start position:0%
because that's basically what they're
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
doing so the last thing I just wanted to
 
01:20:37.629 --> 01:20:37.639 align:start position:0%
play is just a couple of minutes of the
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
of the of my son no I'm sorry that that
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
one if we get to you recording something
 
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
where then it's not recorded my son
 
01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
recorded he's 14 years old he recorded
 
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
dcyf supervisor telling him that they
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
don't want him this is plenty relevant
 
01:20:53.229 --> 01:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
and this is what happens in the in these
 
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
cases and you know why you guys don't
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
believe that's why they don't believe
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
them even having evidence like this
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
seeing people don't want to hear it they
 
01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
want to turn their face to it or their
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
ears to it and not and not actually
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that these things are happen
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
son what I'm trying to do isn't to bury
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
this or anything like that once you're
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
getting into the fact that he recorded
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
it as one party not AUD not you um and I
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
turned off your mic so you can turn it
 
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
back on um I just don't want you to get
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
into a situation I don't care I'm
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
willing to sacrifice anything that I got
 
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
to sacrifice but go to jail get arrested
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
I don't care as long as the people are
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
held responsible for what the part that
 
01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
they play and and they're held
 
01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
accountable too I'm not the only ones
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
that should be held that should be uh
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
the law should be enforced on they have
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
to follow the law too they have to
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
follow things too and they're not so I'm
 
01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
willing to do whatever I got to do like
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
I said I I don't really it don't matter
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
much to me I just want what's supposed
 
01:21:55.149 --> 01:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
to happen to be
 
01:22:28.270 --> 01:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:31.550 align:start position:0%
 
thank

01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
you and um I did give Miss Glenn a lot
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
more time because we've seen you before
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to make sure that she had a
 
01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
chance to share with us what was going
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
on I am going to ask you to keep it more
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
limited because I we're going to lose
 
01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:48.639 align:start position:0%
even more people to our next commitments
 
01:22:51.229 --> 01:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for that um I wasn't
 
01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
sure that people were going to come and
 
01:22:54.189 --> 01:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
when we first started off and started
 
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
talking about that we just had
 
01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
representative kushman we didn't have
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
you here so I wasn't able to manage our
 
01:23:01.709 --> 01:23:01.719 align:start position:0%
schedule in order to accommodate that so
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
I'll keep you brief sir and give us your
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
name again hello my name is Donald
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
Gilbert um so yeah so yes I'm definitely
 
01:23:13.950 --> 01:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
keep it uh brief here um one thing that
 
01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
I do want to point out is I was not
 
01:23:17.149 --> 01:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
informed about this until 10 o'clock
 
01:23:19.629 --> 01:23:19.639 align:start position:0%
last night so I don't know if it made it
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
on the calendar before yesterday but
 
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
somebody informed me yesterday and it
 
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
seems that that notification went on
 
01:23:29.229 --> 01:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
about 5:00 yesterday um so with that the
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
it went on the house calendar which went
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
out a week ago there was a notification
 
01:23:36.669 --> 01:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
sent out um there's not there's no way
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
to the technology requirements to have
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
anybody interested we know about a
 
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
calendar notice before the calendar just
 
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
would be too much to do but it was in
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
the house calendar understandable yeah
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
so just on the actual House website
 
01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
where it lists everything it was not on
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
there it might have been in like the one
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
that gets sent out to all of the house
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't on the published you know
 
01:23:59.870 --> 01:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
this body's meeting on this day this day
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
um I think with that you may have been
 
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the house meeting schedule
 
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
which is supposed to be done as a
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
convenience to everybody the official
 
01:24:08.189 --> 01:24:08.199 align:start position:0%
record is the calendar the one that's
 
01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
been published um since long before I
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
was born um I've also run into the same
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
challenge of just technology not having
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
it on the house meeting schedule so sure
 
01:24:18.510 --> 01:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
especially when you're looking for this
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
just if you're on Twitter or X I'm
 
01:24:24.149 --> 01:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
dating myself if you're on X sign up to
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire um the house clerk
 
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
okay because the house clerk will
 
01:24:29.629 --> 01:24:29.639 align:start position:0%
publish the new calendar link every time
 
01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:31.400 align:start position:0%
it's out with a shortened one so that
 
01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
you can do that and check and look and
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
see if the Committees that you're
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
interested in our meeting sure thing so
 
01:24:38.189 --> 01:24:38.199 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make this probably a little
 
01:24:40.030 --> 01:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
bit of Rapid Fire here we're going to
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
touch back on what Giselle just
 
01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
testified about and indicate that so you
 
01:24:49.950 --> 01:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
heard earlier this year about some of
 
01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
the background of myself and
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
whatnot it wasn't till that that mother
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
was going to be homeless that they took
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
the children from the
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
home down in Manchester for my
 
01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.390 align:start position:0%
home down in Manchester for my
children's

01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
children's
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
siblings again just to recap DCF was
 
01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
having the children in the home for two
 
01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
years in violation of criminal bail
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
conditions for seven counts of child
 
01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
pornography and in violation of 169c
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
protective orders that were specific to
 
01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
that that individual specific to those
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
children and the court was upholding no
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
contact orders DCF refused to follow
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
those no contact
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
orders we don't know it'd be nice for
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
DCF to let people know but it's clear um
 
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
so may if I since you're going to be
 
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
rapid fire I'm going to interrupt you to
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
ask questions did you report that
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
through the constituent relations and
 
01:25:51.149 --> 01:25:51.159 align:start position:0%
the others when they were in violation
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
of that so just yeah I guess we can
 
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
recap there I have regular
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
Communications with the new director uh
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
Marine unim I have regular connections
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
with the uh constituent relations
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
supervisor uh and obviously the ab
 
01:26:08.109 --> 01:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
budsman office and the office of the
 
01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
child advocate and we collaboratively
 
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
approach different things but um as
 
01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
you'll hear here later on the office of
 
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
the child advocate and some of these
 
01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
even the internal Administration is
 
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
getting shut down from the local office
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
administration as to what's going on at
 
01:26:30.669 --> 01:26:30.679 align:start position:0%
the local
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
offices um but that's something
 
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
unrelated to this I'm the reason I'm
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
asking is because if this may this may
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
be one of those areas I know we've seen
 
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
some of it before but we didn't we
 
01:26:44.910 --> 01:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
weren't necessarily asking if people
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
were reporting it through those
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
processes throughout yes so yeah so I
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
mean just myself included you know
 
01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
obviously I've seen it with that
 
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
situation with my own children's
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
siblings with what Griselle has gone
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
through um you know I think it's
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
horrific that we're going to go ahead
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
and leave the children in the home you
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
know with all of that going on but now
 
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
that they're facing homelessness oh
 
01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
that's when we go ahead oop sorry that's
 
01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:16.719 align:start position:0%
when we go ahead and remove the children
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
that you know a little disheartening
 
01:27:22.590 --> 01:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
there um and I know of several other
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
cases where the children have been
 
01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
removed because the parents were
 
01:27:29.229 --> 01:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
homeless um up in the Lakes Region um I
 
01:27:32.189 --> 01:27:32.199 align:start position:0%
deal with I'm at Isaiah's calf quite
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
frequently um and engage with a lot of
 
01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
the and again I understand a lot of the
 
01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
individuals do have substance abuse
 
01:27:42.189 --> 01:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
backgrounds but the rebuttal of
 
01:27:45.149 --> 01:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
presumption of harm was
 
01:27:48.669 --> 01:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
uh repealed at the time over that it
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
just went it just barely went back into
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
effect you know just in the last couple
 
01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
of months or so so under the rebuttable
 
01:27:59.830 --> 01:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
presumption of harm that wasn't there
 
01:28:01.950 --> 01:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
before so you can't use somebody's drug
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
addiction against them you can't use
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
somebody's homelessness against them if
 
01:28:08.669 --> 01:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
the child's living in a tent as long as
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
they are psychologically in physically
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
well you're they're entitled to be in
 
01:28:16.830 --> 01:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
that tent you know unfortunately you
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
know that's what the law is I mean
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough for the parents but you
 
01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
know as the parents are actually caring
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
for and if the schools are not reporting
 
01:28:27.310 --> 01:28:27.320 align:start position:0%
neglect or abuse and medical providers
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
are not reporting NE neglect and abuse
 
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
and things are being taken care of
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to take that child
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
from that tent it doesn't matter I mean
 
01:28:36.669 --> 01:28:36.679 align:start position:0%
they could be on the the street corner
 
01:28:38.189 --> 01:28:38.199 align:start position:0%
you know you're supposed to be supplying
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
them with the services the services are
 
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
there the money is there Supply the
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
services we won't get into you know all
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
of that moving on though from that one
 
01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
of the big issues right now that I think
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
everywhere is seeing it was brought
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
forth to the oversight Commission
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
on children services last month which
 
01:28:59.189 --> 01:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
obviously meets again
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and Office of the child
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
advocate testified indicating that DCF
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
has been hiding records and forging
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
records to the office of the child
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
advocate and the Attorney General's
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
office um and you can obviously speak to
 
01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
any of those members or OCA and get that
 
01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
testimony from them directly um I know
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
case specific
 
01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
I have a supervisor who's no longer a
 
01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
supervisor that went ahead and gave me
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
an email documentation certifying that
 
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
Administration within dcyf was
 
01:29:39.709 --> 01:29:39.719 align:start position:0%
requesting the local office to not
 
01:29:43.109 --> 01:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
record documents and to not record
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
interactions at least for my specific
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
case I don't know how much and the
 
01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:53.639 align:start position:0%
timeline on that is kind of impeccable
 
01:29:58.270 --> 01:29:58.280 align:start position:0%
if you go back to right about uh I think
 
01:29:59.669 --> 01:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
it was like I don't remember what time
 
01:30:02.189 --> 01:30:02.199 align:start position:0%
in July but there was a lawsuit that was
 
01:30:06.669 --> 01:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
filed against the state and the governor
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
and in August it was before the
 
01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
legislative performance audit committee
 
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
it was brought up in there where they
 
01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
decided that they were not going to
 
01:30:19.109 --> 01:30:19.119 align:start position:0%
continue to investigate or bring forth
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
subpoenas against some of these things
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
because the fa these specific topics
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
are there's a federal lawsuit pending
 
01:30:29.229 --> 01:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
against the governor and the state for
 
01:30:29.239 --> 01:30:30.189 align:start position:0%
against the governor and the state for
these

01:30:30.189 --> 01:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
issues um so it kind of Falls in line of
 
01:30:36.910 --> 01:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
everybody shutting down at this point
 
01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
and refusing to I have not had any
 
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
engagement with my cpsw since
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
July so because they refuse to engage um
 
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
in a way that can be recorded and
 
01:30:52.109 --> 01:30:52.119 align:start position:0%
documented um we don't know if that's
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
Direction it assuming that it's not
 
01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
direction from the Attorney General's
 
01:30:57.109 --> 01:30:57.119 align:start position:0%
office but obviously the Attorney
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
General's office is the one that has to
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
represent the state in defending this
 
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
lawsuit as well so it's a very hard
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
predicament for the Attorney General's
 
01:31:08.109 --> 01:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
office to criminally investigate the
 
01:31:10.510 --> 01:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
department while also defending the
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
department from these Federal
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuits you know something has to give
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
and change here so that the transparency
 
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
can open up and things can be held
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
accountable so that we we're not just
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
covering it
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
up um I I don't know exactly how we do
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
that but you know some members have
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
indicated one way is to get the division
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
out from underneath the scope of thhs
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
and have them assign their own defending
 
01:31:42.109 --> 01:31:42.119 align:start position:0%
attorneys and whatnot and have a
 
01:31:45.629 --> 01:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
complete beer you know Departments of
 
01:31:45.639 --> 01:31:46.629 align:start position:0%
complete beer you know Departments of
children

01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
services focusing on children's services
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
providing and upholding their policies
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
and their laws that's one of the biggest
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
things is the policies and laws are in
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
place they don't follow them you know
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
you know so again trying to keep it less
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
case specific but case specific my child
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
is in an unlicensed foster home
 
01:32:13.149 --> 01:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
currently and so they've indicated well
 
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
they've permitted the foster home it
 
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
took nine months for them to permit this
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
foster home well if you look at the
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
definition of permit under HC uh HC 644
 
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
six the definition is means of temporary
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
authorization to operate a family foster
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
home uh sorry foster home yeah as
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
defined as RSA
 
01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:39.270 align:start position:0%
defined as RSA
170e

01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
170e
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
252a for a period not to exceed 6 months
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
well if you go to 170 uh e
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
252a that's for licensing Child Care
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
institutions of caring for 12 or more
 
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
children there is no permitting process
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
to individually license a single-body
 
01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
person and they're not following their
 
01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:02.870 align:start position:0%
person and they're not following their
own

01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:33:05.310 --> 01:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
things did you have a question um with
 
01:33:07.629 --> 01:33:07.639 align:start position:0%
that there is certain Foster Family
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
approval there may be some difference in
 
01:33:12.109 --> 01:33:12.119 align:start position:0%
how the language is there I was involved
 
01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
in approving some of those rules around
 
01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
Foster families but Foster families do
 
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
the foster homes do go through um what I
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
would view as a inspection and
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
permitting process even if the terms
 
01:33:25.470 --> 01:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
aren't that which are probably somewhere
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
near in the rules near where you find
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
that found that first one in
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
6446 but they're diff those honestly
 
01:33:35.149 --> 01:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes those rules are difficult
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
enough for the drafting attorneys within
 
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
the different departments to know each
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
of them that I'm not going to expect you
 
01:33:42.669 --> 01:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
to find everyone no so uh you're
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
actually bringing up some really really
 
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
good points about the lack of resource
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
recourse for following laws rules and
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
policy in the conflict um with the
 
01:33:52.510 --> 01:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
attorney general both um defending the
 
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
government and investigating the
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
government um also I think you brought
 
01:33:59.669 --> 01:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
up the idea that there's really nowhere
 
01:34:03.629 --> 01:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
for whistleblowers to go um that's
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
another area that I think is probably
 
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
very important um a as we look at this
 
01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
that's actually something that refers to
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
other departments and other parts of the
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
state too that might benefit from The
 
01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
Whistleblower one um looking at this
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
there's only so many things that people
 
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
can focus on at one time um my question
 
01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
at this this point taking this
 
01:34:26.910 --> 01:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
information and some others is whether
 
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
legislators should be looking at that
 
01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
inherent conflict and how we would
 
01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
address that while protecting
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
whistleblowers because there's a good
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
chance that some of the things that have
 
01:34:40.109 --> 01:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
happened if we had had whistleblowers
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
would have changed
 
01:34:44.590 --> 01:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah I can tell you right now there
 
01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
there's many whistleblowers and
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
obviously a lot of them try to stay
 
01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
protected at this point because they are
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
state employees themselves and they
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
don't want to be you know
 
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of the whistleblowers over the
 
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
years have been terminated wrongfully
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
and then sued the state for wrongful
 
01:35:00.189 --> 01:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
termination because they were
 
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
whistleblowing these problems you know
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
so there there's still plenty of
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
whistleblowers within the system uh you
 
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
know it's very well known and it's going
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
to continue and you know but the the
 
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
issue is is there's no real recourse you
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
know under the current mechanisms of how
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
the structure of DHHS is you know
 
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
because if you go ahead and terminate
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
these employees well then for cause then
 
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
you're admitting to the
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
problem you know and that that's the
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
biggest thing and they don't want to
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
admit to their wrongdoings because then
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
you have a $37 million lawsuit that gets
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
handed down and you know and that $37
 
01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
million could have helped a lot of fames
 
01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:48.870 align:start position:0%
million could have helped a lot of fames
that

01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
correct exactly but but in the meantime
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
you have so will use a general synopsis
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
of a a case of a child in Manchester
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
very high-profile case um those case
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
workers are over most of these other
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
cases that are also seeing lawsuits and
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
the ones that are still they're still
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
employed doing the same thing for many
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
other cases putting these children at
 
01:36:21.229 --> 01:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
risk Dennis V sorry no names yep a
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
another high-profile case in Lone where
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
the you know the grandmother was just
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
charged over the summer same exact thing
 
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
those are the same case works the same
 
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
case workers over the Manchester one are
 
01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:36.159 align:start position:0%
the same case workers over the lonia one
 
01:36:37.950 --> 01:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
they just moved them from one office to
 
01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:40.390 align:start position:0%
they just moved them from one office to
the

01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
next so
 
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
it's very interesting I mean it it takes
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
a very proactive person to get anything
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
done and even then you know they Tred to
 
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
shut down I've gone through seven
 
01:36:58.109 --> 01:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
different attorneys I've ended up um you
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
know terminating seven of their
 
01:37:01.709 --> 01:37:01.719 align:start position:0%
attorneys over the last four
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
years um and multiple supervisors and
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
case workers have been terminated
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
because of for cause
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
reasons but it it's coming from the top
 
01:37:13.950 --> 01:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
and it's trickling down and the people
 
01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
at the bottom are the ones taking the
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
blame for the actions of the people at
 
01:37:21.149 --> 01:37:21.159 align:start position:0%
the top you know we don't know exactly
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
who we have a good idea but it
 
01:37:25.709 --> 01:37:25.719 align:start position:0%
you know if people aren't coming to the
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
table you know and obviously the office
 
01:37:29.149 --> 01:37:29.159 align:start position:0%
of the child advocate has a good idea
 
01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
and you know they've brought it Forward
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
they brought it forward to the oversight
 
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
commission last month and said you know
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
we know who these people are but DHHS is
 
01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
not taking them out of play and they're
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
you know telling people to you know
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
redact that you know the office of the
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
child Havoc has subpoena powers and and
 
01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
yet these administrators are redacting
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
information from these oversight AG
 
01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:55.990 align:start position:0%
information from these oversight AG
genes

01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
genes
 
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
so we I'm sure we'll hear more tomorrow
 
01:38:01.229 --> 01:38:01.239 align:start position:0%
at the next session but thank you for
 
01:38:01.239 --> 01:38:03.189 align:start position:0%
at the next session but thank you for
your

01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
time yes thank you but so I think that's
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
about it for today I think that gives
 
01:38:12.669 --> 01:38:12.679 align:start position:0%
you a general synopsis of kind of what's
 
01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
been going on at least over the last six
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
months um and why some of this push back
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
and whatnot you might be you know
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
everywhere might be seeing on certain
 
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
things is it is perceived anyways from
 
01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
the conversations that I've had with
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
many different individuals that are
 
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
players at B is because of this Federal
 
01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
filed um thank you thank you that um
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
you're always very insightful when you
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
come up and it's become so much more
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
powerful after removing the names from
 
01:38:47.149 --> 01:38:47.159 align:start position:0%
your testimony because we can focus on
 
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
the facts correct instead of the names
 
01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
so thank you I would ask more questions
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
but I feel like you've given given me a
 
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
lot to go on um I I do feel like if
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
there was some process to hold the
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
government accountable and protect
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
whistleblowers that likely would both
 
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
protect children and protect families
 
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
exactly so yes definitely um and that's
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest things and actually
 
01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
uh recently I had you know the current
 
01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
administrator that's over the case tell
 
01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
me Well if a parent's releasing the case
 
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
then they should be in jail because DCF
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
was breaching confidentiality and Court
 
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
had upheld for them not to be breaching
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
this confidentiality and so we went a
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
little TI tip fortat with the laws and
 
01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
you know my attorney and I went ahead
 
01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
and shared the exact law where it does
 
01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
allow for parents now to go ahead and
 
01:39:39.149 --> 01:39:39.159 align:start position:0%
release information so long as the
 
01:39:41.589 --> 01:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
child's name is redacted under 170
 
01:39:44.950 --> 01:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
G and you know needless to say the
 
01:39:47.229 --> 01:39:47.239 align:start position:0%
division you know defaulted to saying
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
yes you know we apologize we are you
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
know XYZ but um I just to touch back on
 
01:39:56.350 --> 01:39:56.360 align:start position:0%
the foster care thing so under the
 
01:39:58.830 --> 01:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
administrative rules there's nothing
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
under statue in the definition or statue
 
01:40:04.750 --> 01:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
there is but because the administrative
 
01:40:09.229 --> 01:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
rules are more restrictive DHHS and DCF
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
is supposed to follow the administrative
 
01:40:14.350 --> 01:40:14.360 align:start position:0%
rules as the most restrictive now
 
01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
obviously they can go ahead and change
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
those administrative rules but they have
 
01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
not done so yet so when they go ahead
 
01:40:22.669 --> 01:40:22.679 align:start position:0%
and change them to make them less
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
restrictive as as the legislative has
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
done under RSA
 
01:40:30.669 --> 01:40:30.679 align:start position:0%
170 then there's a permitting process
 
01:40:33.070 --> 01:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
for individuals but currently under the
 
01:40:37.709 --> 01:40:37.719 align:start position:0%
more restrictive admin code there is not
 
01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
and we've had my legal team of many
 
01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
attorneys go ahead and oversee this and
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know address that so there is in the
 
01:40:49.589 --> 01:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
RSA so if you if you're in your legal
 
01:40:52.669 --> 01:40:52.679 align:start position:0%
team found areas with that um I I'll
 
01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:55.159 align:start position:0%
speak to you after on this sure not a
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
problem thank you all already thank you
 
01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:57.950 align:start position:0%
problem thank you all already thank you
thank

01:40:57.950 --> 01:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:41:03.629 --> 01:41:03.639 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you members of the
 
01:41:05.629 --> 01:41:05.639 align:start position:0%
committee representative Leah kushman
 
01:41:05.639 --> 01:41:06.550 align:start position:0%
committee representative Leah kushman
from

01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
where um so just from listening um to
 
01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
what was said up until now um I just
 
01:41:17.229 --> 01:41:17.239 align:start position:0%
have a few closing thoughts um so as far
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
as the cend assist letter um that it was
 
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
not written in legal jargon
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
it was literally said I am asking you to
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
immediately cease and assist because
 
01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
from the testimony that I received it's
 
01:41:35.709 --> 01:41:35.719 align:start position:0%
my belief based on it that there are
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
deprivation of Rights occurring and it
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
needs to stop now and so we can figure
 
01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:42.639 align:start position:0%
it out and at the end of the email it
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
said let's work together to make this
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
right I mean I think that stating that
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
that's the reason that we can't get DCF
 
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
in here um is I won't apply motive um
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
but I think it's wrong um I've sent
 
01:41:59.229 --> 01:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
similar emails about other issues I sent
 
01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
one to D DHHS um childcare licensing um
 
01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
division before because they were Den
 
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
they were not um enforcing the
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
requirement that dayc carees accept Rel
 
01:42:13.229 --> 01:42:13.239 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions um I've sent them
 
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
to you know it's just an email I'm I'm
 
01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
Duty Bound by my oath to call out
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
something wrong when I see it and say
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
hey this needs to be fixed can you tell
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
me how we can fix this
 
01:42:27.149 --> 01:42:27.159 align:start position:0%
um so it was a long email but so with
 
01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
that question um I I do know that with
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
those other ones that you referen those
 
01:42:34.990 --> 01:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
were very specific in the requests um
 
01:42:36.910 --> 01:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
and they were very effective in moving
 
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
forward because there was a gap that was
 
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
identified was the season um did you
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
feel that the seasoned assist on dcyf
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
was as narrowly drafted I do um it
 
01:42:51.149 --> 01:42:51.159 align:start position:0%
basically it said you can continue to do
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
the assessments but you can't be having
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
internal tribunals and if you're you're
 
01:42:58.990 --> 01:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
alleging abuse and neglect it needs to
 
01:43:01.709 --> 01:43:01.719 align:start position:0%
be it needs to be um put into the court
 
01:43:03.390 --> 01:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
where people have access to a trial by
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
jury um as guaranteed by the
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution and I
 
01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
mean you know I I don't think it can get
 
01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
much more specific than that but so I'm
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to state that that I I
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
even said I'm asking I implore I did not
 
01:43:23.189 --> 01:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
say I demand there were no demands made
 
01:43:25.589 --> 01:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
made it was here are problems I see I
 
01:43:27.629 --> 01:43:27.639 align:start position:0%
think we can't do this anymore please
 
01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
stop now let's figure out how to fix it
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
so that it's in line with
 
01:43:36.189 --> 01:43:36.199 align:start position:0%
Constitution um so that that's our job
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
um as the committee Char as for the
 
01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
committee charge legislation doesn't
 
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
only include bills um it's any action by
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
the legislature including issuing
 
01:43:47.070 --> 01:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
subpoenas warrants holding in contempt
 
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
for failing to appear um and comply and
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
for obstructing our work um even issu
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
punishments the house has that Authority
 
01:43:57.790 --> 01:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
per the Constitution um and that can go
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
into the report as recommendations that
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
we do that going forward with these
 
01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
people who are not complying with
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
subpoenas um with the OCA and the AG um
 
01:44:08.830 --> 01:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
in order to get DCF in here there is
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
already a process anyone saying there
 
01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
isn't I won't apply motive um but the
 
01:44:16.629 --> 01:44:16.639 align:start position:0%
Constitution and parliamentary law give
 
01:44:18.669 --> 01:44:18.679 align:start position:0%
the legislature the ability to subpoena
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
Witnesses um in New Hampshire it needs a
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
vote of the whole house uh I that's why
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
my attempt to form a committee that had
 
01:44:27.790 --> 01:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
subpoena power was brought to the floor
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
um so that it would be just the
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
committee because that's how it is under
 
01:44:31.950 --> 01:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
Masons and in a lot of other states and
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
in Congress the committee itself can
 
01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:35.679 align:start position:0%
issue subpoenas so it doesn't have to go
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
before the whole house um and that that
 
01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
gives us narrow power for the subject
 
01:44:42.550 --> 01:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
matter experts who are working on the
 
01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
issues um and so and it kind of
 
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
insulates it from broader political um
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
interplace um so the
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
so maybe recommending in the report that
 
01:44:58.390 --> 01:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
the next committee have that power um or
 
01:44:59.830 --> 01:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
recommending that there be a change to
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
house rules to give those types of
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
committees subpoena power if they don't
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
comply like they haven't with the OCA
 
01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
the house can issue a warrant given to
 
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
the sheriff um which is then served and
 
01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
the person is brought to the house the
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
house can then hold them and punish them
 
01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
it's in the
 
01:45:16.990 --> 01:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution um if you look at Mason's
 
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.310 align:start position:0%
Constitution um if you look at Mason's
section

01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:45:21.310 --> 01:45:21.320 align:start position:0%
802 um summon subpoenas and warrants a
 
01:45:23.149 --> 01:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
legislative body or committee when
 
01:45:24.270 --> 01:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
within the scope of his authority to
 
01:45:26.430 --> 01:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
conduct a uh investigation May summon
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
and examine Witnesses and require
 
01:45:29.149 --> 01:45:29.159 align:start position:0%
production and examination of books
 
01:45:31.030 --> 01:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
records and papers when a committee is
 
01:45:32.430 --> 01:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
authorized The subpoena Witnesses the
 
01:45:33.629 --> 01:45:33.639 align:start position:0%

01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
with its councel May select the names
 
01:45:36.910 --> 01:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
and number of witnesses for attention at
 
01:45:38.589 --> 01:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
each session and the chair May sign the
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
summons to each witness subpoena should
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
not be issued in blank so it just has to
 
01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
be specific uh when a witness lawfully
 
01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
summon refuses to appear a warrant may
 
01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
be issued to compel the witness's
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
attendance no affidavit charging
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
contempt need be filed for the house to
 
01:45:52.709 --> 01:45:52.719 align:start position:0%
authorize to issue its warrant to arrest
 
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
a contous person who refuses to testify
 
01:45:56.790 --> 01:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
before one of its committees the written
 
01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
report of the committee is sufficient
 
01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
Authority for the issuance of the
 
01:46:01.390 --> 01:46:01.400 align:start position:0%

01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%

apprehended and brought before the
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
committee by a sheriff under a warrant
 
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%

01:46:08.550 --> 01:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for misdemeanor under a
 
01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:10.719 align:start position:0%
statute for failure to to obey a
 
01:46:12.910 --> 01:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
subpoena which we don't have or punished
 
01:46:15.310 --> 01:46:15.320 align:start position:0%
for contempt by the legislature but that
 
01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.639 align:start position:0%
person cannot be punished by the
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
Judiciary for
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
contempt um the
 
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution gives more um illumination
 
01:46:25.950 --> 01:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
to that power the house shall have
 
01:46:27.870 --> 01:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
authority to punish by imprisonment
 
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
every person who shall be guilty of
 
01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
disrespect to the house in its Presence
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
by any disorderly or contemptuous
 
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
Behavior or by or by obstructing its
 
01:46:39.149 --> 01:46:39.159 align:start position:0%
deliberations um or in disturbing any
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
one of the officers in exe execution of
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
any order of procedure of the house or
 
01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
in rescuing any person arrested by order
 
01:46:47.790 --> 01:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
of the house knowing them to be such so
 
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
like it's alluding there that we have
 
01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
that ability it's not really an arrest
 
01:46:53.229 --> 01:46:53.239 align:start position:0%
like where you um like where the
 
01:46:55.149 --> 01:46:55.159 align:start position:0%
executive branch would um under law
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement arrest somebody the warrants
 
01:46:59.950 --> 01:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
that uh A legislature issues are are
 
01:47:02.229 --> 01:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
strictly to force the appearance of
 
01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
someone who is a subpoena and and
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
refused to comply with the subpoena and
 
01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:09.400 align:start position:0%
then the the sergeant of AR at arms are
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
constables they have all of the um
 
01:47:13.629 --> 01:47:13.639 align:start position:0%
Authority that a constable has and
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
including detaining an individual and
 
01:47:19.229 --> 01:47:19.239 align:start position:0%
then the house can make a resolution um
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
right then to apply a punishment on its
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
own it doesn't need the Senate doesn't
 
01:47:25.750 --> 01:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't um act it's not acted upon
 
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
like a bill um they can say the
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
punishment is this person stays chained
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
to the the chair you know in the
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
speaker's office for the duration of the
 
01:47:37.070 --> 01:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
day or the house hereby finds you in
 
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
contempt of the the house the you know
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire house and it's a Scarlet
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
Letter for forever um a fine is even
 
01:47:46.149 --> 01:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
less than that so I think that there's
 
01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
case law that that states um it's a
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
lesser punishment so it's also um
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
applicable and can be issued
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
um because it's lesser than imprisonment
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
there's other case uh other crimes that
 
01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
have um been prosecuted as such in
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
courts of law but I I think we have the
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
authority to
 
01:48:07.470 --> 01:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
punish um to go get somebody and force
 
01:48:09.070 --> 01:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
them to appear and force them to to
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
bring their documents um I think that a
 
01:48:15.310 --> 01:48:15.320 align:start position:0%
lot of people just don't know um so the
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh in our house yeah it has to all the
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
in the house rules number six it says
 
01:48:20.430 --> 01:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
all warrants subpoenas and other
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
processes issued by the house shall be
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
signed by the speaker attested to by the
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
clerk so we we have it on our rules it's
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
acknowledged there we do have warrant
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
power um as for representative Weber's
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
comment she can say that she doesn't
 
01:48:32.990 --> 01:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
agree that cases need to go before a
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
trial by jury um but I think it's
 
01:48:37.470 --> 01:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
antithetical to the O oath and it's in
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
conflict with the Constitution and
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
recent um uh Supreme Court um rulings
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
the punishment before being um having a
 
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
finding in an administrative tribunal or
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
in the Family Court they're already
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
being punished they're already having
 
01:48:55.709 --> 01:48:55.719 align:start position:0%
their children removed from them um it
 
01:48:57.589 --> 01:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate if they were
 
01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
arrested for an allegation of a crime
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
and then were in jail or had bail
 
01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
conditions where they couldn't have
 
01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679 align:start position:0%
access to the child until their their
 
01:49:08.669 --> 01:49:08.679 align:start position:0%
due process can be um you know carried
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
out but before you make a finding you're
 
01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
you're already issuing severe punishment
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
to these people for three four five six
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
months before they even have their
 
01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
dispositional a judicatory hearing um in
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
the family court or their um their
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
internal Tri tribunals where the parents
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
aren't even given notice to appear and
 
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
they just receive the finding in the
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
mail that's all sidest stepping to due
 
01:49:32.189 --> 01:49:32.199 align:start position:0%
process so um it's a civil death pen
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
penalty essentially and um I I implore
 
01:49:37.470 --> 01:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
you all to read SEC versus daresi it was
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
about the SEC but it's similar it's an
 
01:49:41.669 --> 01:49:41.679 align:start position:0%
administrative tribunal where the state
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
is basically the agency is a is is a is
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
a judge in its own case um and that's
 
01:49:50.669 --> 01:49:50.679 align:start position:0%
unlawful and basically the the finding
 
01:49:52.189 --> 01:49:52.199 align:start position:0%
was that if if at the time of the
 
01:49:55.950 --> 01:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
founding a a similar cause of action um
 
01:49:57.870 --> 01:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
came with a right to a trial by jury you
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
can't just change its name and its venue
 
01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
and change the rules around it and
 
01:50:02.589 --> 01:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
deprive constitutional due process and
 
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
say that you don't get a trial by jury
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
um so child abuse child abuse is a crime
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
neglect is a crime harm of children is a
 
01:50:13.390 --> 01:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
crime it needs to be prosecuted by law
 
01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement heard in an open trial in a
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
real Court um of law that ensures no
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
arbitrary decision- making that we keep
 
01:50:21.629 --> 01:50:21.639 align:start position:0%
hearing constantly happens in family
 
01:50:24.270 --> 01:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
court and and tribunals in DCF and with
 
01:50:26.709 --> 01:50:26.719 align:start position:0%
the substantive due process requirements
 
01:50:29.109 --> 01:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
um with DCF interacting before it ever
 
01:50:31.629 --> 01:50:31.639 align:start position:0%
goes to to court um and it needs to have
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
no conflicts of interests and we've
 
01:50:36.189 --> 01:50:36.199 align:start position:0%
heard that the the federal incentives
 
01:50:38.350 --> 01:50:38.360 align:start position:0%
present a conflict of interests if it
 
01:50:39.950 --> 01:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't rise to the level of a crime
 
01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
then the government has no authority to
 
01:50:45.470 --> 01:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
be interfering um with consent they can
 
01:50:48.149 --> 01:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
provide voluntary services but that's it
 
01:50:50.069 --> 01:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
they should be giving people family
 
01:50:52.830 --> 01:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
therapy they should be giving people
 
01:50:54.990 --> 01:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
parenting classes I think that's a
 
01:50:57.790 --> 01:50:57.800 align:start position:0%
legitimate role for DCF I don't think
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
that criminal quasi criminal quasi civil
 
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
investigations without due process is
 
01:51:05.709 --> 01:51:05.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate for them um there's no
 
01:51:06.990 --> 01:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
significant difference between the
 
01:51:10.109 --> 01:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
ongoing litigation cases involving YDC
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
and dcyf which expose the problematic
 
01:51:14.430 --> 01:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
practices of warehousing children and
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
tearing families apart for profit per
 
01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
government program funding and the
 
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
actions of the Bureau for child support
 
01:51:21.589 --> 01:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
services and family court which
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
similarly practice separating families
 
01:51:25.709 --> 01:51:25.719 align:start position:0%
and creating a pipeline of children for
 
01:51:27.709 --> 01:51:27.719 align:start position:0%
profit profit the business model
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
practice has seven commonalities the age
 
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
of the child Financial projections
 
01:51:34.910 --> 01:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
protraction me methods ways to make the
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
case carry on because it creates more
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
money artificial story creation
 
01:51:41.589 --> 01:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
deflecting responsibility onto targeted
 
01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
families and children void of concern
 
01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
and care for the children and families
 
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
and no intent to stop and avoiding
 
01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:48.910 align:start position:0%
and no intent to stop and avoiding
account

01:51:48.910 --> 01:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
accountability all of those are are
 
01:51:54.189 --> 01:51:54.199 align:start position:0%
common in all three of those Arenas um
 
01:51:56.669 --> 01:51:56.679 align:start position:0%
and their patterns it was said that
 
01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
there were no patterns to recognize I
 
01:51:59.790 --> 01:51:59.800 align:start position:0%
think there's tons of patterns that that
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
have been brought that we can recognize
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
so I I'll finish with um recommendations
 
01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:05.470 align:start position:0%
so I I'll finish with um recommendations
for

01:52:05.470 --> 01:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
legislation um number one how about body
 
01:52:10.069 --> 01:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
cameras for social workers subject to
 
01:52:12.589 --> 01:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence we hear a lot of
 
01:52:15.629 --> 01:52:15.639 align:start position:0%
hearsay um that's entered upon the court
 
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
and and parents say that it was a lie
 
01:52:20.430 --> 01:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
and there's never any um followup for
 
01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
perjury even when it's proven that it
 
01:52:24.270 --> 01:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
was was a lie and also exemption from
 
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
wiretapping laws for members of the
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
public recording government servants um
 
01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
I believe constitutionally that's
 
01:52:32.109 --> 01:52:32.119 align:start position:0%
already the case you have a right to to
 
01:52:35.310 --> 01:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
record government servants um fixed
 
01:52:36.510 --> 01:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
language in the statute that was
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
inserted with SP 417 from this year that
 
01:52:41.109 --> 01:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
creates a litmus teest for Parental
 
01:52:43.069 --> 01:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
Fitness for parents not charged with
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
abuse most of the the cases um for
 
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights don't
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
have an an accompanying criminal charge
 
01:52:53.550 --> 01:52:53.560 align:start position:0%
of abuse so that's of those parents and
 
01:52:55.950 --> 01:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
it's the parents who aren't even alleged
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
to have abused in those administrative
 
01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
courts either um the the fitness test
 
01:53:04.270 --> 01:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
has a bunch of vague requirements um you
 
01:53:06.669 --> 01:53:06.679 align:start position:0%
know and and some of it violates the Ada
 
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
untreated mental illness I mean that's
 
01:53:10.229 --> 01:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
that's violating the Americans for
 
01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
Disabilities Act and what's untreated if
 
01:53:14.430 --> 01:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
they take St John's wart is that
 
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
untreated instead of an SSRI you know um
 
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
I think that there's just a lot of room
 
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
for for uh a narrative to be created and
 
01:53:28.629 --> 01:53:28.639 align:start position:0%
um orders to be issued that uh you know
 
01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
is based on someone's opinion and it's
 
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
not it's not uh objective um a part of
 
01:53:39.990 --> 01:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
that is also that a parent compliance
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
with dcyf is weighed for or against them
 
01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
in maintaining their children and with
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
over $5 million in lawsuits every year
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
for maladministration for child deaths
 
01:53:53.790 --> 01:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
for all kinds of rights violations by
 
01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
this um agency it's not a wonder why
 
01:53:59.709 --> 01:53:59.719 align:start position:0%
parents don't want to comply with them
 
01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
and don't want to engage with them um so
 
01:54:04.069 --> 01:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
I think that needs to be struck but
 
01:54:06.189 --> 01:54:06.199 align:start position:0%
aside from that you can remove all of
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
these problems if we removed DCF from
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
the child abuse and neglect
 
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
investigation side of things and
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
relegate it to placing children with no
 
01:54:18.109 --> 01:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
family and providing services such as
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
family therapy and parenting classes
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
voluntarily child abuse investigations
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
back into the hands of law enforcement
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
like it was um until the 1970s that
 
01:54:30.189 --> 01:54:30.199 align:start position:0%
would end here say evidence Anonymous
 
01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
reporting that can be weaponized it
 
01:54:35.229 --> 01:54:35.239 align:start position:0%
removes the ability to um that that uh
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
Anonymous reporting removes the ability
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
to face your accuser and cross-examine
 
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
Witnesses who assert the charges uh
 
01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
allegations against you
 
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
um it it it would restore due process in
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
these cases easily swiftly put it in
 
01:54:53.310 --> 01:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
courts of law they have to follow
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
um consistent Rules of Evidence and the
 
01:54:58.709 --> 01:54:58.719 align:start position:0%
jury finds the facts not just a judge
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
and you know we've heard that there's
 
01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
seems to be rubber stamping going on a
 
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
jury's not going to rubber stamp
 
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
anything you know that that's why we
 
01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
have a trials by jury because it's
 
01:55:11.629 --> 01:55:11.639 align:start position:0%
considered the best way to ensure a fair
 
01:55:13.390 --> 01:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
process right where jurries find the
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
facts um ensure that all funding for
 
01:55:17.589 --> 01:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
dcyf and prosecution of abuse and
 
01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
neglect cases is from the state budget
 
01:55:21.149 --> 01:55:21.159 align:start position:0%
and not federal programs that create
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
conflicts and that prosecution occurs in
 
01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
courts of law not quasi criminal quasi
 
01:55:27.149 --> 01:55:27.159 align:start position:0%
civil quasi Equity courts that are
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
Guided by an amalgamation of statutes
 
01:55:30.750 --> 01:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
that sidestep Constitution will due
 
01:55:33.629 --> 01:55:33.639 align:start position:0%
process and thereby you can eliminate
 
01:55:36.790 --> 01:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
any um arbitrary application of law
 
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
amend house rules to give subpoena power
 
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
and warrant power to the Committees to
 
01:55:42.430 --> 01:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
and inform legislator legislators of
 
01:55:44.109 --> 01:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
that power give the Committees more
 
01:55:46.069 --> 01:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
direct oversight and enforcement power
 
01:55:48.510 --> 01:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
right now the whole house has it we have
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
it to say we don't is not true and then
 
01:55:53.470 --> 01:55:53.480 align:start position:0%
bills of address
 
01:55:55.709 --> 01:55:55.719 align:start position:0%
the clerk has mentioned uh to me that
 
01:55:57.950 --> 01:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
state employees for state employees the
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
equivalent of an impeachment in the
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
house is a bill of address I don't know
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
much about that process um but I think
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
it's something that needs to be examined
 
01:56:07.550 --> 01:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
more because there are people named in
 
01:56:09.589 --> 01:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
numerous lawsuits and complaints who are
 
01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
still sitting in their positions and
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
able to harm Children and Families
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
hiding records forging records let's
 
01:56:19.390 --> 01:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
file bills of address um and as far as
 
01:56:21.709 --> 01:56:21.719 align:start position:0%
whistleblowers uh there's already laws
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
for that to protect
 
01:56:26.990 --> 01:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
them so if other branches are failing to
 
01:56:28.350 --> 01:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
protect them or failing to give them
 
01:56:30.109 --> 01:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
standing like we saw with ER Anna
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
carrian um in their whistleblower cases
 
01:56:35.069 --> 01:56:35.079 align:start position:0%
the legislature needs to take the
 
01:56:37.550 --> 01:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
investigator role we have broad powers
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
to investigate um as I've described with
 
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement for non-compliance and all
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
of that so thank you very much for

ideas that representative kushman had

the idea making sure that it has its
 
01:57:26.069 --> 01:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
