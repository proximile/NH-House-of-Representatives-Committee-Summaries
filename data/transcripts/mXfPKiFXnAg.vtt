470 uh I'll have representative Muse

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you very
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
much um I have a draft Amendment uh that
 
00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh I'm proposing today uh members of the
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
committee also have a marked up version
 
00:13:31.949 --> 00:13:31.959 align:start position:0%
uh of the original bill that actually
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
shows where the uh the specific changes
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
are but to give you a a highlevel
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
overview um one of the things that I
 
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
tried to do in putting this together was
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
really not only listen uh to folks who
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
are are basically trying to expand drug
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
checking and trying to do the best they
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
can to to save lives but um I I also
 
00:13:58.749 --> 00:13:58.759 align:start position:0%
tried to listen to some of the the very
 
00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
very legitimate concerns of law
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement and one of those concerns
 
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
was around um striking the words testing
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh and analyzing uh from the drug drug
 
00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia law altoe the concern that
 
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
was raised was that uh people who
 
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:17.720 align:start position:0%
manufacture and compound uh illegal
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
drugs uh use this equipment and uh one
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
of the concerns that they rais is for
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
folks like that uh possession of this
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
equipment for compounding and
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing purposes should continue
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
to be a crime so one of the another way
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
to come at this is to create a clearer
 
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
exemption uh for drug checking uh
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
equipment uh and processes which which
 
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
I've tried to done to do um so in the
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
amendment one of the things that we have
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
in there that's not in the original bill
 
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
is the language for HB 287 which we
 
00:14:58.749 --> 00:14:58.759 align:start position:0%
passed earlier this year which legalizes
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips and xylazine test
 
00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:04.759 align:start position:0%
strips so uh at the time we actually put
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
this particular bill in uh HP 470 uh
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
neither one of the two bills had been
 
00:15:12.749 --> 00:15:12.759 align:start position:0%
passed but we're not in that situation
 
00:15:12.759 --> 00:15:15.230 align:start position:0%
passed but we're not in that situation
anymore

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
um so uh so the text for 270 is in there
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
um I think it's also important to
 
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
realize that um that the bill does uh
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
some other important things uh so for
 
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
instance one of the issues that you can
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
potentially have uh with drug checking
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
is that while we've made we've made it
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
um uh essentially we've we've uh
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
decriminalized the use of uh fentel and
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
xylazine test drips by uh people who are
 
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
actually using the drugs what we haven't
 
00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
really done is
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
decriminalized um supplying those uh and
 
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
and and having used test strips uh in
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
the possession of people you know who
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
are actually helping people with you
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
know with the test strips and with with
 
00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:07.959 align:start position:0%
the drug checking so one of the things
 
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to try to do uh in this
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
particular Amendment and in this
 
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
particular Bill uh is to address that
 
00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we are trying to do
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
is to really acknowledge that when it
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
comes to contaminant and adulterant in
 
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
the drug Supply um it's a continually
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
moving Target and
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
currently the approach that we've take
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
or the approach the approach that we
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
took with with HB 287 were was to create
 
00:16:42.269 --> 00:16:42.279 align:start position:0%
two specific exceptions for uh fentanyl
 
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
test strips and pryazine uh test strips
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
to the uh to the drug paraphernalia law
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
um meanwhile we've heard that there are
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
other contaminants such as lolle uh
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
benzodiazapine uh that are actually in
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
the drug Supply and are being found in
 
00:16:59.550 --> 00:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
the drug Supply
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
benzodiazapine uh is uh more familiar I
 
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
think to a lot of people same class of
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
drugs as uh
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
Valium uh and lorazapam
 
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
and uh what they do is they produce a
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
more they they produce a uh kind of an
 
00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:22.039 align:start position:0%
accentuated or accelerated kind of a
 
00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:24.799 align:start position:0%
high the danger is is in combination
 
00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:25.590 align:start position:0%
high the danger is is in combination
with

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
cocaine um in combination with opioids
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
and some of the other things that they
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh can be cut with they can have an
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
unpredictable result uh probably not as
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
devastating as as fentanyl uh but still
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
potentially very damaging for the folks
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
who use
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
them uh um
 
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
liso uh is actually a uh a drug that is
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
an anti-parasitic drug that uh looks an
 
00:17:57.549 --> 00:17:57.559 align:start position:0%
awful lot uh like uh Like Cocaine uh
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
from what I understand so it's used as a
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
cutting agent
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
um this is again uh another drug that uh
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
that can produce um uh effects similar
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
to xylazine with open wounds and things
 
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
of that nature uh and uh I believe it it
 
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
also can produce uh clef pellet uh in
 
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
children uh you know uh so we we're
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
we're talking about things that um are
 
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
starting to enter the drug the drug
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
Supply now that we really don't have a
 
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
way of accounting for and and I think
 
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we wanted to try
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
to do with with this bill and the
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
changes to this bill is to create more
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility um that would allow uh that
 
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
would allow these drugs to be tested
 
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
before they're used um and and I think
 
00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
the idea is you know to save as many
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
lives as we can uh and I think the other
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
part of it is one of the things that
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
we're seeing as especially with things
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
like xylazine and LOL is that some of
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
these the negative impacts for people um
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
the wounds that they create um the
 
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
difficulty of treating some of these
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
wounds um uh create uh a burden on the
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
system uh that that has to treat F the
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
folks that have to treat them um and can
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
create long lasting damaging impacts in
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
in people who never really had any idea
 
00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:28.039 align:start position:0%
uh that they were taking these drugs in
 
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
the first
 
00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:33.799 align:start position:0%
place um kind of going
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
over some of the other things that the
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
amendment uh that the amendment
 
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.390 align:start position:0%
amendment uh that the amendment
does

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
see one of the one of the things that
 
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
has come up in some of our uh some of
 
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
our discussions is the definition of a
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
nominal amount and I wanted to I wanted
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
to speak to that um uh in other states
 
00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:03.799 align:start position:0%
uh 10 mg uh when a nominal amount is
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
defined uh does tend to be the amount uh
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
that's chosen and there are a couple of
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
reasons for that um one is if you look
 
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
in the the Center for Disease controls
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
material on you know on drug checking um
 
00:20:20.669 --> 00:20:20.679 align:start position:0%
uh 10 milligrams is the recommended
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
amount for checking and uh there's there
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
was there's actually a brochure by the
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
New York City Health Department that I
 
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
ran into
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
uh that'll give you an idea just how
 
00:20:32.909 --> 00:20:32.919 align:start position:0%
small uh an amount 10 milligrams
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
actually is it's actually an an amount
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
of drugs that when crushed would
 
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
basically cover Lincoln's hair on a
 
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
penny um and while some test strips are
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
are capable of uh providing a result um
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
with only a few grains one of the issues
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
that you run into as a practical matter
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
um is
 
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know how do you handle uh you
 
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
know how do you handle a drug uh that
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
you're trying to have checked um uh you
 
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
know when you're talking about that
 
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
smaller quantity so 10
 
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.190 align:start position:0%
smaller quantity so 10
milligrams

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
milligrams
 
00:21:20.669 --> 00:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
um just so just so we're all uh sure
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
this is a little spoon uh uh that Miss
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
McGinley handed out uh when she
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
testified uh here uh uh last week and
 
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
you know it it actually shows uh how
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
small a quantity that is imagine you
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
know trying to get that amount of
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
quantity that quantity into a plastic
 
00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
bag into a small bottle into to a
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
position where you can test it
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
so even at 10 milligrams we're not
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
talking about something that's going to
 
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
be really easy for people to do um but
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about something that's
 
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
possible for people to do if we decrease
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
the amount to less than 10 Mig you know
 
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
we're potentially talking about putting
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
a few grains in a plastic bag and then
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
when you open the plastic bag you know
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
you're going where are the grains
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
because we're literally talking you know
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
very very small grains so as a as a
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
practical matter one of the reasons why
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh 10 milligrams is in there and specifi
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
it as we thought it was important to
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
specify a quantity number one but we
 
00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
also wanted to
 
00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:35.559 align:start position:0%
be I think to to try and be as clear as
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
possible uh you know around um what the
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
see another thing that is in here let me
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
see let me just see if I can find
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:03.549 align:start position:0%
see let me just see if I can find
this

00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so so I think the really the the
 
00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
big thing to and and I think the big
 
00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
take takeaway from this amendment are
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
the objections that law enforcement had
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
around removing testing and analyzing um
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
have been acknowledged in this amendment
 
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
that language is actually back in there
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
and what we've tried to do and I think
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
what we've done is we've more clearly
 
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
separated um
 
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
uh the difference between in the in the
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
context between using this equipment for
 
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
compounding and Manufacturing versus
 
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
using it for drug checking and and if
 
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
you look at our drug paraphernalia laws
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
in general I think one of the things
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
that you you find is that the context of
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh paraphernalia is very important and
 
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
what we're we're basically saying with
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is that drug checking does
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
provide um a different a different
 
00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
context so so for examp for example
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
weighing and measuring equipment testing
 
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
and analyzing equipment um the equipment
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
itself is perfectly illegal what makes
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
it illegal is when you use when you use
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
it to manufacture compound uh or
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
distribute a controlled substance that's
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
what makes it
 
00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:20.919 align:start position:0%
illegal um so I think that by more
 
00:24:20.919 --> 00:24:22.590 align:start position:0%
illegal um so I think that by more
clearly

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
delineating um the exception for drug
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
checking um and leaving the existing
 
00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
language in otherwise
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
intact uh should address a lot of the
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.269 --> 00:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
heard represent
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
new yeah I just have a quick question
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
about drug checking you've used that
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
term a couple of times and it seems to
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
me that it it's still blurry in my mind
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
as to drug checking that the individual
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
would do compared to the the J drug
 
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
checking that a manufacturer would do
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
are both of those referred to as drug
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
checking in the
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
laws drug checking actually refers to um
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh basically an enduser somebody who's
 
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
prepared to inest ingest the drugs
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
having the ability to use a test strip
 
00:25:20.669 --> 00:25:20.679 align:start position:0%
or some other testing process uh in
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
order to identify a potential
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
contaminant so for instance if you think
 
00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
you're buying oxy codone pills um uh but
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
you're not quite sure because you've
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
heard you know that it's pretty common
 
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
for fentanyl pills to be sold instead or
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
for Oxycodone to be combined with
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
fentanyl one of the things you can do is
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
you can use a fentanyl test strip to
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
detect the presence of Fentanyl and you
 
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
or you can use a a xylazine test strip
 
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
to to detect uh the presence of
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
xylazine um getting things like test
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
strips and Drug tricking equipment into
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
the hands of people who who are using
 
00:26:02.389 --> 00:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
drugs is really where Public Health
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
people and uh people in the harm
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
reduction Community like Miss McGinley
 
00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
have have come in there there is federal
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
money available to do that and and so
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
part of one of the one of the things
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
that the bill also does is make sure
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
that they're not prosecuted because
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
they're not actually using the uh the
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
drug checking equipment what they're
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
doing is basically Distributing it to
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
people who can use it uh and that's
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where we are I hope that
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
question it kind of does I'm just
 
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
talking about I'm talking more about
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
words than than situations I mean drug
 
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
checking is it refers to the individual
 
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
like you said now it also refers to the
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
people that provide this the equipment
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
the strips and stuff like that to do it
 
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
and then is there another drug checking
 
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
that is done by big manufacturers or
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
legally is that well that's testing and
 
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
analyzing okay so and that can be done
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
legally by a pharmaceutical company or
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
illegally by somebody with a basement
 
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
lab okay thank you uh Representatives uh
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
representative Muse if we could take a
 
00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
look directly at your Amendment and
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
we'll uh
 
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.789 align:start position:0%
we'll uh
that's

00:27:29.789 --> 00:27:29.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.799 --> 00:27:32.350 align:start position:0%
 
2023

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
2422 and for the committee if we could
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
just start to focus on the bolded words
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
and uh it's the
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
amendment 2023
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
2422 not not there yet so where the we
 
00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
see the bolded words uh and that should
 
00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:54.519 align:start position:0%
be page
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
two uh line 12 drug
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia and it just looks like
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
that replaces the word
 
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
it I see no issues with that does anyone
 
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
issues and then we will move down to
 
00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
line 21 where testing equipment used or
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
intended for use Etc has been struck and
 
00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
it is now testing equipment used or
 
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
intended for use in the manufacturing
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
compound and converting processing or
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
preparing of Controlled Substances for
 
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
illegal sales and or distribution in
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
order to identify or analyze the
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
strength Effectiveness or purity of a
 
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.590 align:start position:0%
strength Effectiveness or purity of a
controlled

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
controlled
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
or no okay we'll move
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
on yeah go ahead this is can be an open
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
this out of the amendment or is that so
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
it in representative Muse can speak
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
about this where it is struck out will
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
be removed from the actual statute and
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
and this will be added and this is in
 
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
terms of actual like a penalty for uh
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
this is the illegal of the this is yes
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
this this this would be the illegal
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:20.519 align:start position:0%
clarification this
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
clarify it's a clarification that really
 
00:29:27.509 --> 00:29:27.519 align:start position:0%
is um is uh being more specific about
 
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
when the use of this testing equipment
 
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
is illegal um and what it and by by
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
wording in it in this way it actually um
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
opens the door to the exception for drug
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
checking which we've already done with
 
00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.990 align:start position:0%
checking which we've already done with
HB

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.389 align:start position:0%
 
287

00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
287
 
00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:49.519 align:start position:0%
repr I just want to be super clear
 
00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:50.919 align:start position:0%
because I and and correct me if I'm
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
wrong uh representative news but so when
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about is this where
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
it makes it not where it makes it legal
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
is this where it legalizes this is the
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
definitions right so this is clarifying
 
00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
the definition not necessarily in this
 
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
section right here in this line it's not
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
saying this is where it's this it's
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
legalized this is uh clarifying the
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
definition so that later when we talk
 
00:30:16.509 --> 00:30:16.519 align:start position:0%
about what is legal and what is not it
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
parses it more clearly am I saying that
 
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
correct okay you said it much better
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
did thank
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
you now we will move on to page
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
three uh line
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
18 notwithstanding provisions of RSA 318
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
B1 XA or unless possessed in conjunction
 
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
with other evidence forming the basis of
 
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
a criminal charge involving
 
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturing possessing with intent to
 
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
sell or compounding pursuant to RSA 318
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
include

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
so if if you look at uh at a um when we
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
passed HB 287 and the governor signed it
 
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
uh and legalized fentanyl stress test
 
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
strips and xylazine test strips um we
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
had a change in the statute that wasn't
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
accounted for originally so what you
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
have in a is the uh is the exact change
 
00:31:22.629 --> 00:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
that we made the reason why the second
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
part of it is actually crossed out uh is
 
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0%
to avoid having to repeat repeat that um
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
three more times in b c and d so that
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
exemption would apply to uh uh so unless
 
00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
possessed in conjunction with other
 
00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:42.519 align:start position:0%
evidence forming the basis of a criminal
 
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
charge involving the manufacturing
 
00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:46.519 align:start position:0%
possession and intent to sell or
 
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
compounding pursuant uh so this is
 
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
language that we was actually
 
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
incorporated into 287 in the Senate um
 
00:31:58.029 --> 00:31:58.039 align:start position:0%
that we will incor incorporate into the
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
statute but rather than doing it four
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
times in ABC and D we just do it up at
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
top with XB so basically the way it
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
reads is notwithstanding the provisions
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
of RSA 318 B1 XA or unless possessed in
 
00:32:14.629 --> 00:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
conjunction with other evidence forming
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
the basis of a criminal charge involving
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing possessing with intent
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
to sell or compounding uh person went to
 
00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
RSA 318 B2 uh one drug paraphernalia
 
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
shall not include include so this is the
 
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
section that basically uh exempts U
 
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
uh exempts drug checking equipment from
 
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
uh the paraphernalia statute and
 
00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
provides that clearer dividing line uh
 
00:32:47.789 --> 00:32:47.799 align:start position:0%
for uh for drug checking that um that in
 
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
a way that doesn't impact the ability of
 
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to uh apply the drug
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia law on somebody who is is
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
using testing and analyzing equipment to
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:06.679 align:start position:0%
drugs uh representative Muse was that
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
language you said was taken right from
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
the Senate's bill or is this yeah this
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
what happened we uh the senate had some
 
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
changes to HB 287 uh there was an
 
00:33:20.629 --> 00:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
amendment uh after we passed it and sent
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
it over to the Senate uh the final
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
version includes this language I I
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
actually I wanted the hand out is
 
00:33:29.629 --> 00:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
actually the the final language of HB
 
00:33:33.629 --> 00:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
287 HB 287 which really inserts one
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
RSA okay thank you I just I have an
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
issue with that Senate's bill because it
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
says possessing with intent to sell it
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
says nothing about possession and I know
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
that that kind of gets clarified but I
 
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
guess that's not for us to really kind
 
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
of debate on the bill that was already
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
passed uh anything on that at all or
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
should I move on to the next one next
 
00:33:57.039 --> 00:33:58.549 align:start position:0%
should I move on to the next one next
one

00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh we'll drop down to B Other Drug
 
00:34:03.789 --> 00:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
checking equipment used to inform
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
individuals of whether a substance has
 
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
been adulterated by the presence of a
 
00:34:10.829 --> 00:34:10.839 align:start position:0%
synthetic opioid or another controlled
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
substance or un undisclosed chemical
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
compound or
 
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
contaminant so what this does would it
 
00:34:22.109 --> 00:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
gives us the ability to uh and you know
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
and would give uh Public Health organ
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
organizations and harm reduction
 
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
organizations that are doing this work
 
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
the ability to introduce new drug
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
sharing equipment uh for different
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
compounds and adulterants um without
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
necessarily having to come back to us to
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
amend the statute so we've amended the
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
statute um uh to uh exclude uh xylazine
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
test strips and Fentanyl test strips uh
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
from our drug paraphernalia law what
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
what this would do is it would open the
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
door for for example there are
 
00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:57.640 align:start position:0%
contaminants like l
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
benzodiazapine uh that are now uh
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
entering the drug Supply what what it
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
would do is it would make it legal uh
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
for uh drug checking equipment that test
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
for those compounds uh to be used as
 
00:35:14.589 --> 00:35:14.599 align:start position:0%
well so the advantage of having language
 
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
like this is that every time there's a
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
new scientific advance that makes it
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
easier to detect something um that
 
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
somebody should know is in the drugs
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
that they're taking a contaminant an
 
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:27.640 align:start position:0%
adulterant or different
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh controlled substance that would give
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
us the flexibility to be able to do this
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
without having to come back and change
 
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
the statute every
 
00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.630 align:start position:0%
the statute every
time

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
repr just to add to that and piggy back
 
00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
on it and I know we're not at this
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
section yet but I think that it's really
 
00:35:46.589 --> 00:35:46.599 align:start position:0%
important to remember when we're talking
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
about including this in it that there is
 
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
actually a definition of drug checking
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
equipment that that goes through it so
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
it's not just like a wide openen um it
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
yeah it is it is still specified as well
 
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean thank you I know
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
we'll get to that when we get to it but
 
00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
I think that is important one more as
 
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
always with laws you get a look from one
 
00:36:10.309 --> 00:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
law to find what the meaning is and it's
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
it's very convoluted if you're not into
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
the law uh we'll move down to C
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
materials used by staff and volunteers
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
of agencies and organizations that
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
provide harm reduction Services
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
authorized by the state a county a
 
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
municipality or a public health
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
department in the processing preparing
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
packaging repackaging storing or
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
containing of a nominal amount of a
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
controlled substance for the purpose of
 
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.910 align:start position:0%
controlled substance for the purpose of
confirmatory

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
confirmatory
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
testing and and I think the what the
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
intent of this is is to make sure that
 
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
um folks like Miss McGinley uh who are
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
working in the harm reduction community
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
and who are actually working you know
 
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
with folks who are using drugs um you
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
know con conceivably under our law now
 
00:36:58.309 --> 00:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's possible for them to be
 
00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
prosecuted if they have things like used
 
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips uh and things like
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
that so we just want to make sure that
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
um that there is uh some kind of an
 
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
exemption uh for people who are trying
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
to get the service out there in the
 
00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
community um uh again all the other
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
things apply um but this is basically
 
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
just sort of closing the loop and I
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
think what we're really trying to do
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
with this bill in a lot of ways is just
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
sort of to to close sort of some of the
 
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
loops we created when we passed 287 you
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
know it just it basically just goes that
 
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
tight thank
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
you D drug checking equipment use
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
purchase transported or distributed by
 
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
staff and volunteers of agencies and
 
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
organizations that Pro provide harm
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
reduction Services authorized by the
 
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
state a county a municipality or a
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
public health
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
department same sort of thing you know
 
00:37:58.990 --> 00:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
currently um with the exception of
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
xylazine strips and Fentanyl test strips
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
drug checking equipment is considered
 
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:03.870 align:start position:0%
drug checking equipment is considered
drug

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
drug
 
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia um and this exemption
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
really applies specifically to staffs
 
00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
and volunteers of agencies um that are
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
dealing uh with harm uh you know in you
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
know with harm reduction programs uh and
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
and who basically are really responsible
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh for getting the stuff into the
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
community and making sure that you know
 
00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
ideally as as many people as possible
 
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
you know given the current environment
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
where uh there's so much contamination
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
um and uh and where fentanyl is such a
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
such an issue uh for so many people um
 
00:38:46.829 --> 00:38:46.839 align:start position:0%
what it would do is basically give them
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
um you know the ability to do that
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
law looks like we're going to move on to
 
00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.470 align:start position:0%
law looks like we're going to move on to
page

00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
five line
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
three drug checking paraphernalia should
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
not include drug checking equipment or
 
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
materials used in the processing
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
preparing packaging repackaging storing
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
or containing normal amounts for the
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of drug checking as identified
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
XC and I think what this is is the the
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
drug paraph fam your
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
see yeah and this this this essentially
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh is the exemption that I think we had
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
earlier this this basically is the part
 
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
that's telling telling them tell it
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
telling folks that drug checking
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
equipment um is basically not considered
 
00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:03.079 align:start position:0%
to be drug paraphernalia under New
 
00:40:03.079 --> 00:40:06.990 align:start position:0%
to be drug paraphernalia under New
Hampshire

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
law that looks like and and the and what
 
00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
it does what it also does is it
 
00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.359 --> 00:40:25.109 align:start position:0%
 
XB

00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
okay believe that's it for uh what you
 
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
added for language into this uh
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment does anyone on the committee
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
have any questions Pros cons about the
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
US Representative new I mean I guess I
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
just say um I think that this really
 
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
responds a lot to um very well to the to
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
the feedback that we've gotten
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
um since the first iteration of it um
 
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
and includes what we've already made law
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
I just I think that it's um I can't see
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
any problems with it I guess that's what
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
I'll say and I think that it resolves a
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
lot of the problems that we've been
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
going back and forth about for the last
 
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
your real quick um I appreciate all of
 
00:41:28.349 --> 00:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
the hours you spent on and all the work
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
um I I and I we too have done um a lot
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
of uh looking into this in other states
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
and in theory and everything this sounds
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
and looks great but in practice it has
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
not um is not panned out um I still see
 
00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.710 align:start position:0%
not um is not panned out um I still see
it's

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:47.720 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
just I still don't it doesn't set right
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
with me all these um changes and
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
so that's really really
 
00:42:04.109 --> 00:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
it nothing F thank you uh
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative I understand the concern
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
that uh that some folks have with
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh the idea that drug checking is
 
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
something that might
 
00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
enable um bad behavior you know
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
essentially or or you know behavior that
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
encourage I think part of what we're
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
really trying to do and I think the
 
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
whole thing that we're trying to do here
 
00:42:36.549 --> 00:42:36.559 align:start position:0%
is to help um is to help save a few more
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
lives I I think we realize that given
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
the the nature of the fentanyl epidemic
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
epidemic and given the nature of drug
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
use we're not going to reach everybody
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
but um drug checking in particular has
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
been shown to be extremely effective you
 
00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
know in colleges um parties Gatherings
 
00:43:02.109 --> 00:43:02.119 align:start position:0%
things like that um not necessarily ever
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
going to be 100% effective but um you
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
know it's discouraging uh I think a
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks ago there was an article
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the Manchester Union leader that
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
updated you know the drug fatality
 
00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:20.559 align:start position:0%
statistics and I mean despite of all the
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
efforts of law enforcement all the
 
00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
efforts of folks like Miss McGinley and
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
the harm reduction community all the
 
00:43:29.309 --> 00:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
efforts of folks in this
 
00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:31.559 align:start position:0%
legislature um we still have people
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
dying at a very high rate of Fentanyl
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
and opioid
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
overdoses and I think one of the things
 
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that everybody
 
00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
understands is I I am in no way with
 
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
this bill trying to get in the way of
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
anything that law enforcement is doing
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
to uh to make it harder for people who
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
are bringing these drugs in the market
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm you know I I think all of
 
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
those efforts are are are are fine and
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
we probably should be brainstorming more
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
ways to help help law enforcement with
 
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
things like that this is simply another
 
00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
way to come at it you know one of the
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
things I think that we're all none of us
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
want is to see any more people die in
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
this epidemic and there are very few
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
things we can do in our law that can
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
create uh a result uh and you know this
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
is one of them it's been consistently
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
shown uh to be effective in states where
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
it's implemented like anything that we
 
00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
do it's not 100% effective um but it's
 
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
better than what we have now and in the
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
middle of an epidemic I'll take better
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
than what we have now
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
anytime thank you representative re um I
 
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
think that it depends on what statistics
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
you look at um because um in Oregon
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
there has been no proven decrease in
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
overdose death overdose deaths with
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
these harm reduction measures um and
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
also uh um one thing that I was told is
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
that if you remove some of these um
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
penalties that um one Avenue for people
 
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
to seek help is through incarceration
 
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
their first entry into a recovery
 
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
program is through incarceration and
 
00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
we're taking that away
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
um by these some I mean xylazine has
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
proven great in the um fentanyl test
 
00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
strips but I think that um you know to
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
further this along has not fished out in
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
areas like Portland Oregon where they're
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
they had passed laws similar to this
 
00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
with and they're are you know working
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
them back because they just are not
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
working so um I guess we can find
 
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
statistics to support you know what we
 
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:57.640 align:start position:0%
want a point we want to make um when we
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
have to look at really in real life
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
what's going on Portland um is not a
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
model City
 
00:46:07.549 --> 00:46:07.559 align:start position:0%
for you know our legislation that we're
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
trying to propose if it was successful
 
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
and you know and and it they had hard
 
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
quality you know if they weren't in the
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
news every day with how terrible things
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
are going I might be more open to it but
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's just not work it's not the image
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
that is is being shown it's not as
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
effective as we had hoped thank you
 
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
thank you represent
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
man um just a couple points of
 
00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
clarification because what Oregon did
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
was Oregon passed they legalized uh it's
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
different for different drugs right um
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
different substances but I think for
 
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
heroin for example it's one gram we're
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
talking about 10 milligrams which that's
 
00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
one 100th one thing I I wish what what
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
I've learned learned is that in in um
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for example when they
 
00:47:01.549 --> 00:47:01.559 align:start position:0%
passed uh you know this this type of
 
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
legislation and they used rather than
 
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
using the word nominal amount which we
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
have defined as uh 10 milligrams what
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
they used was residual amount and I I H
 
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
I I honestly wish that we could just use
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
that they actually tried to clarify it
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
because people weren't comfortable with
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
having it VI a word like that that that
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't more clear so we're trying to
 
00:47:21.309 --> 00:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
clarify it based on the cdc's definition
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
of what is the very little but what I
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
but I uh you know I I think um the the
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
spoon for example was very um um Visual
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
and being able to actually Envision what
 
00:47:34.829 --> 00:47:34.839 align:start position:0%
that is but residual is is literally
 
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
like what is left in a bag after you
 
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
empty it out so if we're if we're
 
00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
talking about I mean I could i' I've
 
00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
read the stud read some studies about um
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
what happened in Oregon and Oregon has
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
um their overdose deaths have increased
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
at the same rate as other all around the
 
00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
rest of the country I mean it's just
 
00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's comparable yes yes it's
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
increased and um so so has it here so
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
has it in many other places so it's it's
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's not anyway um I don't I don't think
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
they're in any worse position but the
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
fact is is what they did was they
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
legalized up to a gram for example
 
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
that's a very different amount than what
 
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do here so I just really
 
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
want to to hone in and clarify that
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
decriminalization of um of of like a
 
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:25.480 align:start position:0%
gram of anything or you know I mean it's
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very different prospect that
 
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here and very
 
00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
very focused on this one thing so when
 
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
we compare it to places like Oregon and
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
and you know I'm not going to say
 
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
anything about Oregon you know but but
 
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
the fact is is when we compare it to
 
00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
laws that have
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
legalized 100 times as much as what this
 
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
is I think we're doing a real disservice
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
to actually like paying attention to to
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
what is in this bill and you know
 
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
looking at how effective or you know uh
 
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
what the impact of it would be because
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
we're just not comparing Apples to
 
00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
Apples here
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative and this is
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
this is where I'm torn again like I said
 
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
at the last meeting that I don't want to
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
see people die I just really wish that
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
we could get to the root cause of
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
addiction and I know that's almost like
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
a a a journey that it's almost seems
 
00:49:18.119 --> 00:49:20.069 align:start position:0%
a a a journey that it's almost seems
impossible

00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh having the law enforcement background
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
I see both sides so this is where I'm
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
kind of on the teeter totter uh the
 
00:49:28.589 --> 00:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
testimony that we've heard over this has
 
00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
been has been excellent
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh again we just really need to get down
 
00:49:35.309 --> 00:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
to the root cause of it
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
and prevent people from taking this
 
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
journey that they probably never wanted
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
to in the first place uh if there's
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
nothing further does uh any member have
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
present I move uh ought to pass uh HB uh
 
00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
470 with Amendment uh
 
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
2023-24 22 is there a
 
00:50:05.309 --> 00:50:05.319 align:start position:0%

Newman what you oh I I I thought you had
 
00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
to pause I apologize uh representative

470

01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.199 --> 02:38:14.710 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:14.720 --> 03:02:23.349 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:02:23.349 --> 03:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:26.070 --> 03:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
welcome to the criminal justice um
 
03:02:28.710 --> 03:02:28.720 align:start position:0%

03:02:31.670 --> 03:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
been retained we are going to be
 
03:02:33.990 --> 03:02:34.000 align:start position:0%

03:02:35.870 --> 03:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to stop for a few minutes
 
03:02:37.389 --> 03:02:37.399 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we're waiting for a couple
 
03:02:42.030 --> 03:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:44.030 --> 03:02:44.040 align:start position:0%

03:03:12.479 --> 03:15:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
now

03:15:54.870 --> 03:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:57.910 --> 03:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
here today should be uh relatively short
 
03:16:00.150 --> 03:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
since we last met we took a tenative
 
03:16:04.710 --> 03:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
vote on a proposal and um over over the
 
03:16:07.510 --> 03:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
weekend since then um I have had
 
03:16:10.670 --> 03:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
conversations with uh many
 
03:16:13.670 --> 03:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and um representative gath
 
03:16:15.990 --> 03:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
and I have also had conversations and
 
03:16:17.790 --> 03:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
we've decided to to fine-tune it a
 
03:16:20.830 --> 03:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more and um add some new
 
03:16:24.110 --> 03:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
proposals so I'm going to read these and
 
03:16:25.229 --> 03:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to see if we can get a
 
03:16:26.750 --> 03:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
consensus on these so that we can get
 
03:16:29.269 --> 03:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
them printed up keeping in mind we have
 
03:16:31.910 --> 03:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
to have this voted out next week the
 
03:16:34.189 --> 03:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
deadline is the 17th and we need to get
 
03:16:36.630 --> 03:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
them out by the 15th just so we can make
 
03:16:39.110 --> 03:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
sure OS has the right language to go to
 
03:16:42.950 --> 03:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
the floor so the current bail statute as
 
03:16:45.950 --> 03:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
it is is going to have several changes
 
03:16:48.510 --> 03:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
but substantially the structure isn't
 
03:16:51.189 --> 03:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
changing new felony arrest for somebody
 
03:16:52.550 --> 03:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
who's out on
 
03:16:56.670 --> 03:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
bail already is held for a judge so if
 
03:16:58.990 --> 03:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
you are out on bail and you get arrested
 
03:17:01.229 --> 03:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
for a felony you are held for the judge
 
03:17:04.469 --> 03:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
if it's a weekend if it's a uh excuse me
 
03:17:06.710 --> 03:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
if it's a weekday if it's a weekend you
 
03:17:09.070 --> 03:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
will be heard by one of the magistrates
 
03:17:10.189 --> 03:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to get into that in a
 
03:17:15.150 --> 03:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
second um so in effect no one's going to
 
03:17:16.830 --> 03:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
be held for more than 24 hours with
 
03:17:18.510 --> 03:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
somebody without somebody hearing their
 
03:17:20.510 --> 03:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
their case deciding whether or not
 
03:17:21.710 --> 03:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to go on
 
03:17:24.429 --> 03:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
bail um and remember this is in response
 
03:17:26.429 --> 03:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
to the Senate bill that
 
03:17:29.070 --> 03:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
had um a whole list of people who just
 
03:17:31.189 --> 03:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
were going to be held for four
 
03:17:33.790 --> 03:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
days um with no opportunity to be heard
 
03:17:33.800 --> 03:17:34.750 align:start position:0%
days um with no opportunity to be heard
by

03:17:34.750 --> 03:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:17:39.309 --> 03:17:39.319 align:start position:0%
anyone uh next is um let me see anyone
 
03:17:42.150 --> 03:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
who's arrested for a class A M
 
03:17:44.870 --> 03:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor while they're out on bail if
 
03:17:46.910 --> 03:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
they have a history of two or more
 
03:17:49.950 --> 03:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor convictions convictions they
 
03:17:52.590 --> 03:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
will also be in the same situation as if
 
03:17:55.070 --> 03:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
someone had been arrested for a felony
 
03:17:57.229 --> 03:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
does everyone get that so youve get your
 
03:17:58.750 --> 03:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
felony if you get do a felony while
 
03:18:02.189 --> 03:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
you're on Bale you're held and if you
 
03:18:05.070 --> 03:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
have a new class A misdemeanor with a
 
03:18:06.830 --> 03:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
history of two misdemeanor convections
 
03:18:10.229 --> 03:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
also held again same 24-hour rule
 
03:18:12.469 --> 03:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
applies either magistrate or judge
 
03:18:15.670 --> 03:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:18.469 --> 03:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
week yeah it is helpful actually CU I'm
 
03:18:20.670 --> 03:18:20.680 align:start position:0%
reading off the tiny print um next we
 
03:18:23.189 --> 03:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
added the um we added the felony
 
03:18:25.070 --> 03:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
versions of the Senate Bill the senate
 
03:18:28.990 --> 03:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
had 13 crimes that they were proposing
 
03:18:31.710 --> 03:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
that could not be heard by a bill
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner we took that list but we're
 
03:18:37.510 --> 03:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
only adopting the felony versions of it
 
03:18:40.750 --> 03:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
not the misdemeanor versions of it um
 
03:18:42.189 --> 03:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion whether or not
 
03:18:44.870 --> 03:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
not we should keep possession of child
 
03:18:46.510 --> 03:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
pornography on there as to whether or
 
03:18:49.790 --> 03:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
not that made someone a danger or not um
 
03:18:52.070 --> 03:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
we're of the opinion that um that should
 
03:18:54.429 --> 03:18:54.439 align:start position:0%
be for a judge to decide not for us
 
03:18:56.189 --> 03:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
that's a serious enough crime that who
 
03:18:58.189 --> 03:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
knows what else you're involved in if
 
03:19:00.469 --> 03:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
you have child pornography it could be
 
03:19:02.469 --> 03:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
that you are involved in manufacturing
 
03:19:04.189 --> 03:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
certainly you are supporting through
 
03:19:08.510 --> 03:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
your um possession of that the
 
03:19:12.110 --> 03:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
trade so again the Senate list of the 13
 
03:19:14.349 --> 03:19:14.359 align:start position:0%
crimes we are adopting as they requested
 
03:19:16.110 --> 03:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
but only the felony versions not the
 
03:19:18.110 --> 03:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors that would be held and not
 
03:19:20.110 --> 03:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
be able to see a judge I mean excuse me
 
03:19:21.469 --> 03:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
a baill
 
03:19:23.750 --> 03:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner um the electronic
 
03:19:25.189 --> 03:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
monitoring we discussed we're still
 
03:19:26.750 --> 03:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
going to keep it but we're going to
 
03:19:29.469 --> 03:19:29.479 align:start position:0%
mandate it just more surgically to where
 
03:19:31.510 --> 03:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's most appropriate and that's people
 
03:19:33.790 --> 03:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
who get a domestic violence restraining
 
03:19:36.349 --> 03:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
order on them that says you cannot be in
 
03:19:37.870 --> 03:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
contact or within so many feet of
 
03:19:39.870 --> 03:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
somebody those people are going to be
 
03:19:42.110 --> 03:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
mandated to have to wear if they're
 
03:19:44.950 --> 03:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
bailed a electronic monitor where they
 
03:19:46.950 --> 03:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
can ensure that that person does not go
 
03:19:49.550 --> 03:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
where they're not supposed to go um
 
03:19:50.870 --> 03:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
which would be caused for immediate
 
03:19:53.110 --> 03:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
arrest and if you are arrested for a
 
03:19:54.950 --> 03:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
violation of a straining order that's
 
03:19:57.189 --> 03:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
also not bailable until you see a
 
03:19:59.550 --> 03:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
judge the bail fee we've already
 
03:20:01.870 --> 03:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
discussed we're increasing it at $50 the
 
03:20:04.189 --> 03:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
Court's going to pay it to the bail
 
03:20:04.199 --> 03:20:05.630 align:start position:0%
Court's going to pay it to the bail
Commissioners

03:20:05.630 --> 03:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioners
 
03:20:08.710 --> 03:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
monthly the court can recoup the money
 
03:20:10.510 --> 03:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
from the defendants as we discussed
 
03:20:12.229 --> 03:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
earlier if they're indent the Court can
 
03:20:14.710 --> 03:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
make a determination of that um whether
 
03:20:16.830 --> 03:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
or not to make them pay we are going to
 
03:20:19.790 --> 03:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
allow the court a year to collect if
 
03:20:22.349 --> 03:20:22.359 align:start position:0%
they decide the person can um my
 
03:20:23.910 --> 03:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
conversations with the court has
 
03:20:26.110 --> 03:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
generally they don't pursue collecting
 
03:20:28.429 --> 03:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
funds from people who are Indigent
 
03:20:29.830 --> 03:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
however they'll make that determination
 
03:20:31.269 --> 03:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
because it's coming out of their budget
 
03:20:33.590 --> 03:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
so if they uh if they want to get their
 
03:20:36.110 --> 03:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
money back they've got a year to do it
 
03:20:36.120 --> 03:20:37.630 align:start position:0%
money back they've got a year to do it
next

03:20:37.630 --> 03:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
next
 
03:20:40.750 --> 03:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
um the education of bail Commissioners
 
03:20:42.229 --> 03:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
we've already discussed that that has
 
03:20:45.590 --> 03:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
not changed still the um the requirement
 
03:20:48.349 --> 03:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
will stay for the times and for new bail
 
03:20:50.429 --> 03:20:50.439 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and for
 
03:20:52.950 --> 03:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
magistrates um we're adding that victims
 
03:20:56.150 --> 03:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
can be heard in any bail hearing victims
 
03:20:57.870 --> 03:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
will have the right now to go to a bail
 
03:20:59.870 --> 03:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
hearing and argue why the person should
 
03:21:01.750 --> 03:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
not have bail that would be the hearing
 
03:21:03.750 --> 03:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
in front of the judge not with a bail
 
03:21:05.150 --> 03:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner or magistrate in the middle
 
03:21:07.269 --> 03:21:07.279 align:start position:0%
of the night but at the original bail
 
03:21:09.870 --> 03:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
hearing when they get to the judge if
 
03:21:12.630 --> 03:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
someone is released on bail
 
03:21:15.070 --> 03:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
and there's a victim it's a crime
 
03:21:17.870 --> 03:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
against a person the police have to
 
03:21:22.229 --> 03:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
notify the um victim within um to give
 
03:21:24.189 --> 03:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
them one hour before the person's
 
03:21:27.710 --> 03:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
released so right now person just gets
 
03:21:29.070 --> 03:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
released and if they get notified they
 
03:21:30.950 --> 03:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
get notified before the person can be
 
03:21:32.910 --> 03:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
released they have to notify the victim
 
03:21:35.510 --> 03:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
one hour prior to that if the victim
 
03:21:37.309 --> 03:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
leaves their contact information so that
 
03:21:41.469 --> 03:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
they can get them um let me see and the
 
03:21:43.349 --> 03:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
police have have to document the fact in
 
03:21:45.110 --> 03:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
the time where they went to notify the
 
03:21:47.389 --> 03:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
person the police are allowed to notify
 
03:21:49.469 --> 03:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
them earlier if someone's picked up and
 
03:21:51.070 --> 03:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
it appears they're going to make bail
 
03:21:52.590 --> 03:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
the police can go say it looks like he's
 
03:21:54.189 --> 03:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
going to make bail here's your
 
03:21:56.269 --> 03:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
notification but in no case can it be
 
03:21:57.630 --> 03:21:57.640 align:start position:0%
less than an
 
03:22:02.309 --> 03:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
hour um and finally U bail Commissioners
 
03:22:04.950 --> 03:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
or magistrates and judges must provide
 
03:22:07.550 --> 03:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
the accused with information on local
 
03:22:09.389 --> 03:22:09.399 align:start position:0%
Services related to homelessness hunger
 
03:22:11.830 --> 03:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
mental health and substance abuse issues
 
03:22:12.750 --> 03:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
when they're picked up bail
 
03:22:14.070 --> 03:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners already have to hand them
 
03:22:16.469 --> 03:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
a stack of paperwork that's provided by
 
03:22:17.630 --> 03:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
the court this is just going to be one
 
03:22:19.150 --> 03:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
more piece of paper the court has to
 
03:22:21.150 --> 03:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
print for whatever bail commission the
 
03:22:23.389 --> 03:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
locality the bail commissioner serves so
 
03:22:26.070 --> 03:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
they can hand out this information to
 
03:22:28.950 --> 03:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
the person um when they are
 
03:22:31.510 --> 03:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
bailed and that is the substance of the
 
03:22:36.349 --> 03:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
changes discussion what so if the go
 
03:22:40.110 --> 03:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
ahead I Mr chairman if I may just
 
03:22:44.070 --> 03:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
clarify the the notification of a victim
 
03:22:46.389 --> 03:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
is that where the police or you know
 
03:22:48.870 --> 03:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
somebody has to attempt to make contact
 
03:22:51.309 --> 03:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
with that victim or is it actually
 
03:22:53.189 --> 03:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
making the contact like let's say the
 
03:22:54.510 --> 03:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
person just you know didn't answer their
 
03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
phone or they're just kind of hiding for
 
03:22:57.030 --> 03:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit and don't want to answer
 
03:22:59.150 --> 03:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
their phone what what exactly how that
 
03:23:01.349 --> 03:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
looked the way we're contemplating
 
03:23:02.990 --> 03:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
writing it is that the police have to
 
03:23:05.870 --> 03:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
make an effort to contact the victim at
 
03:23:08.389 --> 03:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
the name and address that they leave if
 
03:23:09.790 --> 03:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
they are not able to leave them they
 
03:23:10.790 --> 03:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
have to leave a message or a
 
03:23:13.229 --> 03:23:13.239 align:start position:0%
notification at the address saying that
 
03:23:14.750 --> 03:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
here's your notification this person is
 
03:23:16.710 --> 03:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
released we're not going to hold people
 
03:23:18.309 --> 03:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
while the they're chasing down the
 
03:23:19.910 --> 03:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
victims cuz sometimes steer point they
 
03:23:23.150 --> 03:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
may not even they may not care beond the
 
03:23:25.990 --> 03:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
arrest further discussion representative
 
03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
Harry gther you might want to add that
 
03:23:30.670 --> 03:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
because right now we just have iners or
 
03:23:32.910 --> 03:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
telephone okay when we put the when we
 
03:23:34.389 --> 03:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
put the language for the actual it'll
 
03:23:36.910 --> 03:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
say may notify this way and that way and
 
03:23:38.229 --> 03:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
we'll put that in
 
03:23:38.239 --> 03:23:40.349 align:start position:0%
we'll put that in
there

03:23:40.349 --> 03:23:40.359 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:23:43.429 --> 03:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
um yeah it will be documented uh
 
03:23:43.439 --> 03:23:45.389 align:start position:0%
um yeah it will be documented uh
representative

03:23:45.389 --> 03:23:45.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:23:49.309 --> 03:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
Muse yes um first of all thank you for
 
03:23:51.429 --> 03:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
the uh for the work on this this is
 
03:23:54.269 --> 03:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
we've been a long been a long tough road
 
03:23:56.150 --> 03:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
getting uh getting to a point where we
 
03:23:57.750 --> 03:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
actually have some things that we've
 
03:24:00.830 --> 03:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
we've agreed on there uh there were some
 
03:24:03.189 --> 03:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
things that um you did not mention that
 
03:24:04.630 --> 03:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make sure what the
 
03:24:07.309 --> 03:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
status of those were to um one of them I
 
03:24:09.030 --> 03:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
know is one is something that's pretty
 
03:24:11.189 --> 03:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
near and dear to your heart which is the
 
03:24:13.750 --> 03:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
the syst that would actually connect uh
 
03:24:16.429 --> 03:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to bail bail status
 
03:24:18.990 --> 03:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
information uh that the court system has
 
03:24:20.950 --> 03:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
my my understanding that's part of this
 
03:24:24.030 --> 03:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
as well that is correct I I didn't bring
 
03:24:25.309 --> 03:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
that up because it wasn't a change I
 
03:24:26.910 --> 03:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
thought we discussed it last week but a
 
03:24:30.950 --> 03:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
good point um the the bill portion that
 
03:24:33.389 --> 03:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
pertains to technology we will be
 
03:24:33.399 --> 03:24:34.630 align:start position:0%
pertains to technology we will be
providing

03:24:34.630 --> 03:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
providing
 
03:24:36.670 --> 03:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
$750,000 to the Department of Public
 
03:24:41.150 --> 03:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
Safety and $950,000 to the court to make
 
03:24:43.429 --> 03:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement and the court system
 
03:24:47.389 --> 03:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
talk to each other in spots so that bail
 
03:24:49.590 --> 03:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
will be updated as quick to as real time
 
03:24:52.429 --> 03:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
is possible and law enforcement and
 
03:24:53.670 --> 03:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
through law enforcement bail
 
03:24:55.870 --> 03:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioners or magistrates will know
 
03:24:57.830 --> 03:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
if someone's on bail and what their
 
03:25:00.189 --> 03:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
record is at the time they make the bail
 
03:25:03.710 --> 03:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
so that will be included in the in the
 
03:25:06.110 --> 03:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
bill there are a couple of other things
 
03:25:07.630 --> 03:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
oh go on by all means just just just to
 
03:25:09.750 --> 03:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
make sure we have them another one is
 
03:25:11.830 --> 03:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
the reinsertion of the original bail
 
03:25:15.349 --> 03:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
reform uh provision uh that doesn't
 
03:25:17.349 --> 03:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
allow people accused of criminal
 
03:25:20.229 --> 03:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
offenses to be held simply because they
 
03:25:23.510 --> 03:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
can't make a cash bail it's basically
 
03:25:24.990 --> 03:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
yes you can be held if you're a Flight
 
03:25:27.189 --> 03:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
Risk if you keep getting arrested or
 
03:25:28.429 --> 03:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
you've been shown by clear and
 
03:25:30.469 --> 03:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence to be a person of
 
03:25:31.910 --> 03:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
high risk when it comes to committing
 
03:25:36.550 --> 03:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
another violent crime but no um if it's
 
03:25:39.150 --> 03:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
just you can't make bail because you
 
03:25:41.910 --> 03:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
can't afford it that is correct we are
 
03:25:44.750 --> 03:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
the the current statute um provides for
 
03:25:46.429 --> 03:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
that no one shall be held and we're not
 
03:25:48.670 --> 03:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
changing that um I believe even the
 
03:25:51.030 --> 03:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
first uh paragraph may even reiterate
 
03:25:53.150 --> 03:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
that no one shall be held just because
 
03:25:55.110 --> 03:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
of the fact that they don't have money
 
03:25:57.150 --> 03:25:57.160 align:start position:0%
to to make a bail or no bail shall be
 
03:25:58.870 --> 03:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
set for the sole purpose of keeping
 
03:26:00.510 --> 03:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
someone because the court knows they
 
03:26:03.229 --> 03:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
don't have money so um we're definitely
 
03:26:04.830 --> 03:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
staying away from you're either
 
03:26:07.309 --> 03:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
dangerous and you're held or you're not
 
03:26:09.030 --> 03:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
you're a Flight Risk in you're held or
 
03:26:11.070 --> 03:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
you're not um if you're released there
 
03:26:12.630 --> 03:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
can be conditions but we're not
 
03:26:15.670 --> 03:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
contemplating cash as part of that and
 
03:26:17.349 --> 03:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
the the the final one was the
 
03:26:19.710 --> 03:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
establishment of a of a Governor's
 
03:26:22.429 --> 03:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
commission uh to actually work out how
 
03:26:25.429 --> 03:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
to make uh pre-trial interventions more
 
03:26:28.269 --> 03:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
consistent across the counties uh
 
03:26:30.429 --> 03:26:30.439 align:start position:0%
potentially involving funding and things
 
03:26:32.150 --> 03:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
of that nature which we found in our
 
03:26:34.910 --> 03:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
discussions to be pretty inconsistent
 
03:26:37.830 --> 03:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
pretty irregular um and very much
 
03:26:39.630 --> 03:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
necessary if we're actually going to
 
03:26:42.309 --> 03:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
move the needle you know in terms of of
 
03:26:44.229 --> 03:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh trying to address the problem of
 
03:26:46.830 --> 03:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
homeless people people with mental
 
03:26:48.510 --> 03:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
health and substance abuse issues
 
03:26:50.189 --> 03:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
getting arrested over and over and over
 
03:26:54.590 --> 03:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
again um yeah thank you um in our in our
 
03:26:56.389 --> 03:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
studies we've determined that such a
 
03:26:58.389 --> 03:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
commission already exists um it's called
 
03:27:01.750 --> 03:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
the inter Branch commission that has all
 
03:27:03.870 --> 03:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
the same people that we want it was the
 
03:27:06.349 --> 03:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
people that work well not the exact
 
03:27:08.389 --> 03:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
people but the same offices that worked
 
03:27:11.389 --> 03:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
on the original 2018 bill it has the
 
03:27:13.870 --> 03:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
Judiciary it has the um attorney general
 
03:27:16.510 --> 03:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
it's got the um County attorney it's got
 
03:27:18.630 --> 03:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
everybody who could possibly be involved
 
03:27:20.710 --> 03:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do is retask that
 
03:27:22.389 --> 03:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
committee rather commission rather than
 
03:27:23.710 --> 03:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
create a new Commission because they
 
03:27:25.670 --> 03:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
still exist I was approached by the
 
03:27:27.189 --> 03:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
speaker's office whether or not that
 
03:27:28.670 --> 03:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
should be repealed because they're going
 
03:27:30.349 --> 03:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
through looking at all these zombie
 
03:27:31.910 --> 03:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
commissions that are out there and I
 
03:27:33.790 --> 03:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
told them no this one not we're actually
 
03:27:37.189 --> 03:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
going to use it so um what you discussed
 
03:27:39.150 --> 03:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
is um among the things several things
 
03:27:40.950 --> 03:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to task them with one of
 
03:27:43.030 --> 03:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
them being being to look at a potential
 
03:27:46.429 --> 03:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
Statewide pre-trial Services um and
 
03:27:48.229 --> 03:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
methods to maybe make that happen such
 
03:27:51.870 --> 03:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
as create a fund that counties if they
 
03:27:54.950 --> 03:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
create a system can apply to for um
 
03:27:56.710 --> 03:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
potential reimbursement if they meet a
 
03:27:59.349 --> 03:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
minimum criteria things of that nature
 
03:28:01.870 --> 03:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
um we were also going to have them look
 
03:28:04.269 --> 03:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
at a total top- down review of the
 
03:28:06.030 --> 03:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system with regard to
 
03:28:07.550 --> 03:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
the way the agencies and counties
 
03:28:09.590 --> 03:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
interact during all the hearings we've
 
03:28:11.870 --> 03:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
had the hundreds of ours testimony we
 
03:28:15.030 --> 03:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
saw large disconnects um between the
 
03:28:17.550 --> 03:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
branches and between agencies within the
 
03:28:21.309 --> 03:28:21.319 align:start position:0%
same Branch um and it came to our
 
03:28:22.950 --> 03:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
attention that the whole thing needs to
 
03:28:25.110 --> 03:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
be looked at from the top down and I
 
03:28:27.710 --> 03:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
think that's a perfect job for that that
 
03:28:29.349 --> 03:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
group what else were we gonna
 
03:28:31.469 --> 03:28:31.479 align:start position:0%
representative Ro if you
 
03:28:36.550 --> 03:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
recall oh um thank you Mr chairman um I
 
03:28:38.670 --> 03:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
I did speak with a few people whenever I
 
03:28:40.630 --> 03:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
was here early today uh one of the
 
03:28:43.070 --> 03:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
things that you and I I discussed was
 
03:28:45.750 --> 03:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
about making sure that there's actually
 
03:28:49.229 --> 03:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
a victim's Advocate division in all of
 
03:28:51.990 --> 03:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
the courts and currently there most
 
03:28:54.750 --> 03:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
definitely is something for sexual
 
03:28:57.429 --> 03:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
assaults and my understanding is that
 
03:28:59.150 --> 03:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
the public defender's office I'm sorry
 
03:29:02.030 --> 03:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
that the um attor oh my gosh the county
 
03:29:03.990 --> 03:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
attorney's office does have uh victim
 
03:29:06.030 --> 03:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
Advocates but it's it's really unclear
 
03:29:06.040 --> 03:29:06.910 align:start position:0%
Advocates but it's it's really unclear
as

03:29:06.910 --> 03:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:29:10.150 --> 03:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
to what extent they are able to advocate
 
03:29:11.670 --> 03:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
for for some of these victims so in
 
03:29:13.750 --> 03:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
other words if somebody happens to be
 
03:29:16.229 --> 03:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
you know mugged on the street you know
 
03:29:18.429 --> 03:29:18.439 align:start position:0%
what actually are the parameters of this
 
03:29:20.790 --> 03:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
victim's Advocate to to help and a lot
 
03:29:23.189 --> 03:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
of times the victim's Advocate is really
 
03:29:26.309 --> 03:29:26.319 align:start position:0%
just a a communication person between
 
03:29:28.590 --> 03:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
the victim and the actual attorney so we
 
03:29:30.429 --> 03:29:30.439 align:start position:0%
want to actually make sure that the that
 
03:29:32.469 --> 03:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
the services are are made available to
 
03:29:34.990 --> 03:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
the victim as you know we hear so often
 
03:29:36.750 --> 03:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
about services that are actually made up
 
03:29:39.150 --> 03:29:39.160 align:start position:0%
to the person that is arrested so we're
 
03:29:42.110 --> 03:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
going to work on that yeah I um I'd
 
03:29:44.550 --> 03:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
actually we're going to ask them to to
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
look into the potential to create a
 
03:29:49.030 --> 03:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
specific office within the Judiciary or
 
03:29:51.510 --> 03:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere either in there or within the
 
03:29:53.950 --> 03:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
County attorneys um I prefer actually
 
03:29:57.309 --> 03:29:57.319 align:start position:0%
the court um an office of victim witness
 
03:29:59.990 --> 03:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
Advocate often Witnesses are left
 
03:30:02.469 --> 03:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
hanging in the wind um and they're often
 
03:30:04.710 --> 03:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
threatened and they also risk a lot of
 
03:30:08.030 --> 03:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
things or need services so um it's
 
03:30:10.070 --> 03:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
inconsistent right now I believe across
 
03:30:11.590 --> 03:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
all the counties in the state
 
03:30:13.429 --> 03:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
as far as the availability of someone
 
03:30:15.590 --> 03:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
who knows how to help or get them with
 
03:30:18.189 --> 03:30:18.199 align:start position:0%
the protection they need or whatnot um
 
03:30:19.630 --> 03:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
so we're going to ask them also to look
 
03:30:21.510 --> 03:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
into that the creation of a victim
 
03:30:24.429 --> 03:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
witness Advocate was there anything else
 
03:30:26.309 --> 03:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
we had a whole laundry list of things we
 
03:30:28.710 --> 03:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask them to do and that bill
 
03:30:31.269 --> 03:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
will be brought to us next week on uh
 
03:30:33.790 --> 03:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
Tuesday when we exec and it will I'll
 
03:30:35.750 --> 03:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
send it out this weekend for everyone to
 
03:30:38.990 --> 03:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
see the final version um of things we're
 
03:30:41.429 --> 03:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
going to ask them to look into as part
 
03:30:46.550 --> 03:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:49.070 --> 03:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
Charter and just one one thing I want to
 
03:30:50.990 --> 03:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
say is this is something that we've done
 
03:30:52.710 --> 03:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
on some of the environmental commissions
 
03:30:55.750 --> 03:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
as well is uh you know periodically we
 
03:30:58.309 --> 03:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
do uh update when we actually renew some
 
03:31:00.510 --> 03:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
of the commissions we we update their
 
03:31:03.229 --> 03:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
Charters so this is not something that's
 
03:31:05.469 --> 03:31:05.479 align:start position:0%
irregular I I think it just sort of
 
03:31:09.030 --> 03:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
points out the the need to you know to
 
03:31:11.309 --> 03:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
to Bas basically the fact that a legis
 
03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
work is never done uh we need to keep
 
03:31:15.189 --> 03:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
looking at this stuff and keep finding
 
03:31:17.429 --> 03:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
ways to improve things keep finding new
 
03:31:20.070 --> 03:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
ways to get um additional input and make
 
03:31:22.550 --> 03:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
sure we're listening to the right people
 
03:31:24.070 --> 03:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
um so sounds like that's what we're
 
03:31:27.389 --> 03:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
doing yeah absolutely I think that um we
 
03:31:30.229 --> 03:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
need to use the tools at our disposal
 
03:31:32.429 --> 03:31:32.439 align:start position:0%
and having this group that's made up of
 
03:31:34.269 --> 03:31:34.279 align:start position:0%
all the subject matters experts come
 
03:31:35.990 --> 03:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
back to us with recommendations for
 
03:31:38.950 --> 03:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
legislation versus us in our own Silo
 
03:31:40.269 --> 03:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with something that'll
 
03:31:42.870 --> 03:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
fix it is much more efficient and um
 
03:31:44.790 --> 03:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
should have more weight also I wanted to
 
03:31:46.750 --> 03:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
add one more thing that I had neglected
 
03:31:49.070 --> 03:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
to mention as part of it um as part of
 
03:31:51.870 --> 03:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
the bill with regard to Bales um
 
03:31:55.790 --> 03:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
currently the um the district attorney
 
03:31:56.910 --> 03:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
not district attorney the County
 
03:31:59.550 --> 03:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
attorneys can appeal appeal a bail
 
03:32:01.830 --> 03:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
decision but they have to move for a
 
03:32:03.830 --> 03:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
revocation of bail and what we heard was
 
03:32:06.630 --> 03:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
it often takes sometimes weeks so in
 
03:32:08.510 --> 03:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
very limited cases where it's for
 
03:32:11.229 --> 03:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
dangerousness only the county attorney
 
03:32:12.990 --> 03:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
will be able to appeal a circuit court
 
03:32:16.950 --> 03:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
judge on release on dangerousness issues
 
03:32:19.389 --> 03:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
and that person will be held up to 48
 
03:32:21.830 --> 03:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
hours for a superior court hearing only
 
03:32:25.269 --> 03:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
on that issue um so it does give them a
 
03:32:28.429 --> 03:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
a fail safe if they extremely believe
 
03:32:30.110 --> 03:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
that a judge has made an error and it's
 
03:32:32.870 --> 03:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
dangerous to the society they can excuse
 
03:32:35.990 --> 03:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
no or judge um the circuit court judge
 
03:32:38.870 --> 03:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
makes it an error in the opinion of the
 
03:32:41.510 --> 03:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
of the uh County attorney on a very
 
03:32:43.510 --> 03:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
limited issue of dangerousness they can
 
03:32:46.030 --> 03:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
appeal and the person will be held for a
 
03:32:47.990 --> 03:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
maximum of 48 hours for the Superior
 
03:32:50.990 --> 03:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
Court to hold a hearing on the appeal um
 
03:32:52.830 --> 03:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
again it's narrow but it is it is
 
03:32:54.750 --> 03:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
something and it gives them at least the
 
03:32:56.269 --> 03:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make one more argument
 
03:32:58.389 --> 03:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
about dangerousness and I think that was
 
03:33:00.070 --> 03:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
everything we discussed um
 
03:33:01.510 --> 03:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative gather do you think can
 
03:33:02.830 --> 03:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
you recall anything else I might have
 
03:33:07.590 --> 03:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
missed no okay okay so any further
 
03:33:10.469 --> 03:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
discussion questions concerns before we
 
03:33:13.710 --> 03:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
send to the presses not the press the
 
03:33:16.750 --> 03:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
presses go ahead representative um thank
 
03:33:18.830 --> 03:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair are we still looking to do
 
03:33:20.750 --> 03:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
anything around text notifications of
 
03:33:20.760 --> 03:33:22.710 align:start position:0%
anything around text notifications of
Court

03:33:22.710 --> 03:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
Court
 
03:33:25.590 --> 03:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
hearings we uh I've spoken to the court
 
03:33:27.469 --> 03:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
and they are looking into that as part
 
03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
of the um the technology upgrade that
 
03:33:33.309 --> 03:33:33.319 align:start position:0%
we're proposing for them I I'm loed to
 
03:33:35.870 --> 03:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
mandate that they do that or how they do
 
03:33:40.309 --> 03:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
that because um it's complex and the it
 
03:33:41.590 --> 03:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
would be hard for us to tell them how to
 
03:33:42.910 --> 03:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
do it I don't want to get down into the
 
03:33:45.030 --> 03:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
weeds like that um it's just going to be
 
03:33:46.550 --> 03:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
part of the technology and they're very
 
03:33:48.910 --> 03:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
eager to do it um I had a conversation
 
03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
with the Chief Justice and he thought it
 
03:33:52.990 --> 03:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
was a great idea and he's seen it done
 
03:33:54.790 --> 03:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
in the pilot program before and thinks
 
03:33:58.110 --> 03:33:58.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's worthy of
 
03:33:58.120 --> 03:33:59.750 align:start position:0%
it's it's worthy of
pursuit

03:33:59.750 --> 03:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
pursuit
 
03:34:04.189 --> 03:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
okay everyone at this point raise your
 
03:34:05.590 --> 03:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
hand if you're in favor of everything I
 
03:34:09.670 --> 03:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
discussed so that I can send it to the
 
03:34:09.680 --> 03:34:11.950 align:start position:0%
discussed so that I can send it to the
OS

03:34:11.950 --> 03:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
OS
 
03:34:14.389 --> 03:34:14.399 align:start position:0%

03:34:15.910 --> 03:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
please watch your email over the weekend
