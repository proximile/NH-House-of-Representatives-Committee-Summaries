00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
adversely impact the service officer's

the requirements of RSA 126a colon 82

are currently being met without the need

the provisions of these two statutes
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
have not been implemented as there has
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
not been sufficient funding to carry out
 
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
their purpose
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
there is a caveat in the RSA
 
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
funding these Provisions will force
 
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
implementation which would prove to be
 
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
redundant and wasteful funding these
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
requirements would be throwing funds at
 
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 align:start position:0%
a problem that was solved by the
 
00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:22.099 align:start position:0%
creation of the Department of military
 
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.900 align:start position:0%
Affairs and Veterans Services in 2019
 
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
and Mr chairman I'm going to conclude my
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
Carson's uh testimony this morning and
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
add that uh
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
in addition to the comments that she
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
made some of the concrete things that
 
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
we're doing to make sure that that the
 
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
veterans of the state have access to
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
care and and uh uh access to all types
 
00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:56.820 align:start position:0%
of care in those categories that she
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned that in the last biennium
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
there was a 1.5 million dollar
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
appropriation uh
 
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
in hb2 to get after these things
 
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
specifically so without The Navigators
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
right to just to implement some programs
 
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
in that we we have two contracts one
 
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
with Easter Seals and one with the
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
partnership for public health both of
 
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
those contracts are focusing on
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
eliminating uh social isolation and
 
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
issues that are associated with veterans
 
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
with with military service those
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
programs have been implemented are are
 
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
and we're making great Headway on on in
 
00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
both of those program programs
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
also we've uh instituted uh some
 
00:09:43.329 --> 00:09:43.339 align:start position:0%
provider focused training uh
 
00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
specifically to help identify service
 
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:47.220 align:start position:0%
members veterans and their families
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
across the state so that they can get
 
00:09:51.889 --> 00:09:51.899 align:start position:0%
access to the resources and care that
 
00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:53.459 align:start position:0%
they would that they have earned through
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
their veteran service
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
so there's a 10 a 10 part video series
 
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
that we have on our websites that really
 
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
focuses on what we call the ask the
 
00:10:05.449 --> 00:10:05.459 align:start position:0%
question Campaign which is just helping
 
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%
providers identify if somebody has
 
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
served and then being able to provide
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
culturally competent care for them right
 
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
we don't you don't necessarily have had
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
to serve to provide good care to
 
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
Veterans but you do need to understand
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
them right I use the allegory of people
 
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
who are victims of sexual trauma you
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
don't have to have been the victim of
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
sexual trauma to be able to provide
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
competent care but you do need to
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
understand some of the culture and and
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
Things That Go On uh in the military so
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
you can provide that care additionally
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
we are entering into a marketing
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
contract that will focus on providers
 
00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:44.459 align:start position:0%
and helping providers understand what
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
resources there are available for
 
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
veterans so this this requirement there
 
00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:52.019 align:start position:0%
for to have the veterans service
 
00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:53.509 align:start position:0%
for to have the veterans service
officers

00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
go outside of what is their trained
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
Comfort work to provide navigation
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
through Social Service provision you
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
know it's just it's not necessary and
 
00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:05.459 align:start position:0%
would also detract from their ability to
 
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
be able to connect veterans with the
 
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
benefits the other benefits they've
 
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
earned through their service right so
 
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
our veteran service officers in the
 
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
division of veterans Service uh division
 
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
of better Services there are seven of
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
them uh they bring in about 65 million
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
dollars a year in benefits to the
 
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
veterans of New Hampshire so we don't
 
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
want to take away from that we want them
 
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
focused on getting them connected to the
 
00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:29.579 align:start position:0%
benefits and that the the experts in
 
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
Social Work continue to be able to
 
00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:34.019 align:start position:0%
provide those other services good warm
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
handoffs good good close collaboration
 
00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:39.860 align:start position:0%
with uh with Wendy and her team at HHS
 
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
good close coordination with the
 
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers and
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
other service providers across the state
 
00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:47.459 align:start position:0%
and let the veteran service officers
 
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
continue to do their work so in some
 
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
I'll conclude my my statements by saying
 
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:54.500 align:start position:0%
you know this this this
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
bill that was passed that created the
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
this this idea of healthcare Navigators
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's really unnecessary and I you
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
know kind of tongue-in-cheek call it a
 
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
you know a uh a solution looking for a
 
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
problem to solve right so really what we
 
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
want to do here today is just clean up
 
00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
the statutes let us continue to operate
 
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
the way we are not create any other
 
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
resource burden on the state and
 
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
continue to provide great services to
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
our veterans and I'll let Wendy make a
 
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
statement and I'll answer any questions
 
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:28.860 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
my questions from committee members
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and thank you
 
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm wondering if
 
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
you're experiencing or what you're
 
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
experiencing in the way of delays of
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
getting services to people we've we've
 
00:16:19.569 --> 00:16:19.579 align:start position:0%
been hearing a lot about
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
the concerns brought on by lack of
 
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
Health Care Workforce and I'm wondering
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
if there are delays in getting care for
 
00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:32.459 align:start position:0%
veterans that might be resultant on that
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
particularly as you're trying to make
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
these fairly intricate connections
 
00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:41.339 align:start position:0%
so I think I think I would answer that
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative I think that the best way
 
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
to answer that is the veteran population
 
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh capacity for care is no
 
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
different than the population as as at
 
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
large so if they're if you're
 
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
experiencing issues getting care in the
 
00:16:59.090 --> 00:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
community you want to see a cardiologist
 
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
or you want to see a mental health
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
professional those carry over I think
 
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
probably very very similarly in the
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
veteran Community as well so everybody
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
faces that one of the things we're very
 
00:17:12.289 --> 00:17:12.299 align:start position:0%
careful about is trying not to you're
 
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
trying not to create a new system just
 
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
for veterans use you know leverage the
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
existing systems to get after that uh to
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
get after you know the problems that we
 
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
have but in the veteran Community there
 
00:17:24.289 --> 00:17:24.299 align:start position:0%
are other things that are available to
 
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
them that are not available to the to
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
the community at large so we we have uh
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
the uh the vet centers there are two vet
 
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
centers in the state one up in uh in
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
Berlin and one in Hooksett that they
 
00:17:39.409 --> 00:17:39.419 align:start position:0%
have very specific uh constituencies
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
generally uh PTSD combat related trauma
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
and military sexual trauma but they
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
provide another resource that wouldn't
 
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
necessarily be available to the public
 
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
so in those instances the care you would
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
access to care would be easier and
 
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
faster than it would be
 
00:17:59.210 --> 00:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
but I you know all in all I think the
 
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
best answer I can give you is it's no
 
00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:03.299 align:start position:0%
different for you know Joe public than
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
it is for Joe veteran
 
00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:09.419 align:start position:0%
follow-up sure thank you Mr chair
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
um is there not a presence in Keene
 
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.130 align:start position:0%
um is there not a presence in Keene
anymore

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
there is uh not not the there's prob
 
00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:18.299 align:start position:0%
there is presence in Keen for uh
 
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
veterans service I'm sure community
 
00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
health centers and some other things
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
there but in terms of the VA I'm there
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
may be a community-based out patient
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
Clinic there wasn't there was a and I
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
thought the last time I drove by there
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
there are people behind you nodding
 
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
their heads so I mean I just wanted to
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
be sure that was still there but
 
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
specific the vet centers are specific to
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
mental health PTSD and military sexual
 
00:18:42.169 --> 00:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
trauma and combat trauma that's why I
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned those two okay so it's a
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
separate it's that's a it's a treatment
 
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
area it's yes yes gotcha thank you very
 
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
much representative Murphy did you have
 
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
your hand up earlier okay representative
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
um just to be polite we have a really
 
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
complicated siled fragmented Health Care
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
system that I don't think serves people
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
with complex physical mental
 
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
disabilities very well
 
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
um I don't think I'm
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
saying anything insightful with that
 
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
what I was excited about this is what
 
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
we're trying to find in our Health Care
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
system is individuals that'll help
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
people with complex disabilities
 
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
navigate an incredibly complicated
 
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.470 align:start position:0%
navigate an incredibly complicated
system

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
I really thought that this was a good
 
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
program to do that and might be an
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
inspiring way to help our Health Care
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
system as a whole accomplish that
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
problem what I'm wondering is you're
 
00:19:39.529 --> 00:19:39.539 align:start position:0%
telling me that this is not necessary
 
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
but what I'm not necessarily hearing is
 
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
how is the systems that exist now
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
helping me isn't veteran with a complex
 
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
mental and physical disability to
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
navigate the complexity of this system
 
00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:54.059 align:start position:0%
so I
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
the first thing I want to say is the way
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
this bill was written is not the answer
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
so that that's the first thing I'm going
 
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
to say it's like well it looks good on
 
00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:03.419 align:start position:0%
its outset the way that this was going
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
to be implemented was not going to solve
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
the problem right it's not going to get
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
to answer the question that you just
 
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
asked I think I think what we're doing
 
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
now in partnership with DHHS is not
 
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
creating a new system for veterans but
 
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
leveraging the system that we have in
 
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
the state and making that a an entryway
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
into those systems as we go one of the
 
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
contracts that I that I mentioned that
 
00:20:30.289 --> 00:20:30.299 align:start position:0%
we have with uh you know based on that
 
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
1.5 million dollar funding is with
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
partnership for public health and in The
 
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region the Lakes Region veteran
 
00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
Coalition has established a network
 
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
specific to Veterans to be able to have
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
them get access to those complex care
 
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
all those co-occurring morbidities that
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
people have you know if they have a PTSD
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
and now they have substance abuse
 
00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
associated with that suicidal ideation
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
but not only that but they're diabetic
 
00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
and they need to you know they need good
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
case work to to be able to get after
 
00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
that the coalitions that the Lakes
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
Region veteran Coalition is the model by
 
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
which one of these contracts is going
 
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
out around the state regionally and
 
00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
creating more and more of these of these
 
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
networks so I that's the way to really
 
00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
get after it right so that's the first
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
thing the second piece is we have to be
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
able to tell people what resources are
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
available to them right so the marketing
 
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
piece of this is is it's absolutely
 
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
critical right so we're we're we are
 
00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
about about ready to go to GNC with the
 
00:21:33.049 --> 00:21:33.059 align:start position:0%
marketing contract and that marketing
 
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
contract is going to Target providers
 
00:21:36.049 --> 00:21:36.059 align:start position:0%
with the resources that might be
 
00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
available to them it's amazing to me
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
what people don't know like if like YP
 
00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
people are on Medicaid when they're
 
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
eligible for VA benefits and how how
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
could we alleviate the stress on the
 
00:21:48.649 --> 00:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
Medicaid system if we could just get
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
them into the VA system which already
 
00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:52.860 align:start position:0%
provides culturally competent care
 
00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the ways that I
 
00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
would that would offer to you that that
 
00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
that's happening but the way this law
 
00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
was written it takes a person who's
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for helping connect a
 
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
service-connected medical condition to a
 
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
VA benef claim benefit so that you can
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
get compensation and pen and then turn
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
them into a social worker and that's
 
00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
just to my way of thinking that's the
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
wrong idea so I've answered your
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
question I think but I've also said you
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
know the healthcare Navigator is really
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
not the right way to do it the way it's
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
written in this in this statute
 
00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
see no other questions okay thank you
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time thank
 
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:42.529 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time thank
you

00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:42.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is David Kenney
 
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
sure and we're wondering what sfax
 
00:22:59.450 --> 00:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman finally a question
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
I can answer
 
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.810 align:start position:0%
I can answer
um

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:04.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
there we go uh thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
svac stands for the state veterans
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
advisory committee uh we were formed in
 
00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
uh 2001
 
00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:18.059 align:start position:0%
um basically we were a follow-on to an
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
original committee that was in the 90s
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
that pretty much had the same Mission so
 
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
we are comprised right now about 20
 
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
veterans service organizations in the
 
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:30.419 align:start position:0%
State uh many of you may be familiar
 
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
with the American Legion VFW all sit at
 
00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
our table the the nature of svac quite
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
frankly is we meet once a month during
 
00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
the legislative session and our job is
 
00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:46.340 align:start position:0%
to basically discuss these legislations
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
and make sure that they're in the right
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
vein for supporting veterans here in the
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire it also provides
 
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
a communication conduit
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
from the legislature back to these
 
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
organizations as well so in in our
 
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
discussions during these meetings we
 
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
have the ability to take information
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
that is provided to us by various
 
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
organizations uh various entities that
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
come to the state that want to establish
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
a new Services here for veterans and
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
bring that back to the organization so
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
that we can essentially distribute that
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
information as widely as possible to all
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
of the state groups and the state
 
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.289 align:start position:0%
of the state groups and the state
organizations

00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:26.299 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
to essentially illustrate Warren's
 
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
earlier point was to get the information
 
00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:34.820 align:start position:0%
out and to try to be really really
 
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
focused on marketing if you will as much
 
00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
of that information as possible to
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
Veterans we have a very diverse
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
population here in the state we have a
 
00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:45.380 align:start position:0%
lot of Young Veterans that are very
 
00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:48.299 align:start position:0%
technology so for them getting
 
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
information off the web is very easy but
 
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
we also have an aging population in this
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
state a lot of Vietnam veterans Korean
 
00:24:57.649 --> 00:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
veterans who not as a Droid on
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
technology and so for them we have to
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
reach out to them the more traditional
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
ways and having that ability to go in
 
00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:06.500 align:start position:0%
that diverse Direction
 
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
hopefully gives us the ability to
 
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
connect as much as possible
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
um as far as the bill here this morning
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
uh the one Beauty about testifying after
 
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
the experts is that they cut through
 
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
about three quarters of the things you
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
were going to say
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
so I would simply say that we did take
 
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
this up with uh the last s back and it
 
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
was unanimously voted that we were we
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
would like to support this bill we do
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
think that it's a common sense approach
 
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
as illustrated by the testimony earlier
 
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
and we are confident that by doing so it
 
00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:43.340 align:start position:0%
will not negate any services
 
00:25:45.769 --> 00:25:45.779 align:start position:0%
from the veteran Community here in the
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
um we're in close contact with Warren's
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
office obviously as well as some of the
 
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
other organizations around the state
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
including the VA
 
00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:57.299 align:start position:0%
um so we're we're constantly informed
 
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
about all the changes that are being
 
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
made with Community community-based Care
 
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
with the VA and with dmapps and and
 
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
truthfully we're we're very satisfied
 
00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:09.539 align:start position:0%
with the direction that things are going
 
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
and uh and we'd certainly like to
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
continue that so we really appreciate
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
your listening and I don't open to any
 
00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:18.539 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you
 
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
representative McKay
 
00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:24.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
can you tell me if
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
the there's a 10-year mental health plan
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
which I'm not sure if that pertains to
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
the kind of services that you're talking
 
00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.730 align:start position:0%
the kind of services that you're talking
about

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:39.740 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
but that out of the veterans being
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
offered any kind of
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
mental health care or health care that
 
00:26:50.049 --> 00:26:50.059 align:start position:0%
anybody else is
 
00:26:50.059 --> 00:26:51.669 align:start position:0%
anybody else is
also

00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
provided for
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for the
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
question um truthfully that's not my
 
00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
area of expertise but I can tell you
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
what I do know
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you that the VA
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
specifically does have an offer mental
 
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
health care as well as our
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
community-based services to Warren's
 
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
Point earlier the one thing that's the
 
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
one aspect of mental health care for the
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
veteran Community is that there is some
 
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
uniqueness to it in the sense that the
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
veterans are dealing with
 
00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:24.419 align:start position:0%
mental problems that are not necessarily
 
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
part of the general populace and so
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
having that ability or having that kind
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
of mental health provider if you will
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
that understands that culture and
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
understands those kinds of issues are
 
00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299 align:start position:0%
crucially important so in addition to
 
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
what the VA is providing we're also
 
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
reaching out to you know community-based
 
00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
providers that also understand the
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
culture and as mentioned earlier the ask
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
the question campaign is also when
 
00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.510 align:start position:0%
the question campaign is also when
another

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
prong to that that approach if you will
 
00:27:59.330 --> 00:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
where providers will be trained or on
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
the actual military culture so they too
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
can provide services to the military and
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
essentially as we as we say we they can
 
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
talk the talk they understand the
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
language and they understand you know
 
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
the culture and that's that's the beauty
 
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
of it so
 
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
um the short answer is is that those are
 
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
ever expanding services and I think the
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
VA and community base right now is
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
addressing those issues a follow-up
 
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.990 align:start position:0%
addressing those issues a follow-up
follow-up

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
is that any different from the kind of
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
care that police would get or firemen
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
would get
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
I would say yes and no I mean as far as
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
the the trauma that you might address in
 
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
those issues absolutely I would say that
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
the type of care might be similar but I
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
think when you're looking at police fire
 
00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
and Military there are three distinct
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
cultures too even though the trauma that
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
they experience might be similar but
 
00:28:57.169 --> 00:28:57.179 align:start position:0%
they're three distinct cultures Warren
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
Perry may have some comment on that as
 
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
well he may be able to illustrate
 
00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.250 align:start position:0%
well he may be able to illustrate
further

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:03.260 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
again Warren Perry from partner military
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
Affairs American Services regarding your
 
00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
first question representative McKay the
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
the department of military Affairs and
 
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:13.860 align:start position:0%
veteran services was a party to
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
development of the 10-year mental health
 
00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:18.299 align:start position:0%
plan so we we had input to that with
 
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:22.140 align:start position:0%
regard to uh with regard to the similar
 
00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
the similarities between paramilitary
 
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
organizations police and fire and and
 
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
the military the trauma can be the same
 
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
just the circumstances are different and
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
so I I would think that the the mental
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
health professionals in that regard
 
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
would be able to meet those those people
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
where they are and provide the
 
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
appropriate service
 
00:29:42.889 --> 00:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
um representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you taking my question
 
00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.210 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you taking my question
um

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
as you know in White River there's a
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
fairly large you know VA Medical Center
 
00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
um and it in the VA system is really
 
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
well connected you know electronically
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
and otherwise and I'm wondering what if
 
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
any is there an impact on the veterans
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
that are living in New Hampshire that
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
receive their care in White River or
 
00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
Boston where we used to refer to a lot
 
00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
if there's any you know
 
00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
um uh impact on that ability
 
00:30:18.289 --> 00:30:18.299 align:start position:0%
I would say that uh you know the
 
00:30:21.169 --> 00:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
first of all the White River Junction
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
facility right now is headed up by Dr
 
00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:24.740 align:start position:0%
Brent Rush
 
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:28.580 align:start position:0%
Brett's experience is psychology
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
so you know mental health is kind of his
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
his wheelhouse
 
00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
um and I can tell you that the
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
facilities at White River Junction have
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
been a great augment for us here in that
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
when we need to provide Mental Health
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
Services that for example we've had
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
challenges here in the state with with
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
providing beds right mental health beds
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
and so in circumstances like that where
 
00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
we need to get someone into a scenario
 
00:31:00.289 --> 00:31:00.299 align:start position:0%
where they're in a closed environment
 
00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:03.299 align:start position:0%
where they can get Direct Care White
 
00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:06.059 align:start position:0%
River Junction has been at the fore and
 
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
being able to do those types of things
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
and their and they're staffed to handle
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
those issues could we make improvements
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
in that area I think so and I think the
 
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:16.850 align:start position:0%
in that area I think so and I think the
the

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
um the discussion right now and the
 
00:31:20.889 --> 00:31:20.899 align:start position:0%
public forum certainly indicates that
 
00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
but I think as far as the VA is
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
concerned we're addressing those issues
 
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
as best we can but I think also
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester is looking at at ways in
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
which they can do that also in addition
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
to providing the mental health care at
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
the community level we'd like to try to
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
address those issues as early as we can
 
00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539 align:start position:0%
so when a veteran presents themselves
 
00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
with a particular you know challenge we
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
try to get them into the appropriate
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
care as quickly as possible so White
 
00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:52.740 align:start position:0%
River is really kind of a another tool
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
in that toolbox if you will and it's an
 
00:31:57.169 --> 00:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
excellent facility I've been over there
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
several times and it's it's an awesome
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
facility thank you thank you
 
00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:06.889 --> 00:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
saying no other questions okay thank you
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.529 --> 00:32:12.539 align:start position:0%
I have no uh what else signed up to
 
00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:15.539 align:start position:0%
testify on Senate Bill 174 does anyone
 
00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
else wish to testify representative
 
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.669 align:start position:0%
else wish to testify representative
Weber

00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering Mr chairman if this
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
might not be a bill that is uh of the
 
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:27.539 align:start position:0%
sort that we could just go immediately
 
00:32:30.169 --> 00:32:30.179 align:start position:0%
into executive session I I don't know if
 
00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
there are other members of the committee
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
who want I don't want to rush things if
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
people feel they need to take more time
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
with it but it seems to me that this one
 
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
might be relatively clear and we could
 
00:32:42.889 --> 00:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
exec it immediately I have no objection
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any objections to
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
okay well why don't we go ahead and do
 
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
some point of order um so I'm I'm
 
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
assuming uh that we don't have to notice
 
00:32:57.889 --> 00:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
this separately if we're exacting it
 
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:00.059 align:start position:0%
together with the hearing
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
rule 44 I believe it is C says executive
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
sessions may also be held without
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
further notice if held immediately after
 
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
the close of a duly noticed public
 
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
hearing with the concurrence of the
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
chair and ranking member perfect okay I
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure we're doing
 
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
session I'd be glad to make a motion
 
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
okay yes let's do that then let's
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
proceed to an executive session on
 
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:35.220 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 174 representative Weber uh
 
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I would move on to pass on
 
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 174. I don't think I need to
 
00:33:42.649 --> 00:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
recap the testimony that was given but
 
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
it was unanimous in One Direction and
 
00:33:48.889 --> 00:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like things are going well
 
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
and we shouldn't mess with it so we need
 
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
to clean up the things that need to be
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
cleaned up to allow them to continue to
 
00:33:57.169 --> 00:33:57.179 align:start position:0%

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you I was
 
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for that suggestion I will get
 
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
you a
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
procedural question are our rules any
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
different than the senates
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
yes entirely and the reason I ask is all
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
my bills got exact a minute we did them
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
well and the Senate does it that way but
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
I will say that we operate under Mason's
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
rules of procedure and the Senate
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
operates under Roberts and then we all
 
00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
have our own customs and ways of doing
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
things so uh this is in the nature of a
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
senate proceeding but it's it's a new
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
formulation to let us get bills like
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
this going
 
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
thanks okay thank you
 
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.030 align:start position:0%
thanks okay thank you
okay

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:08.329 --> 00:36:08.339 align:start position:0%
um having moved on and
 
00:36:11.329 --> 00:36:11.339 align:start position:0%
exact uh and heard all testimony for
 
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 174. uh let us now proceed
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
to Senate bill 30.
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
um Senator Whitley is the prime sponsor
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh welcome senator
 
00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:26.030 align:start position:0%
uh welcome senator
foreign

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good morning members
 
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
of the committee it's good to be back in
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
the house thank you for welcoming me for
 
00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Becky Whitley and
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
I'm honored to serve New Hampshire
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
Senate District 15 which includes the
 
00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
wonderful communities of Beau Concord
 
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
Penacook and Hopkinton
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
so today I'm here to introduce Senate
 
00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:47.780 align:start position:0%
bill 30. this is a housekeeping bill
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
that was requested by the New Hampshire
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
Council of Developmental Disabilities
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
for a little background the council is a
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
federally funded state agency that
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
promotes self-determination integration
 
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
and inclusion for New Hampshire citizens
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
with developmental disabilities
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
so because it is a a sort of federal
 
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
state uh combination the council is
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
required uh has a certain amount of
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
requirements from the federal government
 
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
through federal regulations and through
 
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
state government so per federal law the
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
council is made up of at least 60
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
percent people with developmental
 
00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
disabilities or their Guardians so the
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is to update their
 
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
state statute their RSA in alignment
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
with their other Federal requirements
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
so a little more detail into that the
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
council is required by federal law to
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
set aside nine seats for various state
 
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
agencies including their Federal
 
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.250 align:start position:0%
agencies including their Federal
partners

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
partners
 
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
like the institute on disability the
 
00:37:50.089 --> 00:37:50.099 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center
 
00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
um as well as the Department of
 
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
Education DHHS and other disability
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
adjacent organizations so the current
 
00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
wording under the council's membership
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
terms state that no more than they may
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
have no more than 21 members so I think
 
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
changing the wording to at least 21 will
 
00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
bring bring them into compliance with
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
their Federal mandate for membership and
 
00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
there is a representative from the
 
00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:13.740 align:start position:0%
council who can expand on that further
 
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
so alongside that change the council is
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
also requesting removal of the language
 
00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:20.579 align:start position:0%
stating vacancies will be filled for the
 
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
expired term because they feel that it
 
00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
has caused some fill seats vacated
 
00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
midterm as to when their terms end I'm
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions but we'll
 
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.140 align:start position:0%
defer more technical questions to the
 
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
operations of the council and to their
 
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements to the staff from
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
the DD Council behind me so thank you
 
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
for your time and I'm happy to take any
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
questions questions for Senator Whitley
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
yes representative Weber
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for bringing us
 
00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:47.220 align:start position:0%
the bill Senator
 
00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.250 align:start position:0%
the bill Senator
um

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:48.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
so what if we remove that
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
one sentence my question becomes
 
00:38:59.690 --> 00:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
does that mean that when there is a
 
00:39:01.849 --> 00:39:01.859 align:start position:0%
vacancy somebody simply gets appointed
 
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
for a full term starting at at the date
 
00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
of the week of their appointment
 
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
that that's a good question I'm going to
 
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
defer that to sort of what happens now
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
and how they believe that language will
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
sort of fix that problem if that's okay
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am thank you
 
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
I see Newton thank you thank you Mr

also signed up to speak is is Adora

the record my name is Isadora Rodriguez
 
00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
legendre I serve as the executive
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
director at the New Hampshire Council on
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities the DD
 
00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
council is dedicated to dignity
 
00:39:58.849 --> 00:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
full rights of citizenship cultural
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
diversity equal opportunities and full
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
participation for all New Hampshire
 
00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:04.740 align:start position:0%
citizens with intellectual and
 
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities
 
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
as Senator Whitley stated this is a
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill intended to align our
 
00:40:19.329 --> 00:40:19.339 align:start position:0%
state statute RSA 19j with our federal
 
00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
requirements we are required to have
 
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
nine separate entities
 
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
under that law and so to maintain our 60
 
00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
percent of individuals and Guardians
 
00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
with lived experience of Developmental
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
Disabilities we need to add more seats
 
00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
than 21 right it's basic math we need
 
00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
about two-thirds of our members having
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
lived experience of just developmental
 
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
disability so with nine agency seats
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
that leaves you know about 18 member
 
00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:58.740 align:start position:0%
seats to be be in compliance so merely
 
00:40:58.740 --> 00:40:59.950 align:start position:0%
seats to be be in compliance so merely
changing

00:40:59.950 --> 00:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
changing
 
00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:03.380 align:start position:0%
the at the
 
00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
verbiage to say at least from up to will
 
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:12.839 align:start position:0%
help with that in regards to the member
 
00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
terms so we do have bylaws and our
 
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
bylaws have been updated to simplify the
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
term limits for members who leave
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
midterm or members who are added to the
 
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
council when someone leaves
 
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
and how we do that now is members are
 
00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:37.859 align:start position:0%
seated for three-year terms they are
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial appointments and so if
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
someone leaves the council either you
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
know one year in or two years in before
 
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
their term has expired we do identify a
 
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
new member to fill that seat and
 
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
represent that vacancy and we have that
 
00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:57.650 align:start position:0%
represent that vacancy and we have that
person

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:57.660 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
fill the rest of the year we operate on
 
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
a federal fiscal year so we have their
 
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
official term begin on October 1st to be
 
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
consistent with a three-year term under
 
00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:14.579 align:start position:0%
a federal fiscal year and that has
 
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
eliminated a lot of confusion because we
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
used to have to track exactly which
 
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
month someone left and how much was left
 
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
in their unexpired term and this really
 
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
just is it's so much easier to keep
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
track of and people know when their
 
00:42:32.089 --> 00:42:32.099 align:start position:0%
start date is and when their end date is
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
and then they are eligible to reapply
 
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
for a second three-year term
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
um and that it creates also an easiness
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
to reapply to the governor's office when
 
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
we know that term is expiring around
 
00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.710 align:start position:0%
we know that term is expiring around
September

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
September
 
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
I could go on and on about the DD
 
00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
Council I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
specifically about the legislation
 
00:42:59.569 --> 00:42:59.579 align:start position:0%
before you
 
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
um and if there's anything I haven't
 
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
answered please let me know
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Shapiro thank
 
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for coming
 
00:43:11.809 --> 00:43:11.819 align:start position:0%
again and taking your questions when we
 
00:43:15.609 --> 00:43:15.619 align:start position:0%
heard a bill earlier about the council
 
00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
House Bill 238 maybe I'm comparing
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
apples to oranges here so I'm sure you
 
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
can clarify this but
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
um it was referenced in 171 a33 that 51
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
percent of the members of the council
 
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
shall be people with
 
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
um developmental disabilities and now
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
we're hearing 60 percent so
 
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:42.839 align:start position:0%
of those different categories there are
 
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
different councils one is the
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
developmental Services quality Council
 
00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:50.540 align:start position:0%
which is the one which is the one under
 
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
171 a it is a separate Council that is
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
made up of a lot of stakeholders we have
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
a c on that Council we also see a person
 
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
with a disability a direct support
 
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
professional and an enhanced family care
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
provider to that Council because those
 
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:10.140 align:start position:0%
are important voices to have one
 
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
considering quality of Services Under
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
Services for people with developmental
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities but we are a different
 
00:44:22.849 --> 00:44:22.859 align:start position:0%
Council we operate under the federal act
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
known as the DD act it's the
 
00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities Bill of
 
00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:29.819 align:start position:0%

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:45:07.609 --> 00:45:07.619 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
at least not more than 21 conflicts with
 
00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:16.700 align:start position:0%
a requirement
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
to have at least 60 percent
 
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
of certain demographic and then with
 
00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:24.849 align:start position:0%
of certain demographic and then with
Federal

00:45:24.849 --> 00:45:24.859 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:28.140 align:start position:0%
requirement to have at least nine
 
00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
representatives from certain
 
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
organizations so wouldn't Federal
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
requirement just override any conflict
 
00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
that exists
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
uh so to answer your question yes thank
 
00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:46.940 align:start position:0%
you for that question yes the federal
 
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh law would Trump the state law in this
 
00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
particular case however however we feel
 
00:45:56.569 --> 00:45:56.579 align:start position:0%
that it's important to align these two
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
so that the state mirrors what the
 
00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
federal requirement is so that we're not
 
00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
having to make those decisions and it
 
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:05.390 align:start position:0%
having to make those decisions and it
makes

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
makes
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
sense for the state law to say exactly
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
how the council should be seated in
 
00:46:19.849 --> 00:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
order for not to be confusion right
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
follow what uh follow up
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
in your
 
00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.849 align:start position:0%
in your
uh

00:46:27.849 --> 00:46:27.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
consequences of breaking state law of
 
00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:34.460 align:start position:0%
breaking these requirements of having
 
00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:38.300 align:start position:0%
non-representatives in federal law
 
00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:39.829 align:start position:0%
non-representatives in federal law
so

00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
um we are 100 federally funded so there
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
is a consequence for us not adhering to
 
00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
the federal law are potentially our
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
funding could be at risk we have
 
00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
received this lap on the wrist
 
00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
um previously when I first started at
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
the council there were seven agency
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
seats one individual was holding the
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
seat for the required
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
um older Americans act and title V and
 
00:47:11.089 --> 00:47:11.099 align:start position:0%
Title IX of the Social Security Act
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
which are maternal and child health and
 
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
then um Social Security benefits for
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities and so their uh
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
response to that makeup was that you
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
should really have uh individual
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
entities that have the expertise to help
 
00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
inform your decisions and your
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
priorities that uh know about those
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
particular areas of those laws that
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
that's why they named them in the
 
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:41.720 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
00:47:44.349 --> 00:47:44.359 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
consequences of
 
00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
not being aligned with the state law we
 
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
have more than 21 members now so I
 
00:47:55.089 --> 00:47:55.099 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten any knocks on my door
 
00:47:57.849 --> 00:47:57.859 align:start position:0%
saying you can't add more people
 
00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:01.140 align:start position:0%
because you've reached your limit at the
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
state level especially when we explain
 
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
that the state law is not consistent
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
with our federal requirement
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
and it's the voices of the people with
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities that should be most present
 
00:48:16.849 --> 00:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
in our work
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
other questions uh representative Weber
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you again
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
and is it
 
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:25.490 align:start position:0%
and is it
um

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
my calculation is that if you had 22.5
 
00:48:34.329 --> 00:48:34.339 align:start position:0%
people you would be okay with the
 
00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
math but not with the number of persons
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
so it am I correct in thinking that we
 
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily need to change it to
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
23 because there may be adjustments down
 
00:48:49.849 --> 00:48:49.859 align:start position:0%
the road in those other things but if we
 
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
just say no less than 21 then the state
 
00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
and the federal can both be complied
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
with at the same time and then
 
00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
presumably your your bylaws which sound
 
00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
like they're relatively robust at this
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
point can take care of any adjustments
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
that need to be made
 
00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.530 align:start position:0%
that need to be made
exactly

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make it as simple as
 
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
possible and instead of changing our
 
00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:17.940 align:start position:0%
state law to say at least 23 which would
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
make the math work we just decided to
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
change the phrase at least
 
00:49:24.839 --> 00:49:25.609 align:start position:0%
change the phrase at least
um

00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
it aligns perfectly with the federal
 
00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
requirements that way okay thank you
 
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
yes representative McKay
 
00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I notice you're a
 
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
social worker yeah which is fine
 
00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
that's a at a previous meeting
 
00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
it was very uh painful to sit here
 
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
to feel the tension or stress
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
between various components that are
 
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
dealing with the DD population and have
 
00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:06.380 align:start position:0%
been for years there have been
 
00:50:08.809 --> 00:50:08.819 align:start position:0%
long-standing problems
 
00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:13.220 align:start position:0%
so that I think our Senator is trying to
 
00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:18.859 align:start position:0%
open up a more positive communication
 
00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
that seems to be missing at times I was
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
very startled by the amount of pain that
 
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
seemed to be exhibited I don't know if
 
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
you had the same experience
 
00:50:35.569 --> 00:50:35.579 align:start position:0%
yes there is a lot of tension especially
 
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
around some of the systems change work
 
00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
um especially for people with
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
intellectual and developmental
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities in their families because
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
there's no way for them to know how
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
that's going to impact their services
 
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
and so there's always going to be
 
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
concerns about unknowns and that creates
 
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of tension and a lot of kind of
 
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
wanting to hang on to how things are
 
00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
done because at least you know what to
 
00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
expect right so that's a that's a lot
 
00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
some of that tension can be whittled
 
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
down to that but I I think
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
we're always going to have differences
 
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
as far as systems go that serve large
 
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
amounts of people it's never going to be
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
exactly perfect for every single
 
00:51:26.809 --> 00:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
individual and and you know we have to
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
kind of come to terms with that and do
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
the best we can and that's why the
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
councils like the quality Council are so
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
important because they're made up of
 
00:51:38.329 --> 00:51:38.339 align:start position:0%
stakeholder groups that can kind of
 
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
speak to the different issues that
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
people are experiencing on the ground
 
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
so we're just gonna have to continue to
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
try and meet somewhere in the middle as
 
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
best we can
 
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:57.370 --> 00:51:57.380 align:start position:0%
okay other questions
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.309 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
chair

00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
one of the things that has been raised
 
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
in the past with some councils in some
 
00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
boards and commissions
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
compliance to 91a requires a physical
 
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:13.559 align:start position:0%
Quorum and given the fact that many of
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
your constituents on the council may
 
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
have a challenge physically going to a
 
00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:20.390 align:start position:0%
have a challenge physically going to a
place

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
is there any thoughts on trying to
 
00:52:26.329 --> 00:52:26.339 align:start position:0%
minimize that or what I'm trying to do
 
00:52:26.339 --> 00:52:27.049 align:start position:0%
minimize that or what I'm trying to do
is

00:52:27.049 --> 00:52:27.059 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:52:29.569 --> 00:52:29.579 align:start position:0%
could we possibly expand it so we have
 
00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:31.859 align:start position:0%
more opportunity for people to
 
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
participate without having to go through
 
00:52:35.089 --> 00:52:35.099 align:start position:0%
the traveling requirements particularly
 
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
during the winter time
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so much for that question
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
I I can say it has made it easier for
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
people to participate virtually
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
over the last few years we recently
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
um went from meeting every other month
 
00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
to meeting quarterly which cuts down on
 
00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
the number of meetings
 
00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:01.430 align:start position:0%
the number of meetings
um

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
we took a page out of the governor's
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
Commission on disability and wrote into
 
00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:10.460 align:start position:0%
our bylaws that someone who needs an ADA
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
accommodation for meeting attendance
 
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
would be counted as in person as long as
 
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
they have a disability
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
and that's it stated that that's the
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
reason they cannot attend
 
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
um we uh we did pretty well with
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
attendance at our last meeting a lot of
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
our agency seats are in the Concord area
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
which helps a lot
 
00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:39.059 align:start position:0%
um and then some of our community
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
members also
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
um can we are able to reimburse them for
 
00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:46.329 align:start position:0%
um can we are able to reimburse them for
transportation

00:53:46.329 --> 00:53:46.339 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
one of them you know got we got a
 
00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:53.339 align:start position:0%
um a non-emergency transport for them to
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
come from the Portsmouth area so we we
 
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
make it work as best we can there are
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
times like in January very it was almost
 
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
100 percent virtual attendance because
 
00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
the weather was bad and there were a lot
 
00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
of circumstances however
 
00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
um we're in our minutes for that meeting
 
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
we did cite that there continued to be a
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
federal emergency and that due to
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
circumstances with transportation that
 
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
what we did was just have voice votes
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
for anything that needed to be voted on
 
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
we do the best we can
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
follow up follow-up and so with this
 
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing will be clear at this
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
point in time it's not necessary to try
 
00:54:44.569 --> 00:54:44.579 align:start position:0%
to modify 91a to try to accommodate the
 
00:54:44.579 --> 00:54:45.530 align:start position:0%
to modify 91a to try to accommodate the
council

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
I thank you for that follow-up question
 
00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:52.140 align:start position:0%
I would not say that that's the case I
 
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
would say that having this anxiety of
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
trying to meet in person Quorum when you
 
00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
have an organization like ours that's
 
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
where 60 of our membership is comprised
 
00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:07.980 align:start position:0%
of individuals with lived experience of
 
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
intellectual and developmental
 
00:55:12.049 --> 00:55:12.059 align:start position:0%
disabilities who don't drive who may not
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
have access to Transportation whose
 
00:55:17.089 --> 00:55:17.099 align:start position:0%
family members maybe their only source
 
00:55:20.089 --> 00:55:20.099 align:start position:0%
of support for the family members they
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
may be the only person providing support
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
for that individual at home at any given
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
time and so they can't just pick up and
 
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
come to a meeting in Concord when they
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
live in Keene it's not ideal and it's
 
00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:38.540 align:start position:0%
typically not possible so again I think
 
00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
because of our uh the makeup of our
 
00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
organization we need to be able to make
 
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
consistent accommodations for those
 
00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
folks that have a really legitimate
 
00:55:53.089 --> 00:55:53.099 align:start position:0%
reason for not being able to be in
 
00:55:53.099 --> 00:55:55.670 align:start position:0%
reason for not being able to be in
person

00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:57.650 --> 00:55:57.660 align:start position:0%
could I interject a point of order Mr
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
chair uh having had the experience in a
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
previous committee
 
00:56:05.809 --> 00:56:05.819 align:start position:0%
of having had the clerk tell us that
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
once we got into 91a areas that were not
 
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
included in the original bill it was
 
00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
going to be a non-germaine Amendment and
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
we would need to have a whole new
 
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
hearing which is not a problem we can do
 
00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:18.410 align:start position:0%
hearing which is not a problem we can do
that

00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:19.130 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:19.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
I wonder if the answer here might not be
 
00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
in light of how very controversial those
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
Provisions are to save those for a
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
different Bill and to get this taken
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
care of and perhaps put in a bill next
 
00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
time to deal with the issue that we now
 
00:56:42.049 --> 00:56:42.059 align:start position:0%
know is an issue so we could put a bill
 
00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
in on that
 
00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
representative do you have a question
 
00:56:46.849 --> 00:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
regarding representative whoever's
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
kind of different
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
is it of the witness or yeah thank you
 
00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for taking my question
 
00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening to my question
 
00:57:02.329 --> 00:57:02.339 align:start position:0%
would you believe that if House Bill 308
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
passes it passed in the house and it's
 
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
no it would cover it would cover all
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
councils about remote meetings so it
 
00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
would it would take care of that so I
 
00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
hope the Senate is listening thank you
 
00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions
 
00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
I have no one else signed up to testify
 
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 30 does anyone else wish
 
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
seeing none I am going to close the
 
00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
public hearing on Senate Bill 30 and I
 
00:57:44.329 --> 00:57:44.339 align:start position:0%
am going to open the public hearing on
 
00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 35. uh Senate Senator
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald is the prime sponsor and I
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
good morning Senator good morning
 
00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:01.140 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record I'm Senator
 
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
Cindy Rosenwald from District 13 which
 
00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
is most of Nashua and I'm pleased to
 
00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:15.260 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill 35 which
 
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
anticipates FDA approval of two vaccines
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
against RSV this spring I'm not even
 
00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
going to try to pronounce the full name
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
um of this virus but this bill adds
 
00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:36.059 align:start position:0%
these two vaccines to the list of
 
00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:40.140 align:start position:0%
vaccinations that adults may receive in
 
00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:41.450 align:start position:0%
vaccinations that adults may receive in
pharmacies

00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
pharmacies
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
as we've read in the news are as few as
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
the disease that mostly affects children
 
00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
and has led to an increase in Pediatric
 
00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
Hospital admissions but is also among
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
the highest causes of respiratory
 
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
illness death in older adults the
 
00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:04.740 align:start position:0%
vaccine will be approved for adults over
 
00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:06.710 align:start position:0%
vaccine will be approved for adults over
60.

00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
60.
 
00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
allowing adults to receive vaccines in
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
pharmacies has been authorized for 15
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
years in New Hampshire I think I was the
 
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
original sponsor it's convenient and
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
it's less expensive than getting
 
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
vaccinated in a doctor's office since
 
00:59:29.089 --> 00:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
there's no need for a copay or
 
00:59:29.099 --> 00:59:30.650 align:start position:0%
there's no need for a copay or
co-insurance

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
co-insurance
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
saving time and money is a good way to
 
00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:36.140 align:start position:0%
encourage more adults to get recommended
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
vaccinations this bill has the support
 
00:59:42.049 --> 00:59:42.059 align:start position:0%
of the Board of Pharmacy and I hope the
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
committee will look favorably on it
 
00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:47.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Senator
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%

01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
um additions
 
01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
so there's the RSV and there is there
 
01:00:36.609 --> 01:00:36.619 align:start position:0%
another Edition as well no two different
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers oh I'm sorry RSV for
 
01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.010 align:start position:0%

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:45.660 align:start position:0%
Bill 35 as did the Senate Health and
 
01:00:48.049 --> 01:00:48.059 align:start position:0%
Human Services committee
 
01:00:48.059 --> 01:00:49.010 align:start position:0%
Human Services committee
um

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
as Senator Rosenwald indicated in her
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
testimony it it you know provides
 
01:00:58.250 --> 01:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
um uh changes the statute to allow for
 
01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
this uh vaccine to be administered in
 
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy community and what we found
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
during the whole covet experience over
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
the last few years
 
01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
well over 50 percent of all of the
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
coveted vaccines were administered in
 
01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning everyone my
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
name is Albert Rogers I'm the pharmacy
 
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
manager at Shaw's Pharmacy in Windham
 
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:28.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think this bill is a
 
01:01:30.609 --> 01:01:30.619 align:start position:0%
great idea both for to protect patients
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
and to just improve General Health in
 
01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm fully in some shots
 
01:01:40.609 --> 01:01:40.619 align:start position:0%
has been fully supportive this bill and
 
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
I hope uh hope it passes
 
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:50.569 --> 01:01:50.579 align:start position:0%
okay I'm seeing none thank you thank you
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
so much for your time have a wonderful
 
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
day thank you too
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
representative Gary Merchant
 
01:02:11.569 --> 01:02:11.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and for the record
 
01:18:54.970 --> 01:18:54.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:58.490 --> 01:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
proved disposal method was that we
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
listed every pill and the hospice nurse
 
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
and I flushed them and I am so guilty
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
about all those eight-legged frogs down
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
in Northfield and South but
 
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
this is a much better way
 
01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
again we worked with Des to make sure
 
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
that that kind of stuff doesn't happen
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
that does a nice controlled method for
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
disposal that's environmentally safe
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro in in the notes
 
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
from the Senate hearing there's some
 
01:19:32.689 --> 01:19:32.699 align:start position:0%
discussion which I don't fully
 
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
understand about different types of
 
01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:35.930 align:start position:0%
understand about different types of
medicine

01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:36.649 align:start position:0%
medicine
um

01:19:36.649 --> 01:19:36.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
liquid medicines but anyway the long and
 
01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
short of it would be that now all this
 
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
has been worked out and that all the
 
01:19:48.490 --> 01:19:48.500 align:start position:0%
medications that were
 
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
going to be unused or were unused would
 
01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
be able to be put in this lock box and
 
01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:55.850 align:start position:0%
be able to be put in this lock box and
um

01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
gotten rid of that way correct
 
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
correct it creates a proper disposal
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
method so one of the other committees I
 
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
serve on is Jack car and we just went
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
through a whole discussion about
 
01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
single-use bags for the drug take back
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
program that are that are
 
01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
environmentally safe and contained so if
 
01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
something were to break open it doesn't
 
01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:13.490 align:start position:0%
something were to break open it doesn't
leak

01:20:13.490 --> 01:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
leak
 
01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
01:20:24.770 --> 01:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
I don't know how it's disposed of you
 
01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:27.719 align:start position:0%
know in general but I'm assuming that in
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know the statute but are you
 
01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
aware does it do they have to maintain
 
01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:33.719 align:start position:0%
the labeling on the medications so that
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
they the pharmacist knows I mean I don't
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
think all the drugs are co-mingled is
 
01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
that correct I don't know the statue
 
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
that controls that but I would assume
 
01:20:44.209 --> 01:20:44.219 align:start position:0%
that they have to be disposed of with
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
the proper labeling on them is that
 
01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
correct again I'm outside my area of
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
expertise maybe somebody else can answer
 
01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
that of my understanding representative
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
rich is over there as quickly raising
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
his hand saying I know the answer so he
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
can answer your question over there he
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't there before so I was trying to
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
go to you but thank you
 
01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
representative Merton did you want to
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
speak on this sir
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
well in regards to the disposal of the
 
01:21:08.689 --> 01:21:08.699 align:start position:0%
medications first of all I want to say
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for bringing this
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
forth because it is a real problem with
 
01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
um both the amount of drugs to get
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
disposed to begin with I'd like to find
 
01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
a way to reduce it so we don't have to
 
01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
dispose of it but more importantly back
 
01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
into the packaging and so forth it
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
depends upon how it's disposed if you
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
will by the facility there's different
 
01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
ways to do it there's not one size fits
 
01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
all so it could be open to it I do know
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
from the Board of Pharmacy being on the
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
before this has been a problem I know we
 
01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
try to
 
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
take the medications that were not
 
01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
utilized and to redistribute them
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
through a quote Pharmacy but that didn't
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
pan out because there wasn't a lot of
 
01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
support for it but the problem you're
 
01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.070 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh sorry I'm new to
 
01:22:04.930 --> 01:22:04.940 align:start position:0%
this process like can you explain me uh
 
01:22:09.169 --> 01:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
sobious switch the new agency who will
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
have this burden and also like I saw
 
01:22:15.490 --> 01:22:15.500 align:start position:0%
some objection from Department of
 
01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services as is the ones
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
who will be paying uh for this new
 
01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.370 align:start position:0%
who will be paying uh for this new
process

01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:22:24.169 --> 01:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for your questions so the
 
01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
disposal process is the same the
 
01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
difference is it's not a one-off so it's
 
01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
not every time they have drugs they have
 
01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
to call the pharmacist and dispose of
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
the drugs they're allowed to
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
collectively collect the drugs and then
 
01:22:35.930 --> 01:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
call a pharmacist once so they instead
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
of having a pharmacist come to their
 
01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
facility say five or six times in a
 
01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
month they can come once and dispose of
 
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
everything at once as far as a des
 
01:22:45.290 --> 01:22:45.300 align:start position:0%
concern we did work with Des to craft an
 
01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
amendment in the Senate that took care
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
of the Des concerns and she's in the
 
01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
room she just thanked me for accepting
 
01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we crafted that meets
 
01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:06.189 --> 01:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:09.010 --> 01:23:09.020 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify is Rosemary
 
01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.050 --> 01:23:21.060 align:start position:0%
did I pronounce your last name correctly
 
01:23:23.570 --> 01:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
you did perfect thank you Rosemary
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
Seminole for a golden view Health Care
 
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
Center and I think I have the answers to
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
your questions so far
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
I brought a demonstration of what we do
 
01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:36.910 align:start position:0%
I brought a demonstration of what we do
now

01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.950 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
so the pills come like this from the
 
01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:44.780 align:start position:0%
pharmacy it's a month at a time
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
they are labeled on top here with the
 
01:23:48.719 --> 01:23:50.030 align:start position:0%
they are labeled on top here with the
information

01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:51.719 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
um when somebody as you say I'm sorry I
 
01:23:55.610 --> 01:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
have to interrupt you I've just been
 
01:23:57.709 --> 01:23:57.719 align:start position:0%
advised there's no props allowed and
 
01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
the past
 
01:24:13.729 --> 01:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
is that that way yes okay because I was
 
01:24:17.689 --> 01:24:17.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
we had the Whizzinator
 
01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know maybe there's been a change
 
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
that I didn't I don't know
 
01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
we have however been able to see what
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
she's talking about
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for doing that you
 
01:24:32.209 --> 01:24:32.219 align:start position:0%
know thank you for your intentions and
 
01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
01:24:36.890 --> 01:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
um anyway so it comes in a 30-day card
 
01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:39.719 align:start position:0%
um we do have Supply limits on things so
 
01:24:41.689 --> 01:24:41.699 align:start position:0%
we asked the pharmacy to govern it for
 
01:24:43.490 --> 01:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
us for the delivery so a seven day
 
01:24:45.649 --> 01:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
supply however depending on how the
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
provider writes this prescription we we
 
01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
do have a lot of medication left after
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
somebody passes away or discharges
 
01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
because we have a rehab
 
01:24:57.169 --> 01:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
um so then those pills are collected on
 
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
those cards there's a jug of called RX
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
Destroyer it's a chemical I don't know
 
01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
um and then the pills are pushed out of
 
01:25:10.490 --> 01:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
those cards one by one with a pharmacist
 
01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
and a nurse
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
and those pills are put in the base and
 
01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
the chemical goes in it and then it's
 
01:25:19.850 --> 01:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
destroyed in August we destroyed 4 000
 
01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
pills so it's labor intensive for the
 
01:25:24.050 --> 01:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and the nurse to sit there
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
literally and and poke them out
 
01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
um I did go to the Board of Pharmacy uh
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
to see if we nursing homes could have it
 
01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
they said no you have to have a change
 
01:25:35.090 --> 01:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
in the law and that's when I reached out
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
to the senator here and he was gracious
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
enough to help us so you know in this
 
01:25:42.169 --> 01:25:42.179 align:start position:0%
day and age with health care I look for
 
01:25:44.570 --> 01:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
efficiencies this will cut down on RN
 
01:25:47.330 --> 01:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
and pharmacist time and it's also safe
 
01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
because those
 
01:25:50.930 --> 01:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
um the take back boxes if you're not
 
01:25:53.570 --> 01:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
familiar with them are double locked the
 
01:25:55.810 --> 01:25:55.820 align:start position:0%
pharmacist has a key the nurse has a key
 
01:26:00.290 --> 01:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
and it's those cards are put in in its
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
totality into that that box you can't
 
01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
open the box once they're put in and
 
01:26:08.890 --> 01:26:08.900 align:start position:0%
then they're taken away and incinerated
 
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
we cannot put liquids in it though
 
01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
however that is not allowed at this
 
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
point in time but everything else is and
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
the Board of Pharmacy is supportive of
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
our efforts here
 
01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you are you taking questions or
 
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
I could try okay any questions yes
 
01:26:31.129 --> 01:26:31.139 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
see I didn't until now I have a question
 
01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
about the lock boxes can each key open
 
01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
that box individually or do you need
 
01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
both keys to both keys okay then that
 
01:26:43.729 --> 01:26:43.739 align:start position:0%
answers my question thank you
 
01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
you just piqued my interest what what
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
happens to the liquids
 
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
those are destroyed in the process that
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
we currently have okay thank you
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:00.540 align:start position:0%

kofalt expressed some reservations about
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
particularly in light of the fact that
 
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:47.460 align:start position:0%

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:48.470 align:start position:0%

Hampshire in Merrimack County
 
01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
I'm here before you as was stated to
 
01:46:50.930 --> 01:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate bill 83. I was actually
 
01:46:52.729 --> 01:46:52.739 align:start position:0%
asked to sponsor this bill by the New
 
01:46:54.050 --> 01:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire nurse practitioners
 
01:46:55.850 --> 01:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
Association of which we have
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
Representatives here today the purpose
 
01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
here is to help streamline patient care
 
01:47:02.209 --> 01:47:02.219 align:start position:0%
for patients streamline care for
 
01:47:04.370 --> 01:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
patients and decreased the cost for
 
01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
patients by cutting down on the number
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
of visits to a provider to have a form
 
01:47:12.290 --> 01:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
signed if this will also cut down on a
 
01:47:14.270 --> 01:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
duplication of effort within Health Care
 
01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:15.890 align:start position:0%
duplication of effort within Health Care
practices

01:47:15.890 --> 01:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
practices
 
01:47:18.590 --> 01:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 83 will update New Hampshire
 
01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
law to be congruent with current
 
01:47:23.050 --> 01:47:23.060 align:start position:0%
practice in New Hampshire currently
 
01:47:26.030 --> 01:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
outdated laws and institutional culture
 
01:47:28.669 --> 01:47:28.679 align:start position:0%
have forms that mandate a physician's
 
01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
signature even though they fall well
 
01:47:33.890 --> 01:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
within the practice of an advanced
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
practice registered nurse in aprm New
 
01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire nurse practitioners do have
 
01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
full autonomy of practice and are
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
signing many of these forms already
 
01:47:46.490 --> 01:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
aprns our nurse practitioners were
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
talking about are an integral part of
 
01:47:50.270 --> 01:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Health Care system and
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
are growing in numbers
 
01:47:54.350 --> 01:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
they serve all aspects of care
 
01:47:56.410 --> 01:47:56.420 align:start position:0%
outpatient care and hospital care
 
01:47:58.490 --> 01:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
specialty care and have received
 
01:48:00.590 --> 01:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
additional education in patient
 
01:48:03.770 --> 01:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
assessment diagnosis and treatment
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
The Institute of medicine the national
 
01:48:08.570 --> 01:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
Governors Governors Association and the
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
Federal Trade Commission among others
 
01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
all recommend removing practice barriers
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
for the APRN practice Senate Bill 83
 
01:48:19.250 --> 01:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
will help us move towards that goal
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
I am certainly happy to answer any
 
01:48:22.970 --> 01:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
questions you might have I do have
 
01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
Representatives again here with me and
 
01:48:27.290 --> 01:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
they have some more specific examples
 
01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:29.639 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to just offer one up and I
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
see Dr Palmer over here and I see Dr
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
Nagel on the other side if I missed any
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
other doctors or nurses I am sorry but
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
when my daughter would go to Camp
 
01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:41.090 align:start position:0%
when my daughter would go to Camp
Calumet

01:48:41.090 --> 01:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
Calumet
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
over in Freedom New Hampshire every
 
01:48:46.250 --> 01:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
summer she had a camp physical form that
 
01:48:48.410 --> 01:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
needed to be completed and down the
 
01:48:51.770 --> 01:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
bottom it would say physician signature
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
but she would have a nurse practitioner
 
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
complete her physical and so what
 
01:48:58.129 --> 01:48:58.139 align:start position:0%
happened was that the nurse practitioner
 
01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
who has this is within their scope of
 
01:49:01.790 --> 01:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
practice they're not signing anything
 
01:49:04.729 --> 01:49:04.739 align:start position:0%
that isn't within what they can do but
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
that clearly is so instead of sending me
 
01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
away and saying you're going to have to
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
see a different pediatrician or saw a
 
01:49:12.649 --> 01:49:12.659 align:start position:0%
different pediatric practitioner or
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
physician or leaving this for me to come
 
01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
back for or having to get it in the mail
 
01:49:18.890 --> 01:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
late they would
 
01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
sign the form because it was within
 
01:49:22.850 --> 01:49:22.860 align:start position:0%
their scope we need to line this up like
 
01:49:25.070 --> 01:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
other states have done to make this
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
practice efficient and in the best
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
interests of our patients in our Health
 
01:49:30.770 --> 01:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
Care system so I'll conclude my
 
01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm open to questions I think
 
01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
these folks might be better at it than I
 
01:49:36.770 --> 01:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
am but I could try okay thank you
 
01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:37.790 align:start position:0%
am but I could try okay thank you
senator

01:49:37.790 --> 01:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
questions for Senator Apprentice
 
01:49:42.770 --> 01:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you for um
 
01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
my question I just screwed up on that
 
01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
with the last question I'm like
 
01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely shocked that you can't do
 
01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
this now yeah I married two nurse
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
practitioners my wife's an identical
 
01:49:57.050 --> 01:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
twin and they're both nurse
 
01:49:57.060 --> 01:49:58.430 align:start position:0%
twin and they're both nurse
practitioners

01:49:58.430 --> 01:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
01:50:00.890 --> 01:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
and I was totally under the
 
01:50:03.290 --> 01:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
belief that they could do this now I'm
 
01:50:05.149 --> 01:50:05.159 align:start position:0%
surprised they can't
 
01:50:07.310 --> 01:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
they are signing for thank you thank you
 
01:50:09.770 --> 01:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
for the question they are signing forms
 
01:50:11.330 --> 01:50:11.340 align:start position:0%
within their own scope but this really
 
01:50:13.970 --> 01:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
needs to be clarified and you know I
 
01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question because it
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
reminds me of one thing that I didn't
 
01:50:19.609 --> 01:50:19.619 align:start position:0%
say uh we have support from the New
 
01:50:21.649 --> 01:50:21.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medical Society no you do yes
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
we've we've spoken with them early on in
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
the stakeholder process and sorted this
 
01:50:27.649 --> 01:50:27.659 align:start position:0%
out so we're in a good place there thank
 
01:50:29.450 --> 01:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
you Dr Nagel you're welcome thank you
 
01:50:33.410 --> 01:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
01:50:35.570 --> 01:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure you can answer this but
 
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question thank you Mr
 
01:50:42.530 --> 01:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
chairman for taking my questions thank
 
01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:43.270 align:start position:0%
chairman for taking my questions thank
you

01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:50:46.450 --> 01:50:46.460 align:start position:0%
I get excited about asking questions
 
01:50:49.970 --> 01:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
so your form the form that the the nurse
 
01:50:52.250 --> 01:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
practitioner signed for your daughter
 
01:50:53.930 --> 01:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
if the camp
 
01:50:56.209 --> 01:50:56.219 align:start position:0%
thinks it needs to be signed by a doctor
 
01:50:58.910 --> 01:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
can they reject it no and they didn't
 
01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:00.070 align:start position:0%
can they reject it no and they didn't
okay

01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
it was within their scope of practice to
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
sign that form well I understood that
 
01:51:06.590 --> 01:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
but I wondered about people they didn't
 
01:51:08.930 --> 01:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
even ask a question and if they had I
 
01:51:10.370 --> 01:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
would have pointed it out and I would
 
01:51:12.609 --> 01:51:12.619 align:start position:0%
think may I sorry
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
I would have pointed it out but I'll I
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
also think that most parents put in that
 
01:51:18.050 --> 01:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
position if they were asked that
 
01:51:20.930 --> 01:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
question would make a phone call verify
 
01:51:23.149 --> 01:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
and then go back to the camp I mean so
 
01:51:26.209 --> 01:51:26.219 align:start position:0%
we could fix all this by by doing this
 
01:51:27.709 --> 01:51:27.719 align:start position:0%
work and the state of Maine has done
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
this as well
 
01:51:31.250 --> 01:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome representative
 
01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:33.609 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome representative

01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
so to clarify what we're doing is
 
01:51:38.510 --> 01:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
conforming the statute with what's
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
already happening in practice correct
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%

01:54:52.010 --> 01:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 83 does not expand the scope
 
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
of practice for arnps it will only allow
 
01:54:58.490 --> 01:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
aarmps to sign paperwork that reflects
 
01:55:01.490 --> 01:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
the care they have already provided
 
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
to authorize the nurse practitioner who
 
01:55:06.649 --> 01:55:06.659 align:start position:0%
is already treating the patient to also
 
01:55:08.689 --> 01:55:08.699 align:start position:0%
treat the paperwork
 
01:55:11.510 --> 01:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
statues written before armps were
 
01:55:14.450 --> 01:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
providing the level of care they provide
 
01:55:17.470 --> 01:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
today have not been updated to include
 
01:55:21.290 --> 01:55:21.300 align:start position:0%

patient care documents
 
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
this disconnect between treating the
 
01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
patient and signing the paperwork
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
contributes to costly unnecessary

01:55:36.970 --> 01:55:36.980 align:start position:0%
can speak personally

I perform many Camp physicals in the

past and indeed uh
 
01:55:47.810 --> 01:55:47.820 align:start position:0%
they needed that extra step of a
 
01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:59.990 align:start position:0%
they needed that extra step of a
physician

01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
looks like a tour of a physician's
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
signature which which delayed uh the the
 
01:56:10.070 --> 01:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
form being submitted and sometimes
 
01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
um unreasonable delays because sometimes
 
01:56:15.290 --> 01:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
these forms uh as it happened were being
 
01:56:18.050 --> 01:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
submitted at the last minute
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh I would like to elaborate on
 
01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:22.970 align:start position:0%
uh I would like to elaborate on
um

01:56:22.970 --> 01:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
forms that uh
 
01:56:30.050 --> 01:56:30.060 align:start position:0%
might be
 
01:56:33.530 --> 01:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
um included in the daily provision of
 
01:56:35.450 --> 01:56:35.460 align:start position:0%

01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
will be needed to sign

I would
 
01:57:37.609 --> 01:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
appreciate any questions at this point
 
01:57:37.619 --> 01:57:39.050 align:start position:0%
appreciate any questions at this point
questions

01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:57:41.870 --> 01:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:57:44.450 --> 01:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:57:47.390 --> 01:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question a couple of us were
 
01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
talking before we opened the hearing on
 
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
the bill of being surprised that nurse
 
01:57:55.370 --> 01:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
practitioners couldn't do this because
 
01:57:58.609 --> 01:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
I'm remembering that when my late
 
01:58:01.310 --> 01:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
husband died at home as recent as far
 
01:58:04.609 --> 01:58:04.619 align:start position:0%
back as the year 2000 the hospice nurse
 
01:58:07.810 --> 01:58:07.820 align:start position:0%
who was not an advanced practice uh
 
01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:09.910 align:start position:0%
who was not an advanced practice uh
practitioner

01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
01:58:13.729 --> 01:58:13.739 align:start position:0%
was able to certify and and to fill out
 
01:58:17.089 --> 01:58:17.099 align:start position:0%
the death certificate then and so I was
 
01:58:19.129 --> 01:58:19.139 align:start position:0%
really surprised when I when I saw this
 
01:58:21.649 --> 01:58:21.659 align:start position:0%
but is that a specific exception because
 
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
of the hospice connection or is it
 
01:58:26.330 --> 01:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
probably probably I'm not as familiar
 
01:58:29.089 --> 01:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
with that but uh yes that's probably
 
01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
under that thank you
 
01:58:33.649 --> 01:58:33.659 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
taking the question so is the reason
 
01:58:42.649 --> 01:58:42.659 align:start position:0%
that this is necessary is because all of
 
01:58:45.169 --> 01:58:45.179 align:start position:0%
these forms
 
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
are in statute somehow are what I'm
 
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
sorry the forms themselves or in statute
 
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
is that the reason they couldn't just be
 
01:58:55.129 --> 01:58:55.139 align:start position:0%
changed to align with the actual
 
01:58:57.890 --> 01:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
practice we have to pass a law to
 
01:58:59.629 --> 01:58:59.639 align:start position:0%
actually do this yeah
 
01:59:01.129 --> 01:59:01.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
01:59:07.070 --> 01:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
so this may be I'm I'm looking for more
 
01:59:09.169 --> 01:59:09.179 align:start position:0%
relief from having to sign stuff than
 
01:59:11.149 --> 01:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
maybe is here
 
01:59:14.089 --> 01:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
um I uh because all of the things that
 
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
you brought up seemed like a
 
01:59:19.129 --> 01:59:19.139 align:start position:0%
perfectly Common Sense thing
 
01:59:20.930 --> 01:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
um I work in a critical access hospital
 
01:59:23.209 --> 01:59:23.219 align:start position:0%
as a hospitalist and so yesterday I was
 
01:59:25.070 --> 01:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
working with a nurse practitioner I
 
01:59:27.410 --> 01:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
worked with for years
 
01:59:29.149 --> 01:59:29.159 align:start position:0%
um in the critical access hospital and
 
01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
this isn't got to be a federal law I
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
still have to sign everything I know and
 
01:59:35.149 --> 01:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
so that's a little frustrating we're not
 
01:59:37.129 --> 01:59:37.139 align:start position:0%
going to solve that in New Hampshire the
 
01:59:38.750 --> 01:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
other one though that's a little less
 
01:59:40.850 --> 01:59:40.860 align:start position:0%
clear to me is
 
01:59:43.790 --> 01:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
um whether this would cover things like
 
01:59:47.089 --> 01:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
um durable medical equipment forms or um
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
or like Visiting Nurse referrals yeah I
 
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so because again I
 
01:59:54.589 --> 01:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
believe federally mandated anything to
 
01:59:57.530 --> 01:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
do with Medicare yeah
 
02:00:01.370 --> 02:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
it's too bad yeah again we're we're
 
02:00:02.810 --> 02:00:02.820 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
get that changed as well but yeah yeah
 
02:00:08.689 --> 02:00:08.699 align:start position:0%
well good luck on that thank you I would
 
02:00:10.850 --> 02:00:10.860 align:start position:0%
appreciate you
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions
 
02:00:26.689 --> 02:00:26.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:28.609 --> 02:00:28.619 align:start position:0%
I have no one else signed up to testify
 
02:00:31.010 --> 02:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 83 does anyone else wish
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
seeing no one else I'm going to close
 
02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on Senate bill 83.
 
02:00:40.609 --> 02:00:40.619 align:start position:0%
our next hearing is not scheduled until
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
1 pm
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
so we will be in recess until that time
 
02:00:46.490 --> 02:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you all
 
02:00:46.500 --> 03:14:39.370 align:start position:0%
thank you all
foreign

03:14:39.370 --> 03:14:39.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:43.370 --> 03:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
of the funding and is that from
 
03:14:43.380 --> 03:14:44.510 align:start position:0%
of the funding and is that from
insurance

03:14:44.510 --> 03:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:14:44.520 --> 03:14:47.389 align:start position:0%
insurance
companies

03:14:47.389 --> 03:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
companies
 
03:14:49.610 --> 03:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
so the current pillars of the system
 
03:14:51.230 --> 03:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
that exist today the lifeline call
 
03:14:52.670 --> 03:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
center is that someone to talk to and
 
03:14:54.349 --> 03:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
the mobile crisis response teams that's
 
03:14:57.590 --> 03:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere to go those are funded through
 
03:15:01.429 --> 03:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
um the through both Medicaid and state
 
03:15:03.830 --> 03:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
funds and state general funds and they
 
03:15:05.809 --> 03:15:05.819 align:start position:0%
what we're looking to do with the bill
 
03:15:07.790 --> 03:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
is really it's an education and
 
03:15:09.769 --> 03:15:09.779 align:start position:0%
recommendation opportunity so we're
 
03:15:12.530 --> 03:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
looking to make sure that we find figure
 
03:15:15.290 --> 03:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
out which mix of funding is best for New
 
03:15:16.910 --> 03:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to make sure the services are
 
03:15:19.010 --> 03:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
both robust and sustainable so it's
 
03:15:20.690 --> 03:15:20.700 align:start position:0%
about building out the somewhere to go
 
03:15:23.570 --> 03:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
third pillar of a crisis system that is
 
03:15:26.030 --> 03:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
that National best practice model and
 
03:15:27.889 --> 03:15:27.899 align:start position:0%
it's also about making sure the funding
 
03:15:31.010 --> 03:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
is sustainable over time so some of this
 
03:15:33.530 --> 03:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
is is currently funded yes is it funded
 
03:15:35.510 --> 03:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
long-term and robustly enough to meet
 
03:15:37.969 --> 03:15:37.979 align:start position:0%
the need of the state is the question so
 
03:15:39.710 --> 03:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
we would be looking for that committee
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
to study those pieces with the
 
03:15:44.330 --> 03:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
assistance of members from that 988
 
03:15:46.490 --> 03:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
Coalition who have done some of the
 
03:15:48.349 --> 03:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
research about what's working nationally
 
03:15:50.630 --> 03:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing and so
 
03:15:52.490 --> 03:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
that's the makeup and membership of that
 
03:15:54.650 --> 03:15:54.660 align:start position:0%
committee would help to inform what New
 
03:15:55.969 --> 03:15:55.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could do and what would be the
 
03:15:58.090 --> 03:15:58.100 align:start position:0%
right fit for our state
 
03:16:00.889 --> 03:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
03:16:04.250 --> 03:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
um I went before the oversight committee
 
03:16:07.070 --> 03:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
probably two three days ago
 
03:16:10.910 --> 03:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
and then much to my surprise this is
 
03:16:14.030 --> 03:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
very much like what I was asking the
 
03:16:17.210 --> 03:16:17.220 align:start position:0%
oversight committee to consider that
 
03:16:20.530 --> 03:16:20.540 align:start position:0%
they have the authority to form
 
03:16:24.889 --> 03:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh work and there seemed to
 
03:16:30.590 --> 03:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
be a positive response to my suggestions
 
03:16:32.510 --> 03:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
some people were saying don't you have
 
03:16:34.610 --> 03:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
enough to do already but
 
03:16:38.830 --> 03:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh the uh so I'm very pleased with this
 
03:16:42.170 --> 03:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm very pleased to see who the
 
03:16:47.450 --> 03:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
sponsors are that but but I'm trying to
 
03:16:51.769 --> 03:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
say where does this fit into what
 
03:16:55.309 --> 03:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
already exists the legislature in recent
 
03:16:56.870 --> 03:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
years has
 
03:17:01.429 --> 03:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
been very positive in their response and
 
03:17:03.889 --> 03:17:03.899 align:start position:0%
particularly in the development of the
 
03:17:07.550 --> 03:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
10-year plan so do you have any thoughts
 
03:17:10.610 --> 03:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
about how this
 
03:17:13.670 --> 03:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
the legislation fits into the 10-year
 
03:17:15.590 --> 03:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
mental health plan this is a direct
 
03:17:17.450 --> 03:17:17.460 align:start position:0%
build out of recommendations within the
 
03:17:19.070 --> 03:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
10-year mental health plan so making
 
03:17:21.050 --> 03:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
sure that there is a centralized access
 
03:17:23.450 --> 03:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
point when people are in crisis and that
 
03:17:25.490 --> 03:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
there is community-based response in
 
03:17:27.170 --> 03:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
that moment when people are most
 
03:17:30.290 --> 03:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and so the the this is you
 
03:17:31.849 --> 03:17:31.859 align:start position:0%
know baked in work right into the
 
03:17:33.710 --> 03:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
10-year Mental Health Plan
 
03:17:36.590 --> 03:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
um and the existing Services would also
 
03:17:38.809 --> 03:17:38.819 align:start position:0%
be a part of the fiscal analysis to make
 
03:17:41.030 --> 03:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
sure that that is the the pieces the
 
03:17:43.070 --> 03:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
services that are in place today the
 
03:17:44.809 --> 03:17:44.819 align:start position:0%
amazing strides that New Hampshire has
 
03:17:48.170 --> 03:17:48.180 align:start position:0%
made would be maintained long term and
 
03:17:52.610 --> 03:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:55.330 --> 03:17:55.340 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative Weber
 
03:17:57.650 --> 03:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you very
 
03:18:00.050 --> 03:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question
 
03:18:02.210 --> 03:18:02.220 align:start position:0%
um I have a lot of questions actually
 
03:18:04.969 --> 03:18:04.979 align:start position:0%
but the first one is how does this how
 
03:18:06.769 --> 03:18:06.779 align:start position:0%
does the existing doorways program
 
03:18:09.530 --> 03:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
interface with this and how are you
 
03:18:12.110 --> 03:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
contemplating rolling the two together
 
03:18:15.590 --> 03:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
given the number of
 
03:18:15.600 --> 03:18:17.750 align:start position:0%
given the number of
um

03:18:17.750 --> 03:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:19.370 --> 03:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
um substance abuse issues that are
 
03:18:21.530 --> 03:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
coexisting problems with with mental
 
03:18:23.690 --> 03:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
health issues a great question thank you
 
03:18:25.790 --> 03:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
so much so part of the 988 planning
 
03:18:28.910 --> 03:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
Coalition does uh also include doorway
 
03:18:28.920 --> 03:18:31.070 align:start position:0%
Coalition does uh also include doorway
Representatives

03:18:31.070 --> 03:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
03:18:33.050 --> 03:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
um it we also have our state opioid
 
03:18:34.849 --> 03:18:34.859 align:start position:0%
response director working very closely
 
03:18:36.590 --> 03:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
on this work who oversees the doorway
 
03:18:39.170 --> 03:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
program and we are looking at our the
 
03:18:40.910 --> 03:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rapid response in 988
 
03:18:43.490 --> 03:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
actually being a crisis as defined by
 
03:18:45.830 --> 03:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
the individual and so it does not take
 
03:18:48.170 --> 03:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
it does not say that you can only call
 
03:18:50.330 --> 03:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
for specific reasons it is an integrated
 
03:18:52.309 --> 03:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health response so you could
 
03:18:54.710 --> 03:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
call this Lifeline with a substance use
 
03:18:56.450 --> 03:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
disorder or people who use drugs people
 
03:18:58.429 --> 03:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
with a mental health or co-occurring
 
03:19:00.889 --> 03:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
illness it really would be just the
 
03:19:02.809 --> 03:19:02.819 align:start position:0%
crisis as defined by the person so we're
 
03:19:05.090 --> 03:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
building a more integrated system at
 
03:19:06.950 --> 03:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
this time your current state is going to
 
03:19:09.170 --> 03:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
be that that rapid response a 988 call
 
03:19:11.510 --> 03:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
line have memorandums of understanding
 
03:19:13.630 --> 03:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
in place with the doorways and can do
 
03:19:17.510 --> 03:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
transfers to them or referrals to them
 
03:19:19.790 --> 03:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
um when the person is de-escalated from
 
03:19:21.650 --> 03:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
the crisis we wouldn't transfer a call
 
03:19:23.870 --> 03:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
during a moment of Crisis but if we were
 
03:19:25.910 --> 03:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
able to de-escalate the caller and they
 
03:19:27.290 --> 03:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
were ready for a referral they work
 
03:19:29.570 --> 03:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
directly with the doorway to get people
 
03:19:31.130 --> 03:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
into substance use disorder treatment
 
03:19:33.950 --> 03:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
today and future State our inner our
 
03:19:36.050 --> 03:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
care in New Hampshire should continue to
 
03:19:38.809 --> 03:19:38.819 align:start position:0%
integrate more and more
 
03:19:40.550 --> 03:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
and follow up
 
03:19:42.590 --> 03:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
they're not follow-ups I have to set
 
03:19:44.510 --> 03:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
entirely separate questions so if you
 
03:19:46.250 --> 03:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
want to answer if you want to recognize
 
03:19:47.990 --> 03:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
somebody else that's fine but I do have
 
03:19:51.230 --> 03:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
a couple more go ahead okay so my second
 
03:19:53.210 --> 03:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:19:55.849 --> 03:19:55.859 align:start position:0%
um this Coalition already exists so why
 
03:19:58.309 --> 03:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
do we need to put it in statute yeah
 
03:19:59.990 --> 03:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's a great question so I think part of
 
03:20:01.429 --> 03:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
this is about making sure that we
 
03:20:03.469 --> 03:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
involve our legislature in the planning
 
03:20:05.450 --> 03:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
and the work and
 
03:20:07.190 --> 03:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
um and making sure that we come forward
 
03:20:10.130 --> 03:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
with recommendations that may include
 
03:20:12.530 --> 03:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
03:20:15.889 --> 03:20:15.899 align:start position:0%
and and one last one if I may and this
 
03:20:19.070 --> 03:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
may not be your area of expertise but I
 
03:20:21.170 --> 03:20:21.180 align:start position:0%
do note that this also includes
 
03:20:24.429 --> 03:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage provisions
 
03:20:26.450 --> 03:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
do you want to tell us a little bit
 
03:20:27.650 --> 03:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
about that or do you want to leave that
 
03:20:29.809 --> 03:20:29.819 align:start position:0%
to Senator Bradley who I see is now here
 
03:20:32.570 --> 03:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
or sure Senator Bradley new Futures and
 
03:20:33.769 --> 03:20:33.779 align:start position:0%
the insurance department have already
 
03:20:35.450 --> 03:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
collaborated closely on that portion of
 
03:20:36.769 --> 03:20:36.779 align:start position:0%
the bill so they really would be the
 
03:20:38.450 --> 03:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
best folks to answer any questions in
 
03:20:41.210 --> 03:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
that area okay thank you very much
 
03:20:43.190 --> 03:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative Nagel uh
 
03:20:44.809 --> 03:20:44.819 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro I'm sorry thank
 
03:20:46.309 --> 03:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
03:20:47.690 --> 03:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
the question
 
03:20:47.700 --> 03:20:48.889 align:start position:0%
the question
um

03:20:48.889 --> 03:20:48.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:53.630 --> 03:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
I certainly am a big supporter of mobile
 
03:20:58.309 --> 03:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
crisis teams um and that they're now at
 
03:21:00.290 --> 03:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
least attempting to be comprehensive
 
03:21:02.269 --> 03:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
03:21:02.279 --> 03:21:05.030 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
um one

03:21:05.030 --> 03:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
um one
 
03:21:08.090 --> 03:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
one concern I've heard locally
 
03:21:10.370 --> 03:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
um from consumers at our local Mental
 
03:21:12.670 --> 03:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
Health Center is that
 
03:21:16.309 --> 03:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
through their Emergency Services prior
 
03:21:18.889 --> 03:21:18.899 align:start position:0%
to there being a mobile crisis team when
 
03:21:21.830 --> 03:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
they called they were likely to speak to
 
03:21:21.840 --> 03:21:23.210 align:start position:0%
they called they were likely to speak to
someone

03:21:23.210 --> 03:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
someone
 
03:21:25.550 --> 03:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
an answering service first but quickly
 
03:21:28.309 --> 03:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
someone who was part of the local Mental
 
03:21:30.349 --> 03:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
Health Center and
 
03:21:33.889 --> 03:21:33.899 align:start position:0%
um maybe knew them or at the very least
 
03:21:36.590 --> 03:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
knew the people who worked with them and
 
03:21:38.990 --> 03:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
knew the resources in the community and
 
03:21:40.990 --> 03:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
now when they call they get somebody
 
03:21:43.910 --> 03:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
unless it's changed recently they get
 
03:21:47.389 --> 03:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
somebody out of state who does not know
 
03:21:49.450 --> 03:21:49.460 align:start position:0%
anything about the local
 
03:21:53.210 --> 03:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
resources the local services and
 
03:21:55.070 --> 03:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
certainly not that person's particular
 
03:21:59.330 --> 03:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
services so that was disconcerting to at
 
03:22:02.090 --> 03:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
least a few people who mentioned this to
 
03:22:04.610 --> 03:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
me and I wonder if there's any
 
03:22:07.130 --> 03:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
thoughts I know this is not directly
 
03:22:09.410 --> 03:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
related to this bill but if there are
 
03:22:11.330 --> 03:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
any thoughts to making the phone
 
03:22:11.340 --> 03:22:13.190 align:start position:0%
any thoughts to making the phone
response

03:22:13.190 --> 03:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
response
 
03:22:16.849 --> 03:22:16.859 align:start position:0%
kind of closer to the um
 
03:22:19.730 --> 03:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
consumers who are actually reaching out
 
03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
for help yeah thank you so much for your
 
03:22:24.110 --> 03:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
question we are very dedicated to
 
03:22:26.090 --> 03:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
figuring out quality improvement around
 
03:22:28.070 --> 03:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
the system every day it's such a new
 
03:22:29.690 --> 03:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire the
 
03:22:31.070 --> 03:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation in the tenure Mental
 
03:22:32.210 --> 03:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
Health Plan the 10-year Mental Health
 
03:22:36.110 --> 03:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
Plan was a broad stakeholder I did a lot
 
03:22:38.570 --> 03:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
of work of understanding deeply what are
 
03:22:40.070 --> 03:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
the needs in New Hampshire and the
 
03:22:42.110 --> 03:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation included a centralized
 
03:22:44.330 --> 03:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
access point in order to make sure that
 
03:22:46.250 --> 03:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
there was Equitable Services across the
 
03:22:47.990 --> 03:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
state because as you know what we have
 
03:22:50.570 --> 03:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
is some areas that are resource dense
 
03:22:52.670 --> 03:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
and others that are very resource scarce
 
03:22:54.650 --> 03:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
so making sure that no matter where
 
03:22:57.349 --> 03:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
you're located no matter your age and no
 
03:22:59.150 --> 03:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
matter why you're calling you can
 
03:23:02.330 --> 03:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
receive the same kind of care right and
 
03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
so that's the purpose of that
 
03:23:06.530 --> 03:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
centralized access point the the mobile
 
03:23:08.269 --> 03:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
crisis response teams are still
 
03:23:09.710 --> 03:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
connected to your Community Mental
 
03:23:12.290 --> 03:23:12.300 align:start position:0%
Health Centers I understand that it's a
 
03:23:14.570 --> 03:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
very challenging change whenever we go
 
03:23:16.370 --> 03:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
through a system transformation we have
 
03:23:16.380 --> 03:23:17.090 align:start position:0%
through a system transformation we have
pain

03:23:17.090 --> 03:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
pain
 
03:23:19.550 --> 03:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
right I think what how I best understand
 
03:23:21.290 --> 03:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
what you're describing is that we used
 
03:23:23.690 --> 03:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
to call our local police department and
 
03:23:25.910 --> 03:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
when we called 9-1-1 now we can't even
 
03:23:27.290 --> 03:23:27.300 align:start position:0%
remember what our local police
 
03:23:29.030 --> 03:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
department's phone numbers are it's not
 
03:23:31.670 --> 03:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
something we memorize right and so this
 
03:23:33.290 --> 03:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
is the idea of that centralized access
 
03:23:35.929 --> 03:23:35.939 align:start position:0%
point in some ways is similar I worry
 
03:23:37.910 --> 03:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
about likening it directly to 9-1-1
 
03:23:39.710 --> 03:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
because in 9-1-1 you always get an
 
03:23:41.510 --> 03:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
in-person response and it's pretty quick
 
03:23:43.969 --> 03:23:43.979 align:start position:0%
in Behavioral Health that's not always
 
03:23:45.710 --> 03:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
true at this time right it's not always
 
03:23:47.990 --> 03:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
really fast we're building something new
 
03:23:50.090 --> 03:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
and everyone doesn't need an in-person
 
03:23:52.130 --> 03:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
response but if you think about it from
 
03:23:53.929 --> 03:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
the phone number perspective we're
 
03:23:55.729 --> 03:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
trying to simplify that phone number so
 
03:23:57.250 --> 03:23:57.260 align:start position:0%
it's easier to use we're trying to
 
03:23:59.269 --> 03:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
centralize it so that we can have
 
03:24:01.729 --> 03:24:01.739 align:start position:0%
Equitable Services across the state and
 
03:24:03.229 --> 03:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
it's a work in progress and the
 
03:24:05.210 --> 03:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
department is doing quality improvement
 
03:24:07.130 --> 03:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
process has entered into a contract
 
03:24:09.229 --> 03:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
monitoring all of these services that
 
03:24:11.630 --> 03:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
also includes focus groups it includes
 
03:24:14.690 --> 03:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
surveys for consumers and any feedback
 
03:24:18.130 --> 03:24:18.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:20.990 --> 03:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
I thank you for that response and I
 
03:24:22.250 --> 03:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
think um
 
03:24:24.910 --> 03:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
change is difficult and
 
03:24:27.889 --> 03:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
whenever we consider any bill there's
 
03:24:30.650 --> 03:24:30.660 align:start position:0%
something gained and something lost and
 
03:24:32.570 --> 03:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
you have to go with the most benefit and
 
03:24:34.790 --> 03:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that I guess I just hope
 
03:24:38.450 --> 03:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
that you'll take this concern back to
 
03:24:41.090 --> 03:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
people who are monitoring
 
03:24:43.729 --> 03:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
um Quality and what what the real needs
 
03:24:45.290 --> 03:24:45.300 align:start position:0%
are absolutely it is something that
 
03:24:46.969 --> 03:24:46.979 align:start position:0%
we're already considering today thank
 
03:24:46.979 --> 03:24:48.050 align:start position:0%
we're already considering today thank
you

03:24:48.050 --> 03:24:48.060 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:24:51.349 --> 03:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:53.870 --> 03:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes sir representative Merchant
 
03:24:55.190 --> 03:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:24:56.570 --> 03:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
03:24:58.130 --> 03:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
on page
 
03:25:04.790 --> 03:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:07.190 --> 03:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
which is a tremendous statement
 
03:25:07.200 --> 03:25:08.929 align:start position:0%
which is a tremendous statement
removing

03:25:08.929 --> 03:25:08.939 align:start position:0%
removing
 
03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
prior authorization requirements does it
 
03:25:15.530 --> 03:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
apply to all payers or only some payers
 
03:25:18.050 --> 03:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
into all authorizations that require
 
03:25:20.269 --> 03:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
private authorization including
 
03:25:22.370 --> 03:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
admission to a hospital can you sort of
 
03:25:23.929 --> 03:25:23.939 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that as far as what the
 
03:25:25.849 --> 03:25:25.859 align:start position:0%
extent of that means I do think that
 
03:25:27.769 --> 03:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
question is better answered by Senator
 
03:25:29.150 --> 03:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
Bradley new futures or the insurance
 
03:25:32.690 --> 03:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
department thank you thank you
 
03:25:36.050 --> 03:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:37.910 --> 03:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions thank you
 
03:25:43.309 --> 03:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:45.050 --> 03:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
at this time I would welcome Senator
 
03:25:56.269 --> 03:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:58.010 --> 03:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
and he remembered his pink card that
 
03:26:00.410 --> 03:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened every time today
 
03:26:02.450 --> 03:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
Senator um
 
03:26:04.309 --> 03:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
um Kate lippman had also signed up and
 
03:26:05.750 --> 03:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
she said she was representing you I
 
03:26:07.250 --> 03:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
assume that's no longer yeah no other
 
03:26:08.510 --> 03:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's fine
 
03:26:11.030 --> 03:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
um but thank you Mr chair members of the
 
03:26:13.490 --> 03:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Jeff Bradley uh
 
03:26:15.889 --> 03:26:15.899 align:start position:0%
from Senate District 3 apologized I was
 
03:26:19.790 --> 03:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
testifying on a bill across the hall
 
03:26:23.690 --> 03:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
so I was approached to file this bill by
 
03:26:26.650 --> 03:26:26.660 align:start position:0%
new Futures who are here today to
 
03:26:30.590 --> 03:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
testify in support of it
 
03:26:34.070 --> 03:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
um it's actually a fairly simple bill
 
03:26:36.830 --> 03:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
let me just try to go through
 
03:26:38.750 --> 03:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
um you know some of the parameters of
 
03:26:40.250 --> 03:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:26:45.349 --> 03:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
as the purpose statement outlines in
 
03:26:48.349 --> 03:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
2020 the National Suicide Hotline
 
03:26:51.010 --> 03:26:51.020 align:start position:0%
designation Act was signed into law
 
03:26:53.030 --> 03:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
currently right now there are two
 
03:26:56.389 --> 03:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
vendors I'm using primarily federal
 
03:26:59.410 --> 03:26:59.420 align:start position:0%
funds to operate this
 
03:27:04.070 --> 03:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
suicide line 988 that's run by the
 
03:27:05.510 --> 03:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
substance abuse of Mental Health
 
03:27:08.450 --> 03:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
Services Administration
 
03:27:08.460 --> 03:27:09.110 align:start position:0%
Services Administration
um

03:27:09.110 --> 03:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:11.469 --> 03:27:11.479 align:start position:0%
obviously suicide mental health
 
03:27:14.690 --> 03:27:14.700 align:start position:0%
substance misuse huge problems around
 
03:27:18.650 --> 03:27:18.660 align:start position:0%
the country huge problems in our state
 
03:27:21.830 --> 03:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
so having a 988 line
 
03:27:24.710 --> 03:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
is very important I think for every
 
03:27:28.250 --> 03:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
person in the state of New Hampshire so
 
03:27:30.410 --> 03:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
the purpose of
 
03:27:33.170 --> 03:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
the commission that's established just
 
03:27:35.750 --> 03:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
to look at a sustainable way to fund it
 
03:27:37.630 --> 03:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
as that Federal funding
 
03:27:41.870 --> 03:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
may not always be available and so that
 
03:27:46.729 --> 03:27:46.739 align:start position:0%
is the large purpose of the
 
03:27:46.739 --> 03:27:47.750 align:start position:0%
is the large purpose of the
um

03:27:47.750 --> 03:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:50.030 --> 03:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
commission that's created in this bill
 
03:27:53.830 --> 03:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
there's also a new definition
 
03:27:57.190 --> 03:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
on page two of what a Behavioral Health
 
03:28:01.490 --> 03:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
crisis program is that is in line with
 
03:28:02.650 --> 03:28:02.660 align:start position:0%
this Federal
 
03:28:06.889 --> 03:28:06.899 align:start position:0%
legislation the purpose statement
 
03:28:11.210 --> 03:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
outlines some of the pillars of what a
 
03:28:13.990 --> 03:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:17.330 --> 03:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
intervention and stabilization should
 
03:28:20.630 --> 03:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
look like and that's Roman 3 on page two
 
03:28:23.210 --> 03:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
line seven through
 
03:28:25.670 --> 03:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
um 20.
 
03:28:28.370 --> 03:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
obviously we want to create that as much
 
03:28:31.490 --> 03:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
as possible here in New Hampshire so a
 
03:28:36.290 --> 03:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
broad array of Public Health experts
 
03:28:39.530 --> 03:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
in the commission outlined on page three
 
03:28:43.130 --> 03:28:43.140 align:start position:0%
and then there was a question from
 
03:28:46.250 --> 03:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant about section
 
03:28:49.190 --> 03:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
four you referred to you know the
 
03:28:51.950 --> 03:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
purpose statement in it but it this
 
03:28:56.630 --> 03:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
ensures that prior authorizations are
 
03:28:59.750 --> 03:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
treated the same for mental health as
 
03:29:02.330 --> 03:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
they are under current law for substance
 
03:29:04.070 --> 03:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
abuse I mean that just makes all the
 
03:29:07.429 --> 03:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
sense in the world that's section four
 
03:29:10.250 --> 03:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
um I just looked up the bill because I
 
03:29:13.429 --> 03:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
had to refresh my memory there was no
 
03:29:16.490 --> 03:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
controversy about this bill as I recall
 
03:29:20.210 --> 03:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
in the Senate it passed out of the
 
03:29:22.190 --> 03:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
um Senate Health and Human Services
 
03:29:24.290 --> 03:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
committee on the consent calendar went
 
03:29:27.250 --> 03:29:27.260 align:start position:0%
to finance and passed on a Voice vote so
 
03:29:29.929 --> 03:29:29.939 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to answer any
 
03:29:29.939 --> 03:29:31.190 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to answer any
questions

03:29:31.190 --> 03:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:29:33.650 --> 03:29:33.660 align:start position:0%
for Senator Bradley
 
03:29:41.570 --> 03:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:42.950 --> 03:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:29:42.960 --> 03:29:44.030 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

03:29:44.030 --> 03:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:29:47.030 --> 03:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
so is the purpose of the language on
 
03:29:51.349 --> 03:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
page four lines 10 uh and and following
 
03:29:54.469 --> 03:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
is the purpose of that to ensure that
 
03:29:57.410 --> 03:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
there is uh insurance coverage for these
 
03:29:59.090 --> 03:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
services or is the purpose of that
 
03:30:01.070 --> 03:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
something slightly different now the
 
03:30:03.849 --> 03:30:03.859 align:start position:0%
purpose of it is to ensure that the same
 
03:30:06.710 --> 03:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
treatment for prior authorizations under
 
03:30:10.090 --> 03:30:10.100 align:start position:0%
insurance law that currently exists for
 
03:30:13.190 --> 03:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
substance misuse which is pretty
 
03:30:16.370 --> 03:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
expedited prior authorization also
 
03:30:19.790 --> 03:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
applies for mental health crises
 
03:30:21.910 --> 03:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
and may I have a follow-up
 
03:30:25.910 --> 03:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
that brings us back to the piece
 
03:30:27.650 --> 03:30:27.660 align:start position:0%
highlighted I think by representative
 
03:30:30.769 --> 03:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
Merchant uh
 
03:30:34.010 --> 03:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
because there's a statement about on
 
03:30:37.370 --> 03:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
page two line four about removing prior
 
03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
authorization requirements therefore
 
03:30:41.929 --> 03:30:41.939 align:start position:0%
making Health Care treatment accessible
 
03:30:44.090 --> 03:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
without delay and that's the whole point
 
03:30:46.610 --> 03:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
so the prior authorization requirements
 
03:30:47.929 --> 03:30:47.939 align:start position:0%
and their
 
03:30:47.939 --> 03:30:49.309 align:start position:0%
and their
um

03:30:49.309 --> 03:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:51.170 --> 03:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
I think there are other people that can
 
03:30:53.990 --> 03:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
answer specifically what they are and
 
03:30:56.330 --> 03:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
you probably remember because I believe
 
03:31:00.590 --> 03:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
you were on the Commission in 2015 or 16
 
03:31:03.410 --> 03:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
that representative hinch and I
 
03:31:06.190 --> 03:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
um chaired where we wrote much of the
 
03:31:09.650 --> 03:31:09.660 align:start position:0%
legislation and included expedited prior
 
03:31:12.170 --> 03:31:12.180 align:start position:0%
authorizations no I missed that one but
 
03:31:14.090 --> 03:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
oh well okay
 
03:31:15.650 --> 03:31:15.660 align:start position:0%
um sorry about that I thought you were
 
03:31:17.929 --> 03:31:17.939 align:start position:0%
but in any case we wanted to make sure
 
03:31:20.450 --> 03:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
that people didn't get hung up in the
 
03:31:23.389 --> 03:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
middle of a substance abuse crisis with
 
03:31:26.870 --> 03:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
a prior authorization and so we
 
03:31:29.330 --> 03:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
fixed it if you will we want to make
 
03:31:31.610 --> 03:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
sure that the same treatment for mental
 
03:31:33.490 --> 03:31:33.500 align:start position:0%
health crises
 
03:31:36.830 --> 03:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
is part of the New Hampshire law thank
 
03:31:38.530 --> 03:31:38.540 align:start position:0%
you very much that helps a lot yeah
 
03:31:41.450 --> 03:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
representative McKay
 
03:31:46.309 --> 03:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:31:48.290 --> 03:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know what's the purp what's the

proper title now I think as Mr President
 
03:31:51.660 --> 03:31:53.090 align:start position:0%
proper title now I think as Mr President
uh

03:31:53.090 --> 03:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:31:57.830 --> 03:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:59.389 --> 03:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
call me anything you want just don't
 
03:32:02.150 --> 03:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
call me a Yankee fan
 
03:32:04.490 --> 03:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
today is oh we have some Yankee fans
 
03:32:04.500 --> 03:32:04.850 align:start position:0%
today is oh we have some Yankee fans
here

03:32:04.850 --> 03:32:04.860 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:32:04.860 --> 03:32:06.889 align:start position:0%
here
[Laughter]

03:32:06.889 --> 03:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:32:10.010 --> 03:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
today it's all positive well I say that
 
03:32:11.809 --> 03:32:11.819 align:start position:0%
because tomorrow's opening day you know
 
03:32:14.929 --> 03:32:14.939 align:start position:0%
the uh I went before the oversight
 
03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
committee on health and
 
03:32:20.389 --> 03:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
Human Services up two or three days ago
 
03:32:25.690 --> 03:32:25.700 align:start position:0%
to ask that they form a committee that
 
03:32:28.870 --> 03:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
feels very much like what this is doing
 
03:32:32.229 --> 03:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
that was met with
 
03:32:35.090 --> 03:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
a positive response I think and that
 
03:32:38.870 --> 03:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
they were willing to use the
 
03:32:41.210 --> 03:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
structure that's already there and has
 
03:32:44.389 --> 03:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
been used in the past so that part of
 
03:32:45.950 --> 03:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
03:32:50.990 --> 03:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh I think is super and and as far as
 
03:32:52.969 --> 03:32:52.979 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned we can go ahead and start
 
03:32:56.269 --> 03:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
doing this immediately that's one of the
 
03:32:59.269 --> 03:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
advantages of the
 
03:33:01.849 --> 03:33:01.859 align:start position:0%
um that committee is that they don't
 
03:33:04.250 --> 03:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
have to wait till all of the process
 
03:33:06.830 --> 03:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
goes on
 
03:33:08.510 --> 03:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
I am
 
03:33:08.520 --> 03:33:10.309 align:start position:0%
I am
extremely

03:33:10.309 --> 03:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
03:33:15.410 --> 03:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
excited to see this legislation and
 
03:33:20.090 --> 03:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
and support it in in general
 
03:33:22.849 --> 03:33:22.859 align:start position:0%
um the the part that confused me a bit
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
was that there's no appropriation
 
03:33:27.950 --> 03:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
in this legislation
 
03:33:31.610 --> 03:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
and so again let me just stress what the
 
03:33:33.469 --> 03:33:33.479 align:start position:0%
purpose the primary purpose of the
 
03:33:35.330 --> 03:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
commission is
 
03:33:39.950 --> 03:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
um the 988 line right now is funded
 
03:33:39.960 --> 03:33:40.670 align:start position:0%
um the 988 line right now is funded
um

03:33:40.670 --> 03:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:44.030 --> 03:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
primarily by federal funds
 
03:33:47.090 --> 03:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
through two organizations Beacon access
 
03:33:50.990 --> 03:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
point and head rest Beacon is funded
 
03:33:51.000 --> 03:33:52.969 align:start position:0%
point and head rest Beacon is funded
with

03:33:52.969 --> 03:33:52.979 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:33:54.950 --> 03:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
um eight percent federal funds and
 
03:33:57.010 --> 03:33:57.020 align:start position:0%
actually 92 percent
 
03:34:00.889 --> 03:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
federal funds headrest is funded 18
 
03:34:03.410 --> 03:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
federal funds and 82 percent federal
 
03:34:07.250 --> 03:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
funds but my understanding is these were
 
03:34:07.260 --> 03:34:08.389 align:start position:0%
funds but my understanding is these were
um

03:34:08.389 --> 03:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:12.530 --> 03:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
funds that uh came from arpa now I could
 
03:34:15.349 --> 03:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
be wrong on that but in any case we need
 
03:34:15.359 --> 03:34:16.690 align:start position:0%
be wrong on that but in any case we need
a

03:34:16.690 --> 03:34:16.700 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:34:19.670 --> 03:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
permanent funding mechanism to ensure
 
03:34:23.630 --> 03:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
the continuation of the 988
 
03:34:26.090 --> 03:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
suicide line and that's what the primary
 
03:34:29.870 --> 03:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:34.010 --> 03:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:38.030 --> 03:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
in my backing thank you
 
03:34:39.889 --> 03:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:34:42.590 --> 03:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
03:34:44.269 --> 03:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
how long if you know is the federal
 
03:34:48.229 --> 03:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
funding going to hold up for I what kind
 
03:34:50.030 --> 03:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
of time frame are we under that I don't
 
03:34:52.969 --> 03:34:52.979 align:start position:0%
know and I suspect the folks from new
 
03:34:54.889 --> 03:34:54.899 align:start position:0%
Futures can answer that
 
03:34:56.809 --> 03:34:56.819 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing heads nodding behind you so
 
03:34:58.790 --> 03:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:35:02.690 --> 03:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:04.849 --> 03:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Senator chair
 
03:35:13.210 --> 03:35:13.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:16.130 --> 03:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak appropriately
 
03:35:43.849 --> 03:35:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:43.859 --> 03:35:45.130 align:start position:0%
 
hello

03:35:45.130 --> 03:35:45.140 align:start position:0%
hello
 
03:35:47.990 --> 03:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
please put your microphone on sorry
 
03:35:50.269 --> 03:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
there you go thank you for having me I'm
 
03:35:51.349 --> 03:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
Emma savini I'm the children's
 
03:35:53.090 --> 03:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health policy coordinator at
 
03:35:55.790 --> 03:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
new Futures and as Senator Bradley um
 
03:35:57.830 --> 03:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned we approached him
 
03:35:59.750 --> 03:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
um about this bill
 
03:36:01.250 --> 03:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
um after working with that Coalition
 
03:36:03.590 --> 03:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
that the department mentioned
 
03:36:04.969 --> 03:36:04.979 align:start position:0%
um on the 988 planning and
 
03:36:07.309 --> 03:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
implementation we felt that this was the
 
03:36:09.290 --> 03:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
appropriate next step to start the
 
03:36:10.790 --> 03:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
legislative process into finding a
 
03:36:12.710 --> 03:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
sustainable funding source for these
 
03:36:12.720 --> 03:36:14.030 align:start position:0%
sustainable funding source for these
programs

03:36:14.030 --> 03:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
programs
 
03:36:16.070 --> 03:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
um so as everyone has mentioned the bill
 
03:36:18.889 --> 03:36:18.899 align:start position:0%
just creates a study commission to look
 
03:36:22.670 --> 03:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
at the best possible funding stream for
 
03:36:24.410 --> 03:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
sustainable funding for these programs
 
03:36:27.710 --> 03:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as was mentioned every
 
03:36:29.090 --> 03:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
state is grappling with this and every
 
03:36:30.410 --> 03:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
state is kind of looking at different
 
03:36:33.170 --> 03:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
models but we want one that fits New
 
03:36:33.180 --> 03:36:34.729 align:start position:0%
models but we want one that fits New
Hampshire

03:36:34.729 --> 03:36:34.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:36:36.769 --> 03:36:36.779 align:start position:0%
um secondly that pre-authorization
 
03:36:38.809 --> 03:36:38.819 align:start position:0%
section it removes the pre-authorization
 
03:36:42.729 --> 03:36:42.739 align:start position:0%
requirement for Behavioral Health crisis
 
03:36:45.590 --> 03:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
emergencies and that does include
 
03:36:47.870 --> 03:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
substance use emergencies as well it
 
03:36:50.929 --> 03:36:50.939 align:start position:0%
brings us in line both with uh creating
 
03:36:52.729 --> 03:36:52.739 align:start position:0%
parity between substance use disorder
 
03:36:55.370 --> 03:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
and mental health crises and then also
 
03:36:57.889 --> 03:36:57.899 align:start position:0%
you know physical ailments and mental
 
03:37:00.110 --> 03:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
health crises
 
03:37:02.450 --> 03:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
um I believe the last question was when
 
03:37:05.330 --> 03:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
the federal funding runs out just after
 
03:37:11.210 --> 03:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
just a quick look it looks like the 988
 
03:37:13.849 --> 03:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
there are two call centers those funding
 
03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
streams are approved it looks like
 
03:37:18.229 --> 03:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
annually in the governor's uh through
 
03:37:20.570 --> 03:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
governor and Council and they have
 
03:37:22.610 --> 03:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
contracts that run through June of 2023
 
03:37:23.870 --> 03:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
so this year and then they have the
 
03:37:26.929 --> 03:37:26.939 align:start position:0%
option to be renewed and they are a mix
 
03:37:30.530 --> 03:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
of federal and general funds for each
 
03:37:30.540 --> 03:37:31.250 align:start position:0%
of federal and general funds for each
um

03:37:31.250 --> 03:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:34.790 --> 03:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
call center and so those federal funds
 
03:37:37.490 --> 03:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
may be renewed but we will need a
 
03:37:39.229 --> 03:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
sustainable funding eventually those
 
03:37:42.590 --> 03:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
those funds will be gone
 
03:37:43.969 --> 03:37:43.979 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to take any other questions
 
03:37:43.979 --> 03:37:45.590 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to take any other questions
or

03:37:45.590 --> 03:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:37:45.600 --> 03:37:47.110 align:start position:0%
or
um

03:37:47.110 --> 03:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:50.450 --> 03:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
okay representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
03:37:52.610 --> 03:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for
 
03:37:54.590 --> 03:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:37:57.349 --> 03:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
um with the removal of pre-authorization
 
03:38:00.290 --> 03:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
is it removal of it or Expediting it
 
03:38:03.469 --> 03:38:03.479 align:start position:0%
it's the removal of it so um thank you
 
03:38:04.910 --> 03:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank you question so so my the second
 
03:38:06.410 --> 03:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
part of my question you can answer it
 
03:38:10.190 --> 03:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
all is um does this include
 
03:38:12.950 --> 03:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
Services provided in an emergency room
 
03:38:15.490 --> 03:38:15.500 align:start position:0%
or out in the community or does it also
 
03:38:19.969 --> 03:38:19.979 align:start position:0%
include Hospital admissions
 
03:38:21.349 --> 03:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's a great question
 
03:38:23.809 --> 03:38:23.819 align:start position:0%
so the Emergency Services definition
 
03:38:23.819 --> 03:38:25.490 align:start position:0%
so the Emergency Services definition
covers

03:38:25.490 --> 03:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
covers
 
03:38:25.500 --> 03:38:26.269 align:start position:0%
covers
um

03:38:26.269 --> 03:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:28.010 --> 03:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
any health care services that are
 
03:38:30.050 --> 03:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
provided to an enrollee
 
03:38:32.510 --> 03:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
um in a or insured or subscriber in a
 
03:38:35.030 --> 03:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
licensed Hospital facility so it would
 
03:38:35.040 --> 03:38:35.990 align:start position:0%
licensed Hospital facility so it would
be

03:38:35.990 --> 03:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:38:37.550 --> 03:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
um you know going to the emergency room
 
03:38:38.830 --> 03:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
for a crisis
 
03:38:43.070 --> 03:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
or showing up to um eventually if this
 
03:38:44.809 --> 03:38:44.819 align:start position:0%
is the form that pillar takes an
 
03:38:47.630 --> 03:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
emergency crisis facility on one of
 
03:38:49.190 --> 03:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
those as well
 
03:38:52.729 --> 03:38:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:55.510 --> 03:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
so I have two follow-up questions really
 
03:38:57.349 --> 03:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
one is
 
03:39:00.530 --> 03:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
um so does it also exclude uh
 
03:39:02.750 --> 03:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
authorization for an admission if that
 
03:39:04.670 --> 03:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
hospital if that person is to be
 
03:39:07.849 --> 03:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:07.859 --> 03:39:09.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:39:09.349 --> 03:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:11.809 --> 03:39:11.819 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I believe it
 
03:39:14.389 --> 03:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
would cover if that admission is part of
 
03:39:16.429 --> 03:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
the emergency services that are needed
 
03:39:19.190 --> 03:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
to handle that emergency crisis
 
03:39:21.950 --> 03:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
um yes but if it is an admission after
 
03:39:25.130 --> 03:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
the emergency crisis has resolved that
 
03:39:27.050 --> 03:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
would be a separate thing that may may
 
03:39:32.630 --> 03:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:36.830 --> 03:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
um so one thing I'm unsure a little
 
03:39:39.590 --> 03:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
unsure of is that since
 
03:39:41.630 --> 03:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's often talked
 
03:39:45.349 --> 03:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
about when as one of the benefits of
 
03:39:48.349 --> 03:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis teams is that potentially
 
03:39:50.750 --> 03:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
can keep people out of emergency rooms
 
03:39:53.929 --> 03:39:53.939 align:start position:0%
and provide services in homes and
 
03:39:56.389 --> 03:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
schools in the community
 
03:40:00.590 --> 03:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
so why aren't we also
 
03:40:00.600 --> 03:40:01.210 align:start position:0%
so why aren't we also
um

03:40:01.210 --> 03:40:01.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:03.650 --> 03:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
excluding pre-authorizations for
 
03:40:05.929 --> 03:40:05.939 align:start position:0%
services that happen elsewhere otherwise
 
03:40:08.929 --> 03:40:08.939 align:start position:0%
we're kind of incentivizing people
 
03:40:10.969 --> 03:40:10.979 align:start position:0%
to give these services in emergency
 
03:40:10.979 --> 03:40:12.229 align:start position:0%
to give these services in emergency
rooms

03:40:12.229 --> 03:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
rooms
 
03:40:14.090 --> 03:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
03:40:17.330 --> 03:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding that with the
 
03:40:20.030 --> 03:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis Services those are handled
 
03:40:21.650 --> 03:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
a little bit differently and I'm not
 
03:40:23.510 --> 03:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
sure the intricacies of the insurance
 
03:40:26.389 --> 03:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
coverage for those pieces so that may be
 
03:40:28.490 --> 03:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
better answered by the insurance
 
03:40:28.500 --> 03:40:29.929 align:start position:0%
better answered by the insurance
department

03:40:29.929 --> 03:40:29.939 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:40:31.790 --> 03:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:40:35.269 --> 03:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
other questions uh representative Weber
 
03:40:37.309 --> 03:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
thank you this is just if you know you
 
03:40:39.830 --> 03:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
may not have any knowledge of this but I
 
03:40:41.870 --> 03:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
wound up sitting on finance yesterday so
 
03:40:43.910 --> 03:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about these things do you
 
03:40:45.530 --> 03:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
have any idea if the governor has
 
03:40:47.389 --> 03:40:47.399 align:start position:0%
included any funds or if the department
 
03:40:50.450 --> 03:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
included any funds for the gap between
 
03:40:54.050 --> 03:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
say June of 2023 going forward for these
 
03:40:56.570 --> 03:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
Services because it seems to me that
 
03:40:58.130 --> 03:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
what we're planning for here is
 
03:40:58.140 --> 03:41:00.490 align:start position:0%
what we're planning for here is
long-term

03:41:00.490 --> 03:41:00.500 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
03:41:04.370 --> 03:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
funding sources but we need to get from
 
03:41:06.290 --> 03:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
here to long term if if the current
 
03:41:08.750 --> 03:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
Source comes to an end on the 23rd on
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
the end of in the end of June
 
03:41:12.650 --> 03:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question it's my
 
03:41:14.090 --> 03:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
understanding that those contracts have
 
03:41:15.710 --> 03:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
the option to be extended already built
 
03:41:16.969 --> 03:41:16.979 align:start position:0%
into them
 
03:41:18.349 --> 03:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
um but I can double check on that
 
03:41:20.330 --> 03:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
information and get it back to you and
 
03:41:22.969 --> 03:41:22.979 align:start position:0%
if I may for follow-up the the issue is
 
03:41:25.130 --> 03:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
not whether the contracts may be renewed
 
03:41:26.690 --> 03:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
but whether there will be the funds to
 
03:41:28.910 --> 03:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
pay for them if they are renewed so
 
03:41:30.410 --> 03:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
that's that's my specific question I
 
03:41:32.210 --> 03:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
understand now if you can find if you
 
03:41:33.349 --> 03:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
can find that out that would be really
 
03:41:35.570 --> 03:41:35.580 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you
 
03:41:38.150 --> 03:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative McKay
 
03:41:40.429 --> 03:41:40.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:41:40.439 --> 03:41:41.929 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
it

03:41:41.929 --> 03:41:41.939 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:41:46.190 --> 03:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:50.210 --> 03:41:50.220 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I just went
 
03:41:53.150 --> 03:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
before the oversight committee on Health
 
03:41:54.769 --> 03:41:54.779 align:start position:0%
and Human Services
 
03:41:57.950 --> 03:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
with a suggestion that is very similar
 
03:42:01.510 --> 03:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
to this uh
 
03:42:01.520 --> 03:42:03.370 align:start position:0%
to this uh
recommendation

03:42:03.370 --> 03:42:03.380 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
03:42:07.969 --> 03:42:07.979 align:start position:0%
that we form a committee to essentially
 
03:42:12.050 --> 03:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
look into the 10-year plan which covers
 
03:42:16.250 --> 03:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
all of the details would you believe
 
03:42:20.690 --> 03:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
that we can work much faster under the
 
03:42:23.150 --> 03:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
oversight committee than the whole
 
03:42:27.469 --> 03:42:27.479 align:start position:0%
procedure we have to go through to form
 
03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
committees so that we could form that
 
03:42:34.630 --> 03:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
committee and it has had a positive
 
03:42:37.389 --> 03:42:37.399 align:start position:0%
response so far
 
03:42:41.090 --> 03:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
that would you believe that that part of
 
03:42:42.670 --> 03:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
03:42:48.290 --> 03:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:51.410 --> 03:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
um I would believe that you're you're um
 
03:42:54.349 --> 03:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
I could say new future very likely would
 
03:42:56.110 --> 03:42:56.120 align:start position:0%
be on that committee
 
03:42:58.790 --> 03:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
that that would be excellent and um I'd
 
03:43:00.410 --> 03:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
be happy to look into that as well thank
 
03:43:02.150 --> 03:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
you for bringing that to my attention
 
03:43:07.250 --> 03:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:08.750 --> 03:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
saying no other questions thank you
 
03:43:16.130 --> 03:43:16.140 align:start position:0%

Hampshire I'm here today in support of
 
03:44:01.070 --> 03:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 85. before I go into a
 
03:44:02.450 --> 03:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
little bit of my testimony and why we're
 
03:44:04.370 --> 03:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
here today just heard from the
 
03:44:05.809 --> 03:44:05.819 align:start position:0%
Department that the funding goes through
 
03:44:05.819 --> 03:44:07.790 align:start position:0%
Department that the funding goes through
2025.

03:44:07.790 --> 03:44:07.800 align:start position:0%

you're welcome

03:44:14.809 --> 03:44:14.819 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to go through some of
 
03:44:16.370 --> 03:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
the statistic statistics that you
 
03:44:17.510 --> 03:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
haven't heard
 
03:44:19.849 --> 03:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
um for this bill yet today which is that
 
03:44:21.410 --> 03:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
suicide is the second leading cause of
 
03:44:24.290 --> 03:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
death for individuals 10 to 34 and this
 
03:44:25.670 --> 03:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
is in the state of New Hampshire this is
 
03:44:27.830 --> 03:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
not nationally this is these are State
 
03:44:30.229 --> 03:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire stats
 
03:44:32.090 --> 03:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
um the third leading cause of death for
 
03:44:34.429 --> 03:44:34.439 align:start position:0%
individuals 35 to 44 and the fourth
 
03:44:35.929 --> 03:44:35.939 align:start position:0%
leading cause of death for individuals
 
03:44:40.210 --> 03:44:40.220 align:start position:0%
45 to 54. last year in our state we lost
 
03:44:45.469 --> 03:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
279 lives to suicide and we know that 53
 
03:44:48.110 --> 03:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
000 of our fellow Granite Staters
 
03:44:50.210 --> 03:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
contemplated suicide
 
03:44:52.370 --> 03:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
one in five adults in the U.S experience
 
03:44:56.330 --> 03:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
mental illness each year and that's 221
 
03:44:59.090 --> 03:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
000 of the the residents of New
 
03:45:01.610 --> 03:45:01.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is a significant amount
 
03:45:04.190 --> 03:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
have they have mental health conditions
 
03:45:08.030 --> 03:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
and we know that one in six U.S youth
 
03:45:11.690 --> 03:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
age 16 excuse me 6 to 17 experience of
 
03:45:13.849 --> 03:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
mental health disorder each year and we
 
03:45:14.990 --> 03:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
know that in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:45:18.229 --> 03:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
there are 15 000 youngsters that are
 
03:45:22.070 --> 03:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:24.889 --> 03:45:24.899 align:start position:0%
um as you've heard Senate Bill 85 sets
 
03:45:27.229 --> 03:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
up a framework of what the crisis system
 
03:45:29.389 --> 03:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
should look like in our state based on
 
03:45:31.610 --> 03:45:31.620 align:start position:0%
what has come down from samhsa with the
 
03:45:33.969 --> 03:45:33.979 align:start position:0%
three pillars I won't get into those
 
03:45:36.590 --> 03:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
and you've also heard some about the
 
03:45:36.600 --> 03:45:37.849 align:start position:0%
and you've also heard some about the
coverage

03:45:37.849 --> 03:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
03:45:39.349 --> 03:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
um of getting rid of the prior
 
03:45:41.330 --> 03:45:41.340 align:start position:0%
authorizations and that's something
 
03:45:43.070 --> 03:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's extremely important for parity
 
03:45:46.550 --> 03:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
because what it does is it puts
 
03:45:46.560 --> 03:45:47.990 align:start position:0%
because what it does is it puts
physical

03:45:47.990 --> 03:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
physical
 
03:45:50.150 --> 03:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
emergency services that you'd receive in
 
03:45:52.729 --> 03:45:52.739 align:start position:0%
an ER on par with
 
03:45:56.330 --> 03:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services and there is a if
 
03:45:59.690 --> 03:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:05.150 --> 03:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
page four lines 21-23 it does say under
 
03:46:07.610 --> 03:46:07.620 align:start position:0%
this chapter it says without the
 
03:46:09.530 --> 03:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
requirement of being provided in a
 
03:46:12.650 --> 03:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
licensed hospital emergency facility if
 
03:46:14.330 --> 03:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
such services are provided under the
 
03:46:17.750 --> 03:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
program established under RSA 167 colon
 
03:46:23.510 --> 03:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
3 Dash L3 that is that reference to RSA
 
03:46:27.650 --> 03:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
167 is the statute that the mobile
 
03:46:30.290 --> 03:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
crisis programs were developed under
 
03:46:32.630 --> 03:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
so so long as the services are provided
 
03:46:35.389 --> 03:46:35.399 align:start position:0%
by one of our mobile crisis teams they
 
03:46:37.790 --> 03:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
are covered regardless of whether it's
 
03:46:40.070 --> 03:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
in somebody's home or whether it's in an
 
03:46:41.510 --> 03:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
emergency room and I think that's really
 
03:46:43.849 --> 03:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
important to to consider because this
 
03:46:46.969 --> 03:46:46.979 align:start position:0%
does keep people out of the ERS
 
03:46:49.010 --> 03:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
um and I know that representative McKay
 
03:46:50.809 --> 03:46:50.819 align:start position:0%
has mentioned a few times that setting
 
03:46:53.530 --> 03:46:53.540 align:start position:0%
up the committee through the oversight
 
03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
HHS oversight and I just
 
03:46:59.809 --> 03:46:59.819 align:start position:0%
I know that with the commission if you
 
03:47:02.510 --> 03:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
read through all of the members of it
 
03:47:04.790 --> 03:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
there are people from insurance
 
03:47:07.250 --> 03:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
because we you know may be looking at a
 
03:47:09.410 --> 03:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
way for the insurers to become involved
 
03:47:10.670 --> 03:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
in this
 
03:47:12.830 --> 03:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
um and and do so on a voluntary basis
 
03:47:16.250 --> 03:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
we've got folks from the 911 system that
 
03:47:17.870 --> 03:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
are also involved in this so that we can
 
03:47:19.729 --> 03:47:19.739 align:start position:0%
maybe take a look at how that gets
 
03:47:21.469 --> 03:47:21.479 align:start position:0%
funded and whether we should be looking
 
03:47:24.530 --> 03:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
at those options so I think
 
03:47:28.070 --> 03:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
um that you know perhaps those two could
 
03:47:31.309 --> 03:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
be work in concert together I also you
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
know looking at the whole 10-year mental
 
03:47:34.610 --> 03:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
health plan is a huge chunk where we
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
know that this funding is ending in a
 
03:47:38.690 --> 03:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
couple of years making sure that we have
 
03:47:41.510 --> 03:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
a plan for sustainable funding
 
03:47:43.370 --> 03:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
when that money Runs Out is extremely
 
03:47:46.070 --> 03:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
important so with that I will end and
 
03:47:47.870 --> 03:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
03:47:50.870 --> 03:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you questions uh representative
 
03:47:50.880 --> 03:47:54.950 align:start position:0%
thank you questions uh representative
Weber

03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:58.550 --> 03:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking about the issue of what
 
03:47:59.990 --> 03:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
we can do Under the Health and Human
 
03:48:02.210 --> 03:48:02.220 align:start position:0%
Services oversight and and what we can
 
03:48:05.050 --> 03:48:05.060 align:start position:0%
do in a commission and bearing in mind
 
03:48:07.490 --> 03:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have a lot of
 
03:48:09.950 --> 03:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
commissions but also
 
03:48:09.960 --> 03:48:10.790 align:start position:0%
commissions but also
um

03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:13.309 --> 03:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
would it would I be correct in thinking
 
03:48:15.349 --> 03:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
that the difference between this and the
 
03:48:18.050 --> 03:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
oversight commission is there's actually
 
03:48:22.610 --> 03:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
a line in here on page two
 
03:48:25.250 --> 03:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the page on lines 34
 
03:48:29.830 --> 03:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
and 35 which attach this Commission
 
03:48:31.790 --> 03:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
administratively to the Department of
 
03:48:35.570 --> 03:48:35.580 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services so there there
 
03:48:40.670 --> 03:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
might be some support there that is not
 
03:48:42.590 --> 03:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
available to
 
03:48:45.110 --> 03:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh any committee or commission that's
 
03:48:47.389 --> 03:48:47.399 align:start position:0%
simply a a subdivision of something
 
03:48:50.809 --> 03:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
created by the legislature
 
03:48:52.790 --> 03:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
if you know if that's outside your area
 
03:48:55.130 --> 03:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
of expertise that's fine my area of the
 
03:48:56.630 --> 03:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
expertise but I do know the Department's
 
03:48:58.550 --> 03:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
still here so they might be able to pop
 
03:49:00.650 --> 03:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
up and answer that question for you okay
 
03:49:04.190 --> 03:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
I hope they will thank you
 
03:49:06.790 --> 03:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
03:49:09.410 --> 03:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:49:10.610 --> 03:49:10.620 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
03:49:13.309 --> 03:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
in regards to
 
03:49:15.889 --> 03:49:15.899 align:start position:0%
treatment of Mental Health
 
03:49:17.690 --> 03:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
what's not addressed here maybe it
 
03:49:19.550 --> 03:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be
 
03:49:21.650 --> 03:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
my concern is we don't want to overlook
 
03:49:21.660 --> 03:49:23.630 align:start position:0%
my concern is we don't want to overlook
it

03:49:23.630 --> 03:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:49:26.510 --> 03:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
can you speak to Telehealth and the use
 
03:49:28.130 --> 03:49:28.140 align:start position:0%
of Telehealth versus it being done
 
03:49:30.110 --> 03:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
physically because a lot of times
 
03:49:31.670 --> 03:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
if I understand it correctly getting
 
03:49:34.910 --> 03:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
somebody to a provider is critical and
 
03:49:37.370 --> 03:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's hard to find providers
 
03:49:39.290 --> 03:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
that readily available yet we could have
 
03:49:42.050 --> 03:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
a pool of providers that could do things
 
03:49:43.550 --> 03:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
through Telehealth that they couldn't do
 
03:49:43.560 --> 03:49:48.290 align:start position:0%
through Telehealth that they couldn't do
physically

03:49:48.290 --> 03:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:50.809 --> 03:49:50.819 align:start position:0%
crisis system itself which is the phone
 
03:49:54.410 --> 03:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
calls that folks receive for support and
 
03:49:56.630 --> 03:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
the mobile crisis teams that go to where
 
03:49:58.130 --> 03:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
the people are
 
03:50:00.469 --> 03:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
and it's when they need them whether
 
03:50:01.849 --> 03:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
that's three in the morning whether
 
03:50:04.790 --> 03:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's on the weekend so I think the
 
03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
issue with not having providers
 
03:50:10.429 --> 03:50:10.439 align:start position:0%
available to go to somebody
 
03:50:13.790 --> 03:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
um isn't as prevalent in this model
 
03:50:15.830 --> 03:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
because the whole crisis system is built
 
03:50:17.809 --> 03:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
on the mobile crisis team being able to
 
03:50:19.550 --> 03:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
go out and respond where they're needed
 
03:50:22.910 --> 03:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:26.330 --> 03:50:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:35.750 --> 03:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:39.170 --> 03:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is and I applied
 
03:50:41.570 --> 03:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
my best for the last name Alex fedrebel
 
03:50:46.910 --> 03:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:48.469 --> 03:50:48.479 align:start position:0%
how did I do
 
03:50:51.110 --> 03:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
pretty good okay with the name I mean
 
03:50:51.120 --> 03:50:53.269 align:start position:0%
pretty good okay with the name I mean
yes

03:50:53.269 --> 03:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:50:55.130 --> 03:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman my name is Alex
 
03:50:57.889 --> 03:50:57.899 align:start position:0%
valve I'm uh an examiner from the
 
03:51:00.110 --> 03:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
insurance department and uh my part of
 
03:51:01.849 --> 03:51:01.859 align:start position:0%
my responsibility is cover Healthcare
 
03:51:04.969 --> 03:51:04.979 align:start position:0%
issues with the legislature
 
03:51:04.979 --> 03:51:06.290 align:start position:0%
issues with the legislature
and

03:51:06.290 --> 03:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:08.809 --> 03:51:08.819 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to make myself available
 
03:51:11.450 --> 03:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
because the insurance department was
 
03:51:13.570 --> 03:51:13.580 align:start position:0%
raised in the
 
03:51:17.510 --> 03:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
discussion so far but let me just take a
 
03:51:19.370 --> 03:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
minute to try to answer some of the
 
03:51:21.769 --> 03:51:21.779 align:start position:0%
questions that have come up or reinforce
 
03:51:25.210 --> 03:51:25.220 align:start position:0%
the answers that have already been given
 
03:51:28.370 --> 03:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
the language at the end of the bill
 
03:51:30.130 --> 03:51:30.140 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
03:51:33.170 --> 03:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
the statute that governs coverage for
 
03:51:36.729 --> 03:51:36.739 align:start position:0%
emergency Health Care Services
 
03:51:39.469 --> 03:51:39.479 align:start position:0%
with respect to commercial insurance
 
03:51:43.309 --> 03:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
carriers and what is going on here is
 
03:51:45.410 --> 03:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
we're incorporating into that definition
 
03:51:50.469 --> 03:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:52.849 --> 03:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
community-based Mental Health crisis
 
03:51:56.510 --> 03:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
intervention services and the effect of
 
03:51:59.030 --> 03:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
that is first of all to eliminate any
 
03:52:01.190 --> 03:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
prior authorization because it has
 
03:52:03.769 --> 03:52:03.779 align:start position:0%
already been a part of the law governing
 
03:52:06.349 --> 03:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services is that there's no
 
03:52:08.389 --> 03:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
such thing as prior authorization for
 
03:52:11.389 --> 03:52:11.399 align:start position:0%
emergency care so that's how that part
 
03:52:13.849 --> 03:52:13.859 align:start position:0%
of it works by bringing community-based
 
03:52:15.170 --> 03:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services into the
 
03:52:17.809 --> 03:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
definition of Emergency Services you
 
03:52:20.150 --> 03:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
eliminate the this issue of prior
 
03:52:20.160 --> 03:52:21.710 align:start position:0%
eliminate the this issue of prior
authorization

03:52:21.710 --> 03:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
03:52:24.410 --> 03:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
and then secondly there were some
 
03:52:26.330 --> 03:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
questions about maintaining the
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
community nature of these crisis
 
03:52:31.849 --> 03:52:31.859 align:start position:0%
intervention services and that was an
 
03:52:31.859 --> 03:52:32.929 align:start position:0%
intervention services and that was an
issue

03:52:32.929 --> 03:52:32.939 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:52:36.530 --> 03:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
um with the prior definition of
 
03:52:38.990 --> 03:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services because it referred
 
03:52:42.710 --> 03:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
to a hospital-based services so we added
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
additional language and I helped myself
 
03:52:47.750 --> 03:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
with this amendment here
 
03:52:47.760 --> 03:52:48.650 align:start position:0%
with this amendment here
um

03:52:48.650 --> 03:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:50.450 --> 03:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
that made it clear that even though the
 
03:52:52.030 --> 03:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
services are offered in the community
 
03:52:55.190 --> 03:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
they can still qualify as Emergency
 
03:53:00.170 --> 03:53:00.180 align:start position:0%
Services Under this insurance law
 
03:53:03.050 --> 03:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
so long as they're sponsored by this
 
03:53:05.809 --> 03:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
program that's referenced that the Holly
 
03:53:09.050 --> 03:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
Stevens reference for you on line 23 of
 
03:53:10.429 --> 03:53:10.439 align:start position:0%
page four
 
03:53:12.950 --> 03:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
so that's how it works and that's why
 
03:53:15.410 --> 03:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
this language is here and I'd be happy
 
03:53:17.450 --> 03:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
to answer any other questions for you
 
03:53:21.229 --> 03:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
03:53:23.090 --> 03:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
03:53:27.170 --> 03:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm not sure since
 
03:53:30.110 --> 03:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
you said that any any service I think
 
03:53:31.130 --> 03:53:31.140 align:start position:0%
you said
 
03:53:33.170 --> 03:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
um correct me if I'm wrong any service
 
03:53:33.180 --> 03:53:34.309 align:start position:0%
um correct me if I'm wrong any service
that's

03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:53:34.319 --> 03:53:36.290 align:start position:0%
that's
um

03:53:36.290 --> 03:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:38.269 --> 03:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
that falls under Emergency Services
 
03:53:41.150 --> 03:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
already excludes
 
03:53:45.229 --> 03:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
um prior auth authorizations yeah so is
 
03:53:48.530 --> 03:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
this bill saying that they
 
03:53:50.150 --> 03:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
that it's going to exclude prior
 
03:53:51.769 --> 03:53:51.779 align:start position:0%
authorizations is it real is it
 
03:53:53.870 --> 03:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
redundant in some way I guess it's like
 
03:53:56.210 --> 03:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
no I think it's the most efficient way
 
03:53:58.990 --> 03:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
to exclude prior authorization
 
03:54:01.729 --> 03:54:01.739 align:start position:0%
requirements for these crisis
 
03:54:03.650 --> 03:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
intervention services is to include them
 
03:54:07.190 --> 03:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
in the definition of Emergency Services
 
03:54:09.410 --> 03:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
follow one more question
 
03:54:09.420 --> 03:54:10.429 align:start position:0%
follow one more question
um

03:54:10.429 --> 03:54:10.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:13.070 --> 03:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to speed ahead and do the
 
03:54:16.370 --> 03:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
work of the commission but
 
03:54:21.410 --> 03:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:23.570 --> 03:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
you know answering services that take
 
03:54:25.309 --> 03:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
initial calls
 
03:54:28.189 --> 03:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
um are those ever reimbursable Services
 
03:54:31.189 --> 03:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
Under Telehealth and might that will be
 
03:54:36.110 --> 03:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
a way to fund programs like this
 
03:54:36.120 --> 03:54:37.250 align:start position:0%
a way to fund programs like this
um

03:54:37.250 --> 03:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:40.010 --> 03:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
I only speak to commercial health
 
03:54:42.889 --> 03:54:42.899 align:start position:0%
insurance and I don't believe that
 
03:54:42.899 --> 03:54:44.090 align:start position:0%
insurance and I don't believe that
original

03:54:44.090 --> 03:54:44.100 align:start position:0%
original
 
03:54:47.929 --> 03:54:47.939 align:start position:0%
answering service is is billed as a part
 
03:54:51.050 --> 03:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
of Emergency Services because big
 
03:54:53.030 --> 03:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up because I think they're
 
03:54:54.650 --> 03:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
staffed by
 
03:54:56.929 --> 03:54:56.939 align:start position:0%
at least I believe their staff by
 
03:54:56.939 --> 03:54:58.130 align:start position:0%
at least I believe their staff by
clinical

03:54:58.130 --> 03:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
clinical
 
03:54:58.140 --> 03:54:58.910 align:start position:0%
clinical
um

03:54:58.910 --> 03:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:01.070 --> 03:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
providers but in any case that doesn't
 
03:55:03.469 --> 03:55:03.479 align:start position:0%
really apply to the bill so uh
 
03:55:03.479 --> 03:55:06.490 align:start position:0%
really apply to the bill so uh
um

03:55:06.490 --> 03:55:06.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:08.990 --> 03:55:09.000 align:start position:0%

03:56:01.010 --> 03:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
old daughter
 
03:56:05.450 --> 03:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
and she became her mental health Journey
 
03:56:09.590 --> 03:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
when she was six we found out when she
 
03:56:12.670 --> 03:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
was nine that she was diagnosed with
 
03:56:16.849 --> 03:56:16.859 align:start position:0%
Lyme disease and it completely changed
 
03:56:19.610 --> 03:56:19.620 align:start position:0%
her personality from six to nine to the
 
03:56:22.189 --> 03:56:22.199 align:start position:0%
point where she had extreme anxiety she
 
03:56:23.929 --> 03:56:23.939 align:start position:0%
would have Tantrums we would have to
 
03:56:26.349 --> 03:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
pull over in the car and let her out
 
03:56:29.469 --> 03:56:29.479 align:start position:0%
when she was nine
 
03:56:32.630 --> 03:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
we got to the point where we had to
 
03:56:36.650 --> 03:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
call police and EMTs and bring her for
 
03:56:39.050 --> 03:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
her first hospitalization when she was
 
03:56:43.729 --> 03:56:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:45.050 --> 03:56:45.060 align:start position:0%
she was there
 
03:56:50.229 --> 03:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
for three days and I was there with her
 
03:56:52.550 --> 03:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
She was transferred to New Hampshire
 
03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
State Hospital
 
03:56:56.630 --> 03:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
and over the course of the next two
 
03:57:00.650 --> 03:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
months she was discharged and then
 
03:57:03.349 --> 03:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
placed back into crisis
 
03:57:03.359 --> 03:57:04.189 align:start position:0%
placed back into crisis
um

03:57:04.189 --> 03:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:07.969 --> 03:57:07.979 align:start position:0%
two more times so it was 63 days total
 
03:57:09.830 --> 03:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
and she spent about 35 of those days
 
03:57:12.349 --> 03:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
either in the emergency room
 
03:57:15.950 --> 03:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
or in New Hampshire hospital
 
03:57:18.710 --> 03:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
two years ago she's had two more
 
03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations over in Hampstead
 
03:57:21.120 --> 03:57:23.030 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations over in Hampstead
Hospital

03:57:23.030 --> 03:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
Hospital
 
03:57:28.490 --> 03:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:30.590 --> 03:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
um she was started struggling from
 
03:57:33.889 --> 03:57:33.899 align:start position:0%
severe PTSD from her experiences at
 
03:57:37.370 --> 03:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
inpatient hospitals and emergency rooms
 
03:57:37.380 --> 03:57:38.510 align:start position:0%
inpatient hospitals and emergency rooms
um

03:57:38.510 --> 03:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:40.670 --> 03:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
to the point where thinking about taking
 
03:57:42.170 --> 03:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
her to the emergency room was a trauma
 
03:57:42.180 --> 03:57:46.910 align:start position:0%
her to the emergency room was a trauma
response

03:57:46.910 --> 03:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:49.610 --> 03:57:49.620 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic as we know when she
 
03:57:52.070 --> 03:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
was 11 we were in the emergency room for
 
03:57:53.269 --> 03:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
three weeks
 
03:57:55.670 --> 03:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
I was living with her for three weeks in
 
03:57:57.410 --> 03:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
the emergency room
 
03:57:57.420 --> 03:57:58.550 align:start position:0%
the emergency room
um

03:57:58.550 --> 03:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:58.560 --> 03:57:59.750 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:57:59.750 --> 03:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:58:03.290 --> 03:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
she had no access to a shower she had no
 
03:58:05.570 --> 03:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
interaction with anyone but me
 
03:58:08.389 --> 03:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
and I watched while she was physically
 
03:58:14.750 --> 03:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:19.729 --> 03:58:19.739 align:start position:0%
after that placement we placed her into
 
03:58:22.130 --> 03:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
a voluntary residential
 
03:58:25.550 --> 03:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
because the need was just
 
03:58:25.560 --> 03:58:27.050 align:start position:0%
because the need was just
um

03:58:27.050 --> 03:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:29.030 --> 03:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
was too much
 
03:58:30.889 --> 03:58:30.899 align:start position:0%
um I actually quit my job
 
03:58:30.899 --> 03:58:32.269 align:start position:0%
um I actually quit my job
before

03:58:32.269 --> 03:58:32.279 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:58:34.490 --> 03:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
we placed her residential because she
 
03:58:36.849 --> 03:58:36.859 align:start position:0%
needed so much services
 
03:58:41.510 --> 03:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:41.520 --> 03:58:43.610 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:58:43.610 --> 03:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:46.490 --> 03:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
she came out of residential after a year
 
03:58:49.189 --> 03:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
a completely different person
 
03:58:52.490 --> 03:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
she was I'd say 80 back to who she is
 
03:58:54.189 --> 03:58:54.199 align:start position:0%
who she was
 
03:58:57.050 --> 03:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
except for the trauma piece that was
 
03:58:57.060 --> 03:58:59.389 align:start position:0%
except for the trauma piece that was
unaddressed

03:58:59.389 --> 03:58:59.399 align:start position:0%
unaddressed
 
03:58:59.399 --> 03:59:00.590 align:start position:0%
unaddressed
about

03:59:00.590 --> 03:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:59:02.750 --> 03:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
four weeks ago
 
03:59:02.760 --> 03:59:04.910 align:start position:0%
four weeks ago
um

03:59:04.910 --> 03:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:07.550 --> 03:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
well let me back up a moment but
 
03:59:10.309 --> 03:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
probably in November she started having
 
03:59:10.319 --> 03:59:10.910 align:start position:0%
probably in November she started having
um

03:59:10.910 --> 03:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:14.269 --> 03:59:14.279 align:start position:0%
regressing with trauma and I had to call
 
03:59:17.450 --> 03:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
988 twice over the past four months
 
03:59:19.070 --> 03:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
and if I can speak to what
 
03:59:21.349 --> 03:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro said
 
03:59:21.359 --> 03:59:21.950 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro said
um

03:59:21.950 --> 03:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:24.170 --> 03:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
you get a
 
03:59:28.490 --> 03:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:28.500 --> 03:59:30.290 align:start position:0%
 
state

03:59:30.290 --> 03:59:30.300 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:59:33.830 --> 03:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:37.729 --> 03:59:37.739 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately I had to drive her to
 
03:59:40.010 --> 03:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
our community mental health agency and
 
03:59:41.870 --> 03:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
sit in the parking lot and wait for
 
03:59:44.750 --> 03:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
about two hours to find out that no one
 
03:59:46.729 --> 03:59:46.739 align:start position:0%
was coming from mobile crisis because
 
03:59:49.969 --> 03:59:49.979 align:start position:0%
there was no availability of anybody
 
03:59:52.670 --> 03:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
so I was able to contact her therapist
 
03:59:55.490 --> 03:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
and drive her down for uh another
 
03:59:55.500 --> 03:59:59.530 align:start position:0%
and drive her down for uh another
appointment

03:59:59.530 --> 03:59:59.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:02.150 --> 04:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
another thing I'd like to comment as is
 
04:00:04.670 --> 04:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
when she began this journey
 
04:00:08.210 --> 04:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
I took her off my private insurance
 
04:00:11.630 --> 04:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
I could not access what she needed she
 
04:00:14.389 --> 04:00:14.399 align:start position:0%
needed home supports and the only way I
 
04:00:15.469 --> 04:00:15.479 align:start position:0%
could do that through our community
 
04:00:18.110 --> 04:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
mental health department is on Medicaid
 
04:00:20.990 --> 04:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
so I took her off of my insurance and
 
04:00:23.450 --> 04:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
put her on Medicaid
 
04:00:25.729 --> 04:00:25.739 align:start position:0%
when I quit my job we lost our insurance
 
04:00:35.570 --> 04:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:38.630 --> 04:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
so she is back because of her trauma and
 
04:00:41.330 --> 04:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
some of the facilities in on in New
 
04:00:41.340 --> 04:00:42.590 align:start position:0%
some of the facilities in on in New
Hampshire

04:00:42.590 --> 04:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:00:45.349 --> 04:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
um we placed her directly in a
 
04:00:47.750 --> 04:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
community-based acute treatment program
 
04:00:49.090 --> 04:00:49.100 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts
 
04:00:51.889 --> 04:00:51.899 align:start position:0%
this past time from a week in the
 
04:00:53.170 --> 04:00:53.180 align:start position:0%
emergency room
 
04:00:54.950 --> 04:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
directly there
 
04:00:57.170 --> 04:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
the funding source is through the Bureau
 
04:00:59.630 --> 04:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
of children's and Behavioral Health that
 
04:01:01.610 --> 04:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
I had to call personally and request
 
04:01:08.229 --> 04:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:11.030 --> 04:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
just over
 
04:01:13.429 --> 04:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
right now we're currently she's she's in
 
04:01:15.830 --> 04:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
the cbat program and we are working on
 
04:01:17.809 --> 04:01:17.819 align:start position:0%
finding her an intensive trauma
 
04:01:20.030 --> 04:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
treatment placement that will most
 
04:01:22.910 --> 04:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
likely be out of state
 
04:01:24.590 --> 04:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
um but over the six years that we've
 
04:01:27.170 --> 04:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
been working with this
 
04:01:29.090 --> 04:01:29.100 align:start position:0%
um I have researched every organization
 
04:01:30.769 --> 04:01:30.779 align:start position:0%
and Department I have made phone calls
 
04:01:32.389 --> 04:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
I've speak into I've spoken to some of
 
04:01:33.830 --> 04:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
the Senators here
 
04:01:36.410 --> 04:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
to get access for mental health for her
 
04:01:38.210 --> 04:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
and I've discovered that a lot of the
 
04:01:41.330 --> 04:01:41.340 align:start position:0%
providers in the area do not take the
 
04:01:41.340 --> 04:01:42.229 align:start position:0%
providers in the area do not take the
insurance

04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:01:46.189 --> 04:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
either my private or now Medicaid
 
04:01:49.130 --> 04:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
because of the low reimbursement rates
 
04:01:52.130 --> 04:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
I've discovered that we've had a lot of
 
04:01:54.110 --> 04:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
Staff turn over in a lot of our
 
04:01:55.969 --> 04:01:55.979 align:start position:0%
therapies and even in our community
 
04:01:59.150 --> 04:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
mental health providers I'd say once a
 
04:02:01.790 --> 04:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
year they change because of decreased
 
04:02:04.550 --> 04:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
staff pay
 
04:02:07.550 --> 04:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
and I've had to become her case manager
 
04:02:09.530 --> 04:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
her social worker
 
04:02:11.809 --> 04:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
her teacher her therapist and I've never
 
04:02:14.150 --> 04:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
been able to just be her mom
 
04:02:15.889 --> 04:02:15.899 align:start position:0%
I've had to work so hard to get her what
 
04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
she needs
 
04:02:20.030 --> 04:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
and I believe in the mobile crisis unit
 
04:02:22.490 --> 04:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm asking for this committee to
 
04:02:26.510 --> 04:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
to push through SB 85 I think New
 
04:02:28.670 --> 04:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is beginning their journey in
 
04:02:29.929 --> 04:02:29.939 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
04:02:32.510 --> 04:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
and I think making sure there's more
 
04:02:35.689 --> 04:02:35.699 align:start position:0%
crisis mobile crisis units in the state
 
04:02:38.570 --> 04:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
will increase the ability to get to
 
04:02:43.010 --> 04:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:44.870 --> 04:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
and I know just recently we've had to
 
04:02:47.030 --> 04:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
call the police and the EMTs
 
04:02:49.670 --> 04:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
to come in and assist us when she has
 
04:02:54.410 --> 04:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:56.990 --> 04:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
and I think that there are limited
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
options right now for the community
 
04:03:02.210 --> 04:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
supports and especially the Intensive
 
04:03:04.729 --> 04:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
supports that children like my daughter
 
04:03:04.739 --> 04:03:06.229 align:start position:0%
supports that children like my daughter
need

04:03:06.229 --> 04:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
need
 
04:03:06.239 --> 04:03:06.889 align:start position:0%
need
um

04:03:06.889 --> 04:03:06.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:08.689 --> 04:03:08.699 align:start position:0%
it's almost over and above what the
 
04:03:10.070 --> 04:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
community-based mental health can
 
04:03:10.080 --> 04:03:12.229 align:start position:0%
community-based mental health can
provide

04:03:12.229 --> 04:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
provide
 
04:03:14.809 --> 04:03:14.819 align:start position:0%
so just focusing on the preventive
 
04:03:16.670 --> 04:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
measure and really looking at how to
 
04:03:18.530 --> 04:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
fund and keep
 
04:03:18.540 --> 04:03:19.790 align:start position:0%
fund and keep
um

04:03:19.790 --> 04:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:23.210 --> 04:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
988 going and Crisis Support going in
 
04:03:24.769 --> 04:03:24.779 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
04:03:25.969 --> 04:03:25.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:27.650 --> 04:03:27.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:29.450 --> 04:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members yes
 
04:03:31.490 --> 04:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
04:03:33.950 --> 04:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you very much for your
 
04:03:37.370 --> 04:03:37.380 align:start position:0%
presentation I really appreciate that um
 
04:03:39.530 --> 04:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
this may be a hard question to ask and
 
04:03:40.910 --> 04:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
if you don't want to answer it it's fine
 
04:03:42.889 --> 04:03:42.899 align:start position:0%
that's fine you said something that
 
04:03:45.530 --> 04:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
really touched something in me you said
 
04:03:49.309 --> 04:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
um PTSD from experiences and
 
04:03:51.950 --> 04:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
places that were designed to help her
 
04:03:56.090 --> 04:03:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:03.650 --> 04:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:06.229 --> 04:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
during one of her three
 
04:04:07.969 --> 04:04:07.979 align:start position:0%
little somehow she was sexually
 
04:04:07.979 --> 04:04:09.110 align:start position:0%
little somehow she was sexually
assaulted

04:04:09.110 --> 04:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
assaulted
 
04:04:13.070 --> 04:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:16.729 --> 04:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
a current investigation that's going on
 
04:04:19.309 --> 04:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
but we're not sure but that
 
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
that brought her
 
04:04:23.929 --> 04:04:23.939 align:start position:0%
to where she is now really sorry I'm
 
04:04:27.769 --> 04:04:27.779 align:start position:0%
sorry I brought that up but so now
 
04:04:29.389 --> 04:04:29.399 align:start position:0%
and because
 
04:04:34.250 --> 04:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:35.929 --> 04:04:35.939 align:start position:0%
we can't place her anywhere in New
 
04:04:37.550 --> 04:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because I don't feel like
 
04:04:40.309 --> 04:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:40.319 --> 04:04:41.090 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:04:41.090 --> 04:04:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:45.590 --> 04:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:48.349 --> 04:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
and we do everything we can to make our
 
04:04:48.359 --> 04:04:49.610 align:start position:0%
and we do everything we can to make our
home

04:04:49.610 --> 04:04:49.620 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:04:53.750 --> 04:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
as safe as possible with
 
04:04:55.550 --> 04:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
locking up Sharps cameras in every
 
04:04:59.030 --> 04:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
single room interior door locks
 
04:04:59.040 --> 04:05:00.170 align:start position:0%
single room interior door locks
um

04:05:00.170 --> 04:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:04.070 --> 04:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:04.080 --> 04:05:05.689 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:05:05.689 --> 04:05:05.699 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:08.450 --> 04:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
lime brought us here and then her
 
04:05:09.769 --> 04:05:09.779 align:start position:0%
experience has brought us to where we
 
04:05:12.650 --> 04:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:17.090 --> 04:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:19.849 --> 04:05:19.859 align:start position:0%
I guess it is
 
04:05:22.250 --> 04:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
so important to fund mental health
 
04:05:24.889 --> 04:05:24.899 align:start position:0%
because you never know
 
04:05:27.170 --> 04:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
who or when or where
 
04:05:29.809 --> 04:05:29.819 align:start position:0%
and I'm a pediatric OT
 
04:05:29.819 --> 04:05:31.610 align:start position:0%
and I'm a pediatric OT
and

04:05:31.610 --> 04:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know I
 
04:05:35.330 --> 04:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
did whatever I could
 
04:05:38.510 --> 04:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
but it's just over my
 
04:05:40.189 --> 04:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
experience now
 
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:05:43.969 --> 04:05:43.979 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:48.650 --> 04:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions thank you
 
04:05:52.250 --> 04:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
no one else has signed up to testify
 
04:05:56.330 --> 04:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
does anyone else want to testify on
 
04:05:59.090 --> 04:05:59.100 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 85.
 
04:06:01.250 --> 04:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
seeing no one I will close the public
 
04:06:04.250 --> 04:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate bill 85. that is the
 
04:06:06.170 --> 04:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
last piece of legislation we had a
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
notice for hearing today
 
04:06:09.830 --> 04:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
so we are adjourned for the day we will
 
04:06:35.990 --> 04:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:06:40.729 --> 04:06:40.739 align:start position:0%
Lucy you're not going to have that that
