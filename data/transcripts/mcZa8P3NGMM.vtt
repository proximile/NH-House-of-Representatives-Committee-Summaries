00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 align:start position:0%
I open the work session on the special
 
00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
committee on the Family Division of the
 
00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.869 align:start position:0%

court

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
and as you know and for the record we
 
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
had presumably finished our work last
 
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
couple of three months ago we looked at
 
00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 align:start position:0%
four different items and uh came to some
 
00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
good conclusions we enjoyed buyin from
 
00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 align:start position:0%
the Jud Judiciary in part because they
 
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
helped us along the way or we help them
 
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
and the speaker wondered if we were done
 
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
would we submit our final report and I
 
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
suggested to the speaker that it be the
 
00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 align:start position:0%
interim report and that we stay open as
 
00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
a special committee until the end of
 
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
this legislative term or at least
 
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.030 align:start position:0%
this legislative term or at least
October

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
October
 
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
31st and the reason for that is we I
 
00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
assume there might just be some items
 
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
that we hadn't thought of that somebody
 
00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
else would think of down the road that
 
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate for us to look at
 
00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
and in the event four things
 
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
emerged uh two things had been assigned
 
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
to the special committee on the
 
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 align:start position:0%
DCF that the speaker's office and I
 
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
think rightly so decided were better
 
00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
placed with us second uh the the third
 
00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 align:start position:0%
item is I I don't know how it came to us
 
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
but the third item is on the agenda here
 
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
and the fourth one was submitted by
 
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.069 align:start position:0%
and the fourth one was submitted by
representative

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
Greg so what I plan on doing and you've
 
00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
all been sent emails and you all have
 
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
hard copy in front of you is to go
 
00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 align:start position:0%
through each one of these
 
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
items and see if there is sufficient
 
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
interest to form a subcommittee
 
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh we do not have all of our members
 
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
here but if we as the group of people
 
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
who are present think there's
 
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
Merit uh I will communicate then with
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
those who are not here and see if they
 
00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.270 align:start position:0%
those who are not here and see if they
are

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
interested and if there is sufficient
 
00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
interest we will make this a
 
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I will appoint a chair to
 
00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:53.909 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I will appoint a chair to
that

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
subcomittee and of course
 
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
91a rules apply uh uh you may not have a
 
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
meeting of a majority of the members of
 
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.469 align:start position:0%
meeting of a majority of the members of
the

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee unless it is advertised in
 
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
calendar uh held in the public place
 
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
which rules out this building for July
 
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.270 align:start position:0%
which rules out this building for July
and

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
August also you cannot have a private
 
00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 align:start position:0%
meeting with more than a majority of
 
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
people to discuss it anywhere
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
have a one-on-one discussion with
 
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
another member of the subcommittee if it
 
00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
is a large subcommittee perhaps it could
 
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
even be three people discussed but it
 
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
has to be more than
 
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
50% you can bring have a conversation
 
00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 align:start position:0%

um why would it be this committee that
 
00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
would be the best
 
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
place to look into oh and we have in
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
terms of legislative Committees of
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
course we have Finance why would it be
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
this committee that we
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
would go to representative Lynn yeah you
 
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
know my understanding I may be
 
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
completely wrong on this but my
 
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:0%
understanding and I
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
believe it was from discussions with
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative couta but I could be
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
wrong is that apparently there has been
 
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
some claim
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
that because of the federal funding that
 
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
is provided to the office of child
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
support enforcement
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
in DC in uh the Department of Health and
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
Human Services that that
 
00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
somehow causes that office to be more
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
aggressive I guess is it would be the
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
the if I'm the right word more
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
aggressive than it should be in in in
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
enfor ing child support obligations that
 
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:35.079 align:start position:0%
that as I understand that's the claim um
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'm you know it's been quite a while
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
since I did Child Support Enforcement
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
stuff but when I was doing it it was the
 
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
D dcyf was getting I mean the Department
 
00:11:47.069 --> 00:11:47.079 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services were
 
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
getting Federal funding for that I never
 
00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:52.279 align:start position:0%
had any sense that that was causing DC
 
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
to act in some way that it wouldn't have
 
00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:56.959 align:start position:0%
acted otherwise but you know maybe I'm
 
00:11:58.990 --> 00:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
wrong on that that but anyway that's my
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
understanding of the claim I I have I'm
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
skeptical that there's anything to the
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
claim but that's what I understand the
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
claim to be but Mr chair if I could
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
follow up on that
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
even whether you're skeptical or not
 
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
claim I don't think we have to uh reach
 
00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
determination on that I think that this
 
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
is a matter that
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
belongs um elsewhere it belongs in
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
it belongs in um the legislative budget
 
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
analysis it belongs in uh
 
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.610 align:start position:0%
analysis it belongs in uh

don't I I I don't see and no one has yet
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
said anything that would
 
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.670 align:start position:0%
said anything that would
indicate

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
indicate
 
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
why how much money is collected and from
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
whom and what belongs in the family
 
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
court and I won't I won't belabor the
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
issue it might just be that I'm a slow
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
learner but um and I wouldn't argue with
 
00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
that I just don't say it belongs here
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
attorney krian I think I heard you
 
00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:15.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
Court yes sir um in so far as title four
 
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
deals with tanif and Foster families it
 
00:13:25.629 --> 00:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
is money that is going to DHHS it is
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
only child support uh funding that is
 
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
collected and reimburse to the court
 
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
system for those who work on those
 
00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:36.519 align:start position:0%
issues we can get about 66 out of $100
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
for that time if we submit time logs to
 
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
DHHS who then submits them to the
 
00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
federal government um it's it's a
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
not insignificant amount of money but
 
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:48.519 align:start position:0%
it's a small percentage of the overall
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
running budget of the Circuit Court um
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
and there is absolutely no impact on the
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
Judgment of Child Support referees or
 
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
judges that is both statutory and a
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
requirement of due process so would it
 
00:14:04.269 --> 00:14:04.279 align:start position:0%
be your conclusion that there is some
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
narrowly focused warrant for this
 
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
committee to look at title 4
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
subd I don't want to weigh in on your
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
debate but I Ford would be the only part
 
00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:17.759 align:start position:0%
in which the courts would have a role as
 
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to DHHS okay so yes
 
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.389 align:start position:0%
opposed to DHHS okay so yes

00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:24.519 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman parison I'm
 
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
sorry to keep raising my hand just a
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
clarification um
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
I believe that when we were originally
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
talking about this the concern that was
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
being brought forward to us was from um
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
people who came to
 
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
testify that they were not aware that
 
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
they did not have to participate in the
 
00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
program and so they were participating
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
in a program where they actually didn't
 
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
need to they didn't they could have just
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
made payments on their own without going
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
through the program or am I I could be
 
00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
mixing this up with something but that's
 
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
how I um that's how I believe people who
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
came testify said that they weren't
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
given the option not to participate and
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
that they were not aware that they had
 
00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:07.350 align:start position:0%
that they were not aware that they had
that

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
option I'm not certain what that
 
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
individual person's circumstances are I
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
will say that if you are a TANF or
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid recipient I I think that in
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
order to receive those benefits you
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
typically do have to go through this
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
program and that is the most frequent
 
00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:22.519 align:start position:0%
user of it although there can be some
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
others that decide to use the process
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
because it can be more convenient for
 
00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
them but those would be off topic to us
 
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
those are programs that are administered
 
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
long thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:15:41.069 --> 00:15:41.079 align:start position:0%
so without being involved in
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
tanif um if my spouse and I agreed not
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
to go through this is that not to go
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
through uh the division of child
 
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
support is that historically with the
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
courts okayed or uh do they still
 
00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
have you go through Child Support
 
00:16:02.319 --> 00:16:03.870 align:start position:0%
have you go through Child Support
Division

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
Division
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
the title title 4D imposes certain
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
obligations on the court system to for
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
example block schedule all of the all of
 
00:16:13.949 --> 00:16:13.959 align:start position:0%
the referrals through the Bureau of
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
Child Support Services but um the laws
 
00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are not markedly
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
different outside that administrative
 
00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:23.959 align:start position:0%
aspect of it so I I don't know that it
 
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
you would not be necessarily in that
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
block scheduling where you have multiple
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Child Support claims being
 
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
brought one one after the other but it
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
might not make a big difference to the
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
underlying case although I think if
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
you're if your non-cohabitating parent
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
is a TANF recipient then they have to
 
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
show that they've done their due
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
diligence to assign that claim over so
 
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
if if you're not participants in those
 
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
programs your the legal standards on
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
child support may still apply but you're
 
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
you're probably not going to be block
 
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
scheduled with one of these cases which
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
is multiple um Bureau of Child Support
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
Services claims one after the other okay
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
you based on what we've heard if there's
 
00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
no further questions about whether a
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
very narrow subset of
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
this is an appropriate subject for this
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
uh Who present would like to serve on
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
such a
 
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh representative katab has
 
00:17:24.189 --> 00:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
already indicated to me she would like
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
to is there anyone else representative
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:39.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
know okay there's three and I will put
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
this question to the members who are not
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
present to see if there's anyone else
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
and based on that um we may or may not
 
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
uh constitute this as a
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh stay tuned
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
item two also passed on to us from the
 
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
speaker's office originally this had
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
gone on to the special committee on DCF
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
but it was deemed more appropriate to
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
come to us and this is to address
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
potential ways to address perjury you
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
may remember both in some of you in
 
00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
children and family law and all of us in
 
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
this committee uh except for
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn we had numbers of
 
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
people who uh alleged
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh opponents in various trials were
 
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
committing perjury and therefore the
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
judge was
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
remiss and not knowing that and dealing
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
accordingly this question did come up a
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
lot um allegations we heard from numbers
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
of people were that person was lying and
 
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
I can prove
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
it well okay what should happen next if
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
somebody make makes that allegation to
 
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:05.240 align:start position:0%
what degree should Family Court be
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
required or strong strongly suggested to
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
go to the next step you believe there is
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
perjury we certainly want the whole
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
truth nothing but so what do we do uh
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
again attorney krian anything from
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
Judiciary that you might like to say I
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
know you're going to do a wonderful job
 
00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:28.039 align:start position:0%
with whatever we come up with but uh
 
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
anything from your are
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
end my pleasure to be helpful to you if
 
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
I am I hope that I am um I can say for
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
for perjury it's of course a criminal
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
offense it has to be investigated and
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
prosecuted by the executive branch um I
 
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
have had by the which branch the
 
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
Executive Branch the that unimportant
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
branch that isn't here right now uh
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
isn't represented here watching they're
 
00:19:55.149 --> 00:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I think they certainly are
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
watching well I'll apologize later um
 
00:20:00.029 --> 00:20:00.039 align:start position:0%
strike that from the record okay go
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you um so there's not a
 
00:20:05.149 --> 00:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
major role for the court system of
 
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
course unless they hear the perjury case
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
later when it's brought for um a
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
criminal trial which would be in
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
Superior Court it's a class B felony
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
um I do certainly and and I'm sure you
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
do the same when you talk with
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
constituents if they feel as though they
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
have proofs that would meet the
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Doubt standard or that it
 
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
could be gathered to to make sure that
 
00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:27.559 align:start position:0%
that's investigated I think the
 
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
tremendous difficulty that people have
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
and I understand why it is so stressful
 
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
is that they know what the person is
 
00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:36.919 align:start position:0%
saying is false but it's difficult to
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
have proof that a jury would find
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
persuasive Beyond A Reasonable Doubt
 
00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:42.200 align:start position:0%
particularly if it is one person's word
 
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
against another that's very difficult
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
thing for 12 unanimous strangers to say
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
who who's telling the truth and who's
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
not um the more you have in terms of
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
contradictory statements in terms of um
 
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
a person may be admitting to you in text
 
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:00.919 align:start position:0%
that they they got you in court today
 
00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
things of that kind are things that the
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
jury can look at and consider um I did
 
00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
um try to talk to a couple prosecutors
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
before coming because I knew this was a
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
subject you'd be looking at and they do
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
take perjury cases from time to time but
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that the impression that
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
I got and it matches with my own
 
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
experience when I used to charge
 
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
material false statement cases as a
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
federal prosecutor um juries have a high
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
standard uh they really don't want
 
00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:29.559 align:start position:0%
someone who's just mistaken who just
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
misspoke uh typically the best evidence
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
that I had the most luck with as a
 
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:35.240 align:start position:0%
prosecutor was a person admitting and
 
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
writing or video that they had lied and
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
and at some point having an
 
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
understanding of why they had lied um
 
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
so it is a it is a challenge uh to meet
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
that Reasonable Doubt standard with a
 
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
jury and I'm sure that's a factor in the
 
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
the cases that County attorneys
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
investigate investigate and prosecute to
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
what degree does provable intentionality
 
00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
play in perjury so it does pen but for
 
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
perjury it does have to be uh it does
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
have to be material uh so it does have
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
to have it potentially impacted the
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
outcome of the
 
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
proceeding um a statement that the
 
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
person does not believe to be true or
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
knew to be false in be required so it's
 
00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
it is certainly not mistake inadvertent
 
00:22:18.679 --> 00:22:19.350 align:start position:0%
it is certainly not mistake inadvertent
uh

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
misr misremembering it has to be some
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
intentionality there that the person
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to mislead the FactFinder a
 
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
couple of people spoke to to me
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
privately and thought that
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
if these individuals said that is a lie
 
00:22:38.669 --> 00:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
and I can prove it it's like the
 
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
proceedings must grind to a halt and
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
that issue must be addressed before it
 
00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.590 align:start position:0%
that issue must be addressed before it
could

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
continue and then put alongside that if
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
the judge uh concludes even if so it
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
does not materially affect the outcome
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
should the judge state that do the
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
judges state
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
that in general the the trial process is
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
intended to create that opportunity to
 
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
offer the relevant evidence and so it
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
might not be offered at that time with
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
that witness you might have a chance to
 
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
offer that relevant evidence later in
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
the trial it may it may not grind the
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
proceedings to a halt it may be that you
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
get that evidence in at a later time but
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
I think it's often the case these are
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
very tough cases these are the worst
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
thing that happens to most people um is
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
being divorced not seeing their children
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
as much as they were going to not living
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
in their family home anymore um that the
 
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
thing that they are very invested in and
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
that they they believe that their maybe
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
their former spouse their co-parent or
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
their child has lied about is not
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
something that would legally affect the
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
outcome of the proceedings and so if
 
00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:47.799 align:start position:0%
that's the case the court may
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
say that that's a collateral issue
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
essentially that if someone has lied
 
00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:53.799 align:start position:0%
they it's still within your purview to
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
bring it to the attention of law
 
00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement it's still something that
 
00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
you can report um but it may not be
 
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
something that would impact the
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
particular legal question which is being
 
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
adjudicated at that moment depending on
 
00:24:06.269 --> 00:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
what that fact
 
00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
is do you think that
 
00:24:09.159 --> 00:24:10.750 align:start position:0%
is do you think that
perhaps

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
um a a greater statement of
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
clarification could be made by the judge
 
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
at such time so the person claiming the
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
other party was
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
perjuring uh would understand how the
 
00:24:27.389 --> 00:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
process is working and not feel like the
 
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
person's just being waved off I know
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's something that that judges take
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
very seriously especially when you're
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with two self-represented
 
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
litigants is wanting to make sure that
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
they understand the process as much as
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
possible um and the exact way it
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
presents in each case is a little
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
different and a little individual each
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
time um what it is that they want to
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
discuss what is being adjudicated at
 
00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
that moment um what evidence they want
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
the court to consider um so I think
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
that's something that judges take very
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
seriously is how in that individual
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
moment do you communicate with this
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
self-represented person and help them to
 
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
understand what's happening in that
 
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:07.480 align:start position:0%
proceeding but I'm I'm not sure even
 
00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:09.559 align:start position:0%
those that do their best and try their
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
hardest bat a thousand and always um get
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
that through in the way that they hope
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
to and want to and I know it's something
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
we're always working on is better
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
communication with self-represented
 
00:25:21.389 --> 00:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
litigant what I've tried to do
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the process of the special
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
court is address
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
the um excited testimony of numbers of
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
people who feel there's something bad
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
going on um
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
to take it what they're saying seriously
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
and if possible
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
give reasons why certain things are
 
00:25:50.669 --> 00:25:50.679 align:start position:0%
being done the way they are um I'm I
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
believe some people when an explanation
 
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
is made would be you know unhappy it
 
00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
went against them but understand it I
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
also know some people will never do that
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
no matter what you say but I want to
 
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
take those who are reasonable and with
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
an explanation say okay I get it uh so
 
00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
what my question is is can we do
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
anything here to
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
improve uh what is being alleged with
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
the statement of perjury for those who
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
could come to understand why and I guess
 
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
so that I can kind of take that question
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
back is it that you're hearing from
 
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.590 align:start position:0%
back is it that you're hearing from
constituents

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
that they're not understanding the role
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
that an accusation of perjury plays in a
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
family case because I can certainly we
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
are constantly training judges on what
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
are the common issues what are things
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
that you can do to communicate better we
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
have a an office that deals with
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
Community engagement where we
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
particularly look at issues with
 
00:26:54.669 --> 00:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigant and how we can
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
handle them better um if there's a
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
common problem we definitely want to to
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
look into that what we can be doing
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
better and training judges on it this
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
could be uh one of the many sub chapters
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
of that wonderful book I know you guys
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
are working on that is given to anybody
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
who comes in uh prosay you know your day
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
in court with all of these questions
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
that arise where there's wonderful
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
explanations on them uh representative
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman
 
00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
parison if I recall um correctly and I I
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
could be wrong um the people from the
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
public who came to testify before us the
 
00:27:41.789 --> 00:27:41.799 align:start position:0%
concern they brought was specific to
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
falsified police reports in which the
 
00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
person then acknowledged that they
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
falsified a police report against the
 
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
other spouse but then no perjury charges
 
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
were filed and I believe we even asked
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
um someone from the court and I can't
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
recall who or from one of the um
 
00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:03.799 align:start position:0%
organizations uh departments how many
 
00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
perjury charges have come out of family
 
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
court and I believe the answer was zero
 
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
in the last 10
 
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
years so I think what the Public's
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
concern is if someone falsifies a police
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
report what is the penalty because
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
according to law it's supposed to be you
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
get charged with perjury but if that's
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
not happening and we continue to have
 
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
people falsifying police reports in
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
order to put themselves in a better
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
position in the Family Court how do we
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
stop that what's if it's we don't want
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
to clog the courts up with a lot of
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
perjury charges but how do we get that
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
recognized within the family court that
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's unacceptable and that there there
 
00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:47.519 align:start position:0%
has to be some accountability obviously
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
the children you can't you can't involve
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
the children in the
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
um that can't affect the um where the
 
00:28:58.990 --> 00:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
children are going to be um located but
 
00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
but there still has to be something how
 
00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
do we stop that I think that's the
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
question I would like to know that's a
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
very good question and uh one one thing
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
I will say is perjury is one of a few
 
00:29:11.509 --> 00:29:11.519 align:start position:0%
different charges in chapter uh 641 and
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
one of them is false report to law
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
enforcement um which is a misdemeanor so
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go before a jury typically I
 
00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
think it's an uncategorized misdemeanor
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
so I think it would go to District uh
 
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
court and one thing I would say is um it
 
00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
should be reported it should be reported
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
to law enforcement if that that has
 
00:29:29.039 --> 00:29:30.549 align:start position:0%
to law enforcement if that that has
happened

00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
um it's difficult for the family court
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
as an adjudicatory body to give their
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
address that people want but if someone
 
00:29:39.549 --> 00:29:39.559 align:start position:0%
has falsified a police report that is a
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
crime um and that is something that the
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
the police have the power to investigate
 
00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:46.039 align:start position:0%
and the County attorneys have the power
 
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
to charge um it's unfortunate to hear
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't happen because it it
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
does seem as though you're he in cases
 
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
where that may have happened and we do
 
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
have a statute that looks to me like a
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
perfectly serviceable criminal statute
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
that covers that conduct um so I'm I'm
 
00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
not sure where the breakdown is but I
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
would encourage litigant to to make that
 
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
report directly because there is a
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
criminal statute that covers that
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
conduct representative
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you it wasn't sure if you see
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
my hand down here I've learned to see
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
Hands represent I did one of her reaches
 
00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
so I think it's also important to for us
 
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
to remember when we think about is this
 
00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:27.519 align:start position:0%
something that's you know um something
 
00:30:30.029 --> 00:30:30.039 align:start position:0%
that we should Pi up even though we have
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
people that say well this was falsified
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
against me or whatever that's that's
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
always very very relative and um truth
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
can be relative which I know people like
 
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
it to be black or white but what one
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
person sees in an instant is going to be
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
very different um I do know that there
 
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
are many people that lack insight into
 
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
their own behaviors and so they might
 
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
think that something has been falsified
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
but when you really dig into it it did
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
happen um that way so I'm not sure that
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
this something that we should really
 
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
look into we do know that there is
 
00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:03.559 align:start position:0%
something for false police reporting
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
we've passed you know bills on um you
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
know blatant I guess uh to make it more
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
criminal if you have a a case of abuse
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
where you've determined abuse or
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
whatever but this is you know this is
 
00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
just one of those very relative things
 
00:31:21.389 --> 00:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
and I sat on that uh special committee
 
00:31:24.509 --> 00:31:24.519 align:start position:0%
on DCF to and where we say we think oh
 
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
well if we make somebody take an oath
 
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:27.320 align:start position:0%
they're definitely going to tell the
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
truth or if we tell people you have to
 
00:31:30.629 --> 00:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
tell the truth again that's not how that
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
works as a matter of fact I think that
 
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
the the study of people will tell you
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
that the more somebody uh says that
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
they're telling the truth it's usually
 
00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
um the negative so this is all very very
 
00:31:43.789 --> 00:31:43.799 align:start position:0%
relative and not something I don't think
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
over uh our history here as you know is
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
we haven't brought forth bills as a sub
 
00:31:57.629 --> 00:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
as a committee but we have had dialogue
 
00:31:57.639 --> 00:31:58.590 align:start position:0%
as a committee but we have had dialogue
in

00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
conversation and I I like how that's
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
been working um representative uh Lynn I
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
my guess is that you know a little bit
 
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.350 align:start position:0%
my guess is that you know a little bit
about

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:32:12.669 --> 00:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
this um I yeah I probably do and I I
 
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
think um I guess I have two comments um
 
00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.269 align:start position:0%
think um I guess I have two comments um
first

00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
um in family law cases there are again
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
my experience goes back aways but I did
 
00:32:27.149 --> 00:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
have fair amount of experience that
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:31.559 align:start position:0%
it's not at all uncommon for one side or
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
the other to be claiming that the other
 
00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:36.039 align:start position:0%
side is lying about
 
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
something actually proving that that's
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
the case is very difficult which why is
 
00:32:41.039 --> 00:32:41.870 align:start position:0%
the case is very difficult which why is
is

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
why um you know there are very very few
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
cases that are actually referred to the
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
to the uh executive branch to for for
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
prosecution and and candidly I I suspect
 
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
I mean you have to talk to somebody from
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
the county attorney's office about this
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
but I suspect that even if cases are
 
00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.629 align:start position:0%
but I suspect that even if cases are
referred

00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
referred
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
um most of the time the County attorneys
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
will regard this as something of
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
relatively low priority in the overall
 
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
scheme of things you know the pro
 
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
prosecutor is going to be told okay
 
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
here's a case where there's an
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
allegation by one party that another
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
party has lied in some Court proceeding
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
um you know how important is this in the
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
overall scheme of things and I suspect
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
that many prosecutors would say you know
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's not all that important particularly
 
00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
if it's not for lack of a better term a
 
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
sort of Slam Dunk if you if you actually
 
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
have a case where somebody has filed a
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
police report and then has admitted that
 
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
the police you know that it was it was
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
false sure that may make that may make
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
uh that may make a prosecutor more
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
inclined to want to move forward with it
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
um my suspicion is that there are not
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
all all that many cases so I I mean I I
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
think that I I guess I don't think that
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
this is Unworthy of looking into but in
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
terms of you know the prospect of of
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
having of of
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh coming up with a sort of better
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
solution I don't know I think I think we
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
would certainly have to have the
 
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial authorities involved in
 
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
this and maybe get getting them more
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
attuned or more willing to
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh to to prosecute those kinds of
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
cases I want to be responsive to the
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
people who have come to testify before
 
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
us when we had open hearings both here
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
and in children and family law that
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
we're taking the concern
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
seriously which may mean we have a
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
one-pager on Des describ
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
in what's next here's if you believe
 
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
that a perjury perjury has been
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
committed in your
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
case here's what you can do next here's
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
the standard you need to come up to
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
here's whom you call but something so
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
that the person believes he or she has
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
been taken seriously even if after that
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go anywhere I want them to
 
00:35:26.589 --> 00:35:26.599 align:start position:0%
understand we are responsive I mean this
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
is the worst time in your life and we we
 
00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
00:35:32.119 --> 00:35:33.870 align:start position:0%
don't want to
be

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
insensitive now it may come to nothing
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
but I I I could just well maybe not but
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
I if if I were in this case I would want
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
to have something in front of me that if
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
I said your honor I think perjury has
 
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
been committed I would have something
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
that tells me here's what I do next
 
00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
here's what I need to have in my hand
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
here's where I need to go here's what
 
00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do about it right
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
here if the judge says even granted it
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
will not materially affect the outcome
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
of this C I need to have all that on one
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
page that would be a help I think to
 
00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
some who
 
00:36:15.309 --> 00:36:15.319 align:start position:0%
feel Justice isn't being
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
served um representative ball thank you
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson and I don't know if
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
this is way off attorney krian you can
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
let me know if this would be way off
 
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
base because we know that it would be
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
very hard to prove that perjury or even
 
00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
um giving a falsified police report
 
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
because when you write the police report
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
you may have believed that that's truly
 
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
what happened and after you think about
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
it it's like well maybe it didn't quite
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
happen that way I was emotional whatever
 
00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:43.829 align:start position:0%
happen that way I was emotional whatever
the

00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:43.839 --> 00:36:45.829 align:start position:0%
the
situation

00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it if it would be
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate and and more than likely it
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be but is there a way of
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
marking the file if so that we don't go
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
forward and the per other person may say
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
well you can't go forward with these
 
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
claims but somehow we could tag the file
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
to say that there was an indiscretion on
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
one part just so that we're aware that
 
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
it and the court or the future judge is
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
aware that something happened in the
 
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
past and we want to make sure that
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
everyone is above board and not
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
misrepresenting uh the truth um in the
 
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:22.839 align:start position:0%
future so I know what some judges do if
 
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
they think it isn't uncommon let's say
 
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
for example for for one parent to say I
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
took care of the child every time the
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
child was sick and the other parent says
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
I took care of the child at least half
 
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
the times they were sick and they both
 
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
think something very close to that is
 
00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
the truth and the truth is maybe a
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
little bit in between um I don't think
 
00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
that would be something that a Jud would
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
stand out to a judge because it's
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
understandable why someone would
 
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
misremember that a little bit um but
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
there are certainly instances where
 
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
someone says something in one hearing
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
and then says something that is clearly
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
different in not
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
reconcilable um in another and I think
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
some judges adopt a practice where they
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
put that in in an order um and they do
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
have that kind of noted particularly if
 
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
they think any records may have been
 
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
messed with um they note that and
 
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes they do if they think there's
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
pretty strong evidence that that
 
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:12.839 align:start position:0%
happened send it over to the county
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
attorney's office so they have the clerk
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
CC County attorney um some of those are
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
compelling to the county attorney
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're not but those are
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
instances where they can then flag on
 
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
the record if you look at exhibit 18
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
exhibit 22 you're going to see something
 
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
that might be of interest to you so you
 
00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
do sometimes see judges do that but it
 
00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
would not typically be for the case
 
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:33.640 align:start position:0%
where one parent remembers a little
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
differently how often they took care of
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
a child was sick because that's that's
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
human nature really that's probably not
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
deception on the part of either person
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
um a situation where records look like
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
they might have been messed with
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
completely contradictory testimony comes
 
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
in I think you do see judges try to put
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
that in orders um and forward it over so
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
that if it's persuasive to a county
 
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
attorney they might do something with it
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
and I did talk to One County attorney
 
00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
from straford who told me he had charge
 
00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
those sometimes he had been able to go
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
back in the records and see that the
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
person had entered two documents that
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
contradicted each other and that was a
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
charge Vice
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you I apologize for not
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
having my notebook with me today can you
 
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
refresh my uh memory as to roughly how
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
many cases a year um a family court
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
ballpark you know I I was ready for a
 
00:39:37.309 --> 00:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
lot of questions I can tell you that
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
title D for 4D came in 1975 and it was
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
implemented in New Hampshire in
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
1985 uh but I have to tell you that
 
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
every time I come rep bford will turn to
 
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
me and say but what about the public
 
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
quarantine laws and I have not prepared
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
for that specific question and then it
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
feels I've really let him down there
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
would be no reason for you to have an
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
um but it is voluminous certainly let me
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
ask another one and if it's the same
 
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
answer I completely understand how many
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh family uh Court judges have um what I
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
as a lay person would call their own
 
00:40:17.309 --> 00:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
clerk to keep track of records and um
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
take care of uh all the work that in
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
almost every Court in the United States
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
the budget writers listen carefully to
 
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
the answer please
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh we have about 44 judges that hear
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
family cases and three staff attorneys
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
that uh that cover any issues related to
 
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
the entire Circuit Court thank you so
 
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
that um if I could then even if the
 
00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:45.319 align:start position:0%
number of cases that a family court
 
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
judge has is theoretically
 
00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.990 align:start position:0%
judge has is theoretically
manageable

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
manageable
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
um what is the
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
likelihood that a family court judge
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
working full-time on Family Court
 
00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
matters is going to know and have the
 
00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
time to uh record in an appropriately
 
00:41:16.589 --> 00:41:16.599 align:start position:0%
Accurate Way um indications of the
 
00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:18.150 align:start position:0%
Accurate Way um indications of the
possibility

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
unproven only alleged that they might
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
have been some
 
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
inaccuracies I I think that's a good
 
00:41:28.349 --> 00:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
question um what what I used to say when
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
I was a a Fed every time the Congress
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
asked for something to be recorded I
 
00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
said every question is $40,000 because
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
we have to hire someone to sift through
 
00:41:38.349 --> 00:41:38.359 align:start position:0%
all the records and and look um for this
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
question to be answered and if it's five
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
questions then we need $200,000 to kind
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
of look through and answer every
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
question because I think sometimes
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's a VI that's very very easy to
 
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
have an extra box but there's a certain
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
amount of time over hundreds or even
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
thousands of cases that's associated
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
with that and then it has to be audited
 
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
to be sure it's correct um so it's it's
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
it's not easy to consistently track
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
things that there's not a business need
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
to track you of course track the
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
location you track the parties but you
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
may not track incidental features of the
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
case um but I do think and I think also
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's very very common for people to
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
disagree about the facts it's but it's
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
not so common that there is good
 
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
evidence um evidence that's noticeable
 
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
to a judge that they say this is
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
something this pleading and this other
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
pleading don't match and that's why in
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
the relatively few cases where it
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
happens a judge will have the thought
 
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
that I'll memorialize that in order but
 
00:42:33.069 --> 00:42:33.079 align:start position:0%
to memorialize every instance in which a
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
person accuses another person of lying
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
and they may simply have different
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
memories would be a very big
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
lift thank you very much um if I could
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
just um without trying just take too
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
much time Mr chair I would like to go
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
back to the draft report that we have
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
prepared so far and suggest to you that
 
00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
the these problems and many others could
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
be solved if number one we took the
 
00:43:05.599 --> 00:43:07.390 align:start position:0%
be solved if number one we took the
committee's

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
committee's
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
suggestion um of more detailed training
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
and education for the judges number two
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
if we could find a way to make
 
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
clear that the
 
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
nominees uh for judges should be people
 
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:30.559 align:start position:0%
who have had professional
 
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
experience in the courts to which
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to be
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
assigned and those and similar uh steps
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:43:44.349 --> 00:43:44.359 align:start position:0%
recommended would address this in a much
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
more meaningful way than us trying to
 
00:43:53.549 --> 00:43:53.559 align:start position:0%
figure out he says she says and I'd just
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
like to have us think about that a
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
little thank you Madam Vice chair all
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
right let's come to a
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
um conclusion on number two potential
 
00:44:08.109 --> 00:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
ways to address
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
perjury remember we want to say to those
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
who have come before us we take your
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
concerns seriously we cannot revisit
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
your trial we are not an appell at court
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
but we can look at process and see if
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
the process might be um changed in any
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
way even if it is to
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
conclude we don't have any
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations at least we've looked at
 
00:44:38.589 --> 00:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
it so uh I've asked representative Lynn
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
if he would be willing to chair this
 
00:44:44.589 --> 00:44:44.599 align:start position:0%
subcommittee if there are sufficient
 
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
workers on it
 
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
um who here would be interested in
 
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
working with representative Lynn on this
 
00:44:54.760 --> 00:45:03.030 align:start position:0%
working with representative Lynn on this
subcommittee

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
all right representative Greg
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative ball representative
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
McMahon okay so I will constitute this
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
as a subcommittee with representative
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
Lynn chairing it we have representative
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
Greg ball and McMahon as members and
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
when I send out a followup on this
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
meeting there may be perhaps one or two
 
00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
more and so we would be good to consider
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
whom should we be speaking with and what
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
do other states do on this subject has
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
this been looked at
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
before and um is this a worthy sub
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
chapter in the book y Dayan court that
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
we're all
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
writing thank you item number three on
 
00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.390 align:start position:0%
writing thank you item number three on
the

00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
list um that we might consider
 
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
researching impl
 
00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
implications of implementing trial by
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
jury and family court which various
 
00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
people testifying have uh
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
requested um I don't Prejudice the
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
outcome as to what this subcommittee
 
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.030 align:start position:0%
outcome as to what this subcommittee
would

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
conclude but uh it may be worth it since
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
people have asked why don't we have this
 
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
if we conclude why indeed let's move
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
towards this or we may conclude in clude
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
because almost nobody else does it
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
because there's 15 reasons why we
 
00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't whatever the outcome is any
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
three I do yes representative long thank
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um so we're looking for
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
a jury that jury would be seated at
 
00:46:52.349 --> 00:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
every hearing it could last for two
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
years 3 years four years how do we
 
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
change the jury
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I I think there's a reason why
 
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.950 align:start position:0%
um I I think there's a reason why
they're

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.630 align:start position:0%
they're
not

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh there's not a jury uh because of that
 
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.270 align:start position:0%
uh there's not a jury uh because of that
impation

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
impation
 
00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.230 align:start position:0%
impation
um

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.349 align:start position:0%
um
okay

00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:17.309 --> 00:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
so anyone
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
else want to way
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
court uh I say I I most know what we do
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and and sometimes less
 
00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
what's What's Done in other states but I
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
did study for this question um and I I
 
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
can tell you it is relatively rare I
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
think a a minority of states have jury
 
00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
trial because of the traditional
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
division between law and equity in the
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
court system and what had a jury and
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
what would go to a court of equity Most
 
00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
states follow the tradition that it it
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
is not a jury trial but there are
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
exceptions um and I think the exceptions
 
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
that you see are typically in single
 
00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
instance highly fact-based
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
determinations so for example some
 
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
states have had jury determinations of
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
paternity that's less exciting now that
 
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
we have DNA testing but that used to be
 
00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
something where credibility and fact
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
finding was potentially a very important
 
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
factor um there so and there for are
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
states that had fault divorce uh where
 
00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
you were determining whether someone had
 
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
committed adultery something like that
 
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
um there there were cred credibility
 
00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:25.720 align:start position:0%
determinations in fact finding that a
 
00:48:28.589 --> 00:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
jury potentially was helpful with now
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
that more states have moved away from
 
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
fault divorce and now the paternity is
 
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
relatively easily established through
 
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
DNA I think you see it's a little less
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
common uh to have juries in a wide range
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
of procedures because of the problem
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
that families come to the courts
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
repeatedly for modifications of certain
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
types of orders you would not be able to
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
constitute that same jury you would have
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
to have a new jury each time um and even
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
in states that do have jury trials for
 
00:48:56.109 --> 00:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
some issues they do not use them for
 
00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
others so so for example when you're
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
looking at this issue you may find that
 
00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
Texas is the absolute High Watermark of
 
00:49:03.309 --> 00:49:03.319 align:start position:0%
number of questions in family law
 
00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
submitted to a jury but there is still a
 
00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:06.799 align:start position:0%
very large number of questions that they
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
do not want the jury weighing in on I
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
think division of property is one I
 
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
think only one state allows custody
 
00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
determinations to be made with jury
 
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
input um so it is it is not extremely
 
00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:19.720 align:start position:0%
common um but there are a couple states
 
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
that do it a few states that do it um
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
but they tend to focus on very factual
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
Vice chairman
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you
 
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
um am I completely
 
00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
naive um I'm sure not I can't even wait
 
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
for the question to end well actually I
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't jump into it if I were you
 
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
because I could be completely naive
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
about this um I don't play lawyer on TV
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
and I never have um but I all I was
 
00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
under the impression that
 
00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.750 align:start position:0%
under the impression that
juries

00:49:58.750 --> 00:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
juries
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
determine facts and
 
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.670 align:start position:0%
determine facts and
judges

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
judges
 
00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.789 align:start position:0%
judges
determine

00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:05.799 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:50:05.799 --> 00:50:11.670 align:start position:0%
determine
law

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
and I see that as an important
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
difference is that is that
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
old-fashioned no ma'am uh that is
 
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
certainly correct that judges typically
 
00:50:23.789 --> 00:50:23.799 align:start position:0%
make legal determinations judges do also
 
00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
make factual determinations in a broad
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
range of circumstances jury in the
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
American system we don't have juries
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
ever making determinations of Law and
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's part of why even in the states
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
that have adopted juries for family
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
cases they still bifurcate the questions
 
00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
of what the jury looks at and the
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
determination of ultimate legal issues
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases um so even if you
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
decided to for example start with one
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
you might still say well the jury will
 
00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
find who was telling the truth but the
 
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
court will make the property
 
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
determination or the court will make the
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
custody determination and I think that's
 
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
what you'd find that other states do as
 
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
well um but that doesn't mean courts and
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
judges can't find facts um you know the
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
typical historical division of the right
 
00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
to jury trial has been where we had them
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
at in the courts of law at the time of
 
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
the founding of the United States which
 
00:51:09.549 --> 00:51:09.559 align:start position:0%
is Criminal trials and certain types of
 
00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
civil trials but not typically family
 
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:26.789 --> 00:51:26.799 align:start position:0%
that do we wish to proceed in making a
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee what's your
 
00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:43.870 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
no I would say no
 
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
I can I
 
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
expand I I
 
00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I I we will impanel them as yeah go
 
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:03.400 align:start position:0%
ahead to me it seems that the jury would
 
00:52:05.549 --> 00:52:05.559 align:start position:0%
be more in a criminal court and unless
 
00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
this was in a criminal situation um I
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
don't see a jury in Family
 
00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.510 align:start position:0%
don't see a jury in Family
Court

00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
Okay no Okay so we're not going to go
 
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
this maybe some other group at some
 
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:20.870 align:start position:0%
this maybe some other group at some
other

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
time um since we do have four proposals
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
that we started with and we have nine
 
00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:29.870 align:start position:0%
that we started with and we have nine
members

00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
um it would not be bad to limit the
 
00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:35.799 align:start position:0%
number of projects subcommittees and so
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
on number four uh representative Greg
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
would you make your presentation please
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
this is four on the bottom of the hand
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
sure I'd be happy to and thank you Mr
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
chairman and I've talked to um attorney
 
00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
krian about this particular case so I
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
had a constituent called that has had
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
guardianship for of her granddaughter
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
for um many years
 
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.510 align:start position:0%
for um many years
um

00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
and I suppose what they're supposed to
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
do according to the paper that I have is
 
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
have an email that's registered and I
 
00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:07.640 align:start position:0%
did talk to um representative McBeth
 
00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday at Great length about the
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
process of this because she's familiar
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
with these cases that in particular type
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
in guardianship cases they have gone to
 
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
electronic and not um paper so that
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
explained that a little bit further but
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
the um Guardian filed her uh filed her
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
paper in September and thought that she
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
probably didn't have to do anything for
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
another year the mother uh within 2
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
months later um filed to have the
 
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
guardianship um terminated had a hearing
 
00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
the grandmother had not checked her
 
00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
email so did not know any of this was
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
happening and found out that she had
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
lost the case by virtue of her not
 
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
protesting by the police knocking on the
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
door and saying they were taking the
 
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
little girl
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
immediately um which is pretty extreme
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
so I guess what I'm interested in and
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
I'm want to make sure that I'm focusing
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
on the right thing I do see the personal
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility element of knowing that
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
we need to check email if you've been
 
00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
told that and actually I have the um
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
motion to terminate guardianship that
 
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
I've redacted uh with any pertinent
 
00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
things but it does say on there that
 
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
they had to the email address that all
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
interested parties are required to keep
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
and monitor um but also what happen you
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
know what that does to that little girl
 
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
when they just show up if there has not
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
if this has been a guardian that has
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
been commuted to communicative is all of
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
a sudden not communicative um and then
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
we're just going to take custody of a
 
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
little girl who's been in there for I
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
think over seven years with her
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
grandmother and going to stay with her
 
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
mother who she's not seen now for most
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
of the year what does that process look
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
like and is there anything that were
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
kind of missing in there that um that we
 
00:54:47.309 --> 00:54:47.319 align:start position:0%
would you know are the judges doing
 
00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
anything like oh we haven't heard from
 
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
this person do we give them a heads up
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
and maybe I think that um repres that uh
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
attorney KGAN has looked into it so
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:02.109 --> 00:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
put hello uh thank you for bringing that
 
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
case to our attention um because these
 
00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:06.200 align:start position:0%
are confidential cases I'm just going to
 
00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
speak hypothetically the constituent is
 
00:55:09.309 --> 00:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
totally free to discuss it with her
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative but I as a court system
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
person have to be a little bit careful
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
but um we we did do a review and I think
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
there is room for improvement here um I
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
can say that very few circuit court case
 
00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
types have been transitioned over to
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
electronic and guardianship is one of
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
those case types and mostly people
 
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
people prefer to use their email rather
 
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
than mail but that's not without some
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
unanticipated consequences and there can
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
certainly be a case where a person gets
 
00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
Court email and for some reason it goes
 
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
to their junk folder um and they don't
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
see it um there was there is a process
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
generally in place for guardianship
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
cases where if the email bounces back a
 
00:55:51.549 --> 00:55:51.559 align:start position:0%
letter is sent I think our view is that
 
00:55:52.829 --> 00:55:52.839 align:start position:0%
in light of learning this we need to
 
00:55:55.029 --> 00:55:55.039 align:start position:0%
also send a mail letter when the email
 
00:55:57.309 --> 00:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
is not read um which we do have the
 
00:56:00.029 --> 00:56:00.039 align:start position:0%
ability to go in and check uh but that
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
would only respond to this one
 
00:56:03.309 --> 00:56:03.319 align:start position:0%
particular case and I think we can make
 
00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:04.839 align:start position:0%
that change in our procedures and we and
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
we see that there's room to do this
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
better I also referred this question
 
00:56:10.589 --> 00:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
over to our community engagement and
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
access committee because I think there's
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
a broader question about expanding
 
00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:17.799 align:start position:0%
electronic case types in Circuit Court
 
00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
where people are very used to them being
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
male and whether there are any
 
00:56:23.549 --> 00:56:23.559 align:start position:0%
unanticipated consequences and I don't
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
think we this is one example of one
 
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
consequence but I want to I think we
 
00:56:29.309 --> 00:56:29.319 align:start position:0%
want to look into whether they're
 
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
potentially others um
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
because attorneys if an attorney is
 
00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:38.039 align:start position:0%
using their Law Firm email they are
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
checking that email always they do not
 
00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
have messages from the court going to
 
00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:43.480 align:start position:0%
their spam folder um but that could
 
00:56:46.349 --> 00:56:46.359 align:start position:0%
happen with a private citizen so I we I
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
think there's there's learning as we
 
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
expand in case types where most people
 
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
are self are presented um to email
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
notification and that's that's something
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're reviewing but I think this
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh does show us that there was a
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
procedure change that we needed to make
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
that if an email was not opened we also
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
needed to send a physical letter um but
 
00:57:05.309 --> 00:57:05.319 align:start position:0%
there may be others and if you hear
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
anything from your constituents from
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
anyone anyone who's on YouTube um you
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
know send a letter to the AOC or email
 
00:57:15.789 --> 00:57:15.799 align:start position:0%
is online or send it to me because uh we
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
we do want to know uh we do want to fix
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
procedures that are not working for
 
00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
people would you find it helpful if a
 
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh were to meet with you
 
00:57:28.109 --> 00:57:28.119 align:start position:0%
and perhaps a few others from
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
Judiciary uh to examine this issue I I
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
defer to you but I would encourage
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
anyone whether they're a member of this
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
sub committee or not to reach out
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
because we want to know when things are
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
not working for the people the course
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
that is the gracious way in which you
 
00:57:44.349 --> 00:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
have interacted with us thus far I just
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:48.839 align:start position:0%
check anyone representative Lynn so can
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
I just raise a question is um am I
 
00:57:53.549 --> 00:57:53.559 align:start position:0%
correct in understanding that if if
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
someone is starting a lawsuit in other
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
words the very
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
first F the very first filing that that
 
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
the notice of that to the
 
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
defendant does not come does not go
 
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
through email it would go there would
 
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
have to be serviced by the sheriff or
 
00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
whatever is that correct it depends on
 
00:58:15.029 --> 00:58:15.039 align:start position:0%
the case type what types of services are
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
accepted but it it can be male service
 
00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
it can be serviced by the sheriff um so
 
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
it it's particular something other than
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
email though is that correct so I guess
 
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
the thing I'm a little curious about is
 
00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:29.039 align:start position:0%
it um it seems
 
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559 align:start position:0%
like although the mother filed this
 
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
motion to terminate the guard it it was
 
00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:37.160 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that is almost
 
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
like you know a new proceeding that
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
should have resulted in kind of more
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
formal notice um uh may maybe not by the
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
sheriff but at least you know a
 
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:52.039 align:start position:0%
certified letter or something like that
 
00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
that would really kind of get the
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
attention of the person that's a great
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
question there are some statutory
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
requirements when you sort of reopen or
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
refresh a case that there is a reservice
 
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
there was not that requirement for this
 
00:59:07.069 --> 00:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
case type um so so that does happen in
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
some family cases but but not for this
 
00:59:10.589 --> 00:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
one we could make changes to our rules
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily have to be a
 
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
statutory change but I think that's what
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
you're thinking of is that family cases
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
that have been dormant for a long time
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
they often are reopened by a reservice
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
right that's required and that was not a
 
00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
requirement for this case type okay all
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
right anyone else
 
00:59:29.789 --> 00:59:29.799 align:start position:0%
yes Madam Vice
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
chair could you help me understand why
 
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
it would be police officers going to a
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
house to take a child who obviously had
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
not committed any act that was contrary
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
to the law rather than uh trained social
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%
workers and I'm using that as a general
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
term that I do not have information
 
00:59:56.109 --> 00:59:56.119 align:start position:0%
about representative I apologize I don't
 
00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:57.640 align:start position:0%
know why it would be a police officer
 
00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:58.549 align:start position:0%
know why it would be a police officer
being

00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
involved thank
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
you representative ball thank you
 
01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.349 align:start position:0%
you representative ball thank you
chairman

01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
Parson I guess I'm still old school
 
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
so sorry that's old school that's old
 
01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
school new
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
school um so it seems sending a police
 
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
well not to get the child but the
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
paperwork um in servicing and all why
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
are we not using just certified maale to
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
assure and especially in a case that
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
involves child custody is becoming in
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
question it just seems to me the easiest
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
thing to do is require certified
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
male you know where the address is and
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
if that certified mail comes back to you
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
that's a red flag that we better get
 
01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
there right away because this person has
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
a child um you know that they are
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
responsible for and they obviously may
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
not be at that address anymore so I'm
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
just wondering why did we stray away
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
from old school and go to something
 
01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
where we still have people
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
um in our society that are not using
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
email um in the way that um some other
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
people are using it that might be more
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
professional people but those of us in
 
01:01:11.029 --> 01:01:11.039 align:start position:0%
the older Generation Um may not
 
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
recognize that thanks that's a great
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
question one of the most consistent
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
pieces of feedback we receive from the
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
public is the desire to transition cases
 
01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
over to have more email uh use um and we
 
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
do get complaints the other way people
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
are really struggle to update the court
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
when they change their mailing address
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
um it's a very consistent issue that
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
people just do not remember you think of
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
all the things you have to change when
 
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
you change your address you inevitably
 
01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:37.240 align:start position:0%
Miss some every time I move I miss some
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
people miss the court um so people Miss
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
very important filings by mail all the
 
01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
time and so some folks have indicated to
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
us that they use the same email their
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
whole life that would be easier for them
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
um so we we do get different feedback
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
from different people
 
01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
followup could we not use both systems
 
01:01:59.069 --> 01:01:59.079 align:start position:0%
continue with the certified mail which
 
01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:01.720 align:start position:0%
is what5 or $7 or whatever it is and
 
01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
still send a notice as well just to make
 
01:02:06.829 --> 01:02:06.839 align:start position:0%
sure that we're covering both bases
 
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
especially since a child um is involved
 
01:02:09.319 --> 01:02:10.230 align:start position:0%
especially since a child um is involved
in

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
this I think for it's a determination
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
that there there are statutory
 
01:02:16.349 --> 01:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
components so certainly the legislature
 
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
can adjust some of them but for some
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
regular notifications you may not find
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
that that's necessary um but because in
 
01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:26.119 align:start position:0%
the same way that there's reservice in
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
certain family cases this may be
 
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
something where you determine that
 
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
reservice is appropriate for certain
 
01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
kinds of motions in a guardianship case
 
01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
rules yes
 
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
welcome um thank you for um taking the
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
question didn't you say I think you said
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
something that the Court can check and
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
see whether an email has been opened so
 
01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
um is that is that correct and is that's
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
a procedure that you all could change
 
01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.150 align:start position:0%
a procedure that you all could change
Within

01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
Within
 
01:02:58.589 --> 01:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
um without speaking on a particular case
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
I can say when I generally looked into
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
this issue I found that we did have the
 
01:03:03.069 --> 01:03:03.079 align:start position:0%
ability to see that when someone had not
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
opened their email I don't know if it's
 
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
foolproof or maybe there's certain types
 
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
of emails where it's easier than others
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
but we generally do and so our thought
 
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:13.240 align:start position:0%
of the easiest change to make was to
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
mail if we had an unread um email on an
 
01:03:16.799 --> 01:03:18.430 align:start position:0%
mail if we had an unread um email on an
important

01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
followup I I so I've actually would you
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
believe had um a clerk's office call
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
seeing that I had not opened something
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
that had gone to my spam or that I had
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
missed and realizing that either I
 
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
hadn't submitted a report or that it
 
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't open and something was coming up
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
so but again that that can't be
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
something that we always require but I
 
01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
think it probably is happening in some
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
cases and I mean this is that's a really
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
sorry Case um I also will say that some
 
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys I do my mail goes to spam if I
 
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
file in a court that I haven't filed in
 
01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
recently like a superior court or
 
01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
something like that so I think the spam
 
01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
idea I mean that that's it is if you all
 
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
can check if that is when people don't
 
01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
open their mail it's it's probably not
 
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
just the public although I know I know
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
because it's happened I mean that's why
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm familiar with it so I know to
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
check spam as what that's good to know
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
because we we often don't hear um so
 
01:04:16.589 --> 01:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
that I appreciate that feedback that's
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
good to know that that's a broader
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
problem representative ball thank you
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
chairman Parson um it's my understanding
 
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
that email can also be sent with with a
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
receipt uh requested so it could be as
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
easy as just starting to send things out
 
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
receipt requested that way you would
 
01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
have a um a paper trail thank
 
01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:41.720 align:start position:0%
you the question since I am struggling
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
to learn email and didn't know about
 
01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
this until just now is there a receipt
 
01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
sent when they open the email or when it
 
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
lands in their
 
01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
inbox chairman parison I believe it's
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
when they open it it confirms that they
 
01:04:58.349 --> 01:04:58.359 align:start position:0%
have received it and they have they've
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
opened it is that
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
this that's good thank you you got to
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
learn how to do
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
that anyone
 
01:05:12.029 --> 01:05:12.039 align:start position:0%
else okay good thank you um who' like to
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
be on this subcommittee representative
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
Greg I have asked that if we get a few
 
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
people to work with her this can be a
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and she can share it who
 
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
else what I already signed up for a
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
couple of committees but I do think this
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
is a very important committee and if you
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
need another person um I would be happy
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
to help but I do think that you are in
 
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
good hands um working within the
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
Departments no one is accusing you of
 
01:05:59.789 --> 01:05:59.799 align:start position:0%
being greedy I know just to let you know
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
I do think that's extremely
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
important yeah this this email will go
 
01:06:09.069 --> 01:06:09.079 align:start position:0%
out to representative katab uh to see
 
01:06:11.789 --> 01:06:11.799 align:start position:0%
where she would like to slot in
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
um and we'll give a last few minutes I
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
know a couple people uh thank you for
 
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
coming uh got here late but thank you
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
for coming take a look at the handout
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
sheet and see item number one to review
 
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
it's research title four we questioned
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
how does this have to do with family
 
01:06:32.829 --> 01:06:32.839 align:start position:0%
court subsection D child support aspect
 
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
of it is in the courts so uh number one
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
is something we could
 
01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.630 align:start position:0%
is something we could
do

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
um item number two has to do with the
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
ways to address perjury we looked at
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
some possibilities but at least to come
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
up with an explanations of why the court
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
does what it does so people who are
 
01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
wondering would
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
have an answer I think everyone was here
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
for three we said no to that we would
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
just here for four if there's anybody
 
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:06.920 align:start position:0%

uh item number four yeah uh if you could
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
also look at I I've gotten calls from
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
foster parents who've had a child taken
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
where they didn't realize that child was
 
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
going to be taken um so just on
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh look at the overall disposition of
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
children that are moving from Foster
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
Care to foster care or uh or like the
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
case uh the Guardian case also just
 
01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.550 align:start position:0%
case uh the Guardian case also just
any

01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
any issues that we've heard on children
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
being removed where the adults that were
 
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
responsible weren't made aware of that
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
is that through the court C or through
 
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
the through HH yes uh I believe it in in
 
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
a couple cases that I heard uh the
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
foster parents it's been through that
 
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
HHS has has uh gone over not necessarily
 
01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
a police officer so although you are not
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%

01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:44.120 align:start position:0%

01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility for item four okay so um
 
01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
I will put this in lowercase letter
 
01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
