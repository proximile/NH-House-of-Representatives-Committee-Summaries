00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
um let's see we should have 10 and we
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
have 2 4 6 8 we are missing Joe and we
 
00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
are missing who else
 
00:17:53.409 --> 00:17:53.419 align:start position:0%
missing at Caitlin but she's not here
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
so she she is she's Disneyland she might
 
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
well I do think of Shakespeare exactly
 
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
do you know that today is the perfect
 
00:18:25.679 --> 00:19:03.730 align:start position:0%
do you know that today is the perfect
date

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:03.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
I call to order this
 
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
special committee on the Family Division
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
and I've got an opening statement which
 
00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:18.059 align:start position:0%
I hope will set the tone I've had much
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
of this with different individuals but
 
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
now this is for the record
 
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
the immediate cause of this special
 
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
committee is the experience at the
 
00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:31.460 align:start position:0%
beginning of the 2023
 
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
2024 term of the house children and
 
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
family law committee
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
several bills with which we were
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
presented addressed perceived errors on
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
the part of the family division of
 
00:19:45.529 --> 00:19:45.539 align:start position:0%
circuit court in the state of New
 
00:19:45.539 --> 00:19:46.690 align:start position:0%
circuit court in the state of New
Hampshire

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:46.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
subsequent testimony by Bill sponsors
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
and by the general public alleged among
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
other things fail you failure to follow
 
00:19:58.810 --> 00:19:58.820 align:start position:0%
or enforce statutes
 
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
unwarranted waiver of or failure to
 
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
follow court rules
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
delay in rendering decisions denial of
 
00:20:12.289 --> 00:20:12.299 align:start position:0%
due process and other procedural issues
 
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
this is consistent with comments I've
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
testimony from representatives of the
 
00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:25.700 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
deny these things were taking place
 
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
so whom do we believe
 
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
how can we put a lot of these
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
allegations to rest what do we do going
 
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.710 align:start position:0%
allegations to rest what do we do going
forward

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
as chairman of that children and family
 
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039 align:start position:0%
law committee I arranged for a meeting
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
with the honorable Gordon McDonald Chief
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
Justice of the Supreme Court The
 
00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:51.059 align:start position:0%
Honorable David King administrative
 
00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
judge of the circuit court and others
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
we arranged for the first of what we
 
00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
hope will be a series of continuing
 
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
education days for both the house
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee and
 
00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:06.539 align:start position:0%
the house Judiciary Committee
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
however we came to believe more was
 
00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.430 align:start position:0%
however we came to believe more was
needed

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
hence the constituting of this special
 
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:16.700 align:start position:0%
committee it consists of 10 members
 
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
chosen equally among the two political
 
00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:22.919 align:start position:0%
parties represented in the house and
 
00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
equally among the children and family
 
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
law Committee in the Judiciary Committee
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
it was my privilege to do the voir deer
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
those considered for membership were
 
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
individuals who were deemed to be
 
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.149 align:start position:0%
individuals who were deemed to be
impartial

00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
impartial
 
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
that is they were known they were not
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
known to be of strong opinions about
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
Family Court one way or the other
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
they had not recently
 
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
served as lawyers representing anyone in
 
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
cases before Family Court
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
they had not recently been a judge
 
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
we wanted people who could be neutral in
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
hearing what was presented to us
 
00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
testimony will be collated by the two
 
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
committee secretaries appointed one of
 
00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:12.539 align:start position:0%
whom is away this week
 
00:22:15.529 --> 00:22:15.539 align:start position:0%
and the Coalition will be primarily on
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
the basis of topics that's a little
 
00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
different from the minutes of most
 
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
committee hearings we will want the
 
00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
filing of information to be by the
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
topics comprising the various complaints
 
00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
against family court for example if we
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
in the next several weeks get 12
 
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.049 align:start position:0%
in the next several weeks get 12
specific

00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:36.059 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:22:36.059 --> 00:22:36.770 align:start position:0%
specific
um

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
bits of testimony about violation of the
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence all of those will go
 
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
in that Rules of Evidence complaint file
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
testimony from the various stakeholder
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
groups and from individuals
 
00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
from the public will be collated
 
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
for that reason in order for one's
 
00:22:59.690 --> 00:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
testimony to be helpful
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
as the special committee eventually
 
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
draws conclusions on the way to making
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the Judiciary and as
 
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
we consider possible new laws testimony
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
must be specific
 
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
specific first in terms of signing the
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
pink card so you may testify you have
 
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
every right to give just your name
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
however if when we consider your
 
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
testimony we have some questions for you
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
some follow-ups when a couple of weeks a
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
couple of months from now we look at
 
00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:42.059 align:start position:0%
your testimony and we want some
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
clarification you will do your case well
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
if you put on the pink card your contact
 
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
information phone and email once again
 
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
you do not have to do it but if you've
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
come to testify because you want to
 
00:23:58.490 --> 00:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
convince us of something that will help
 
00:24:00.409 --> 00:24:00.419 align:start position:0%
as we follow up
 
00:24:00.419 --> 00:24:01.730 align:start position:0%
as we follow up
second

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of specifics is the testimony
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
that we will allow
 
00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:12.740 align:start position:0%
generalized statements are not helpful
 
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
oh everybody knows the courts are bias
 
00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.470 align:start position:0%
oh everybody knows the courts are bias
against

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
dads in a custody hearing
 
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
I don't know that and that's not helpful
 
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
that's a broad assertion it is not fact
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
to say the judge didn't follow the rules
 
00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
of evidence proves nothing
 
00:24:35.159 --> 00:24:36.590 align:start position:0%
of evidence proves nothing
however

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
if in your testimony
 
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
you tell us specifics on what day was
 
00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:48.539 align:start position:0%
the trial held at what time before what
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
judge in what courtroom and at what
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
point was evidence proffered that was
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
refused now we have something to go on
 
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
we may go back and try to look at the
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
trial record to get a context
 
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
anything short of specifics like that
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
will not help your case and will waste
 
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
everyone's time
 
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
so prove your case
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
and if others do the same on a
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
particular issue or another issue we may
 
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
have something to go on in terms of
 
00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.870 align:start position:0%
have something to go on in terms of
reform

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
reform
 
00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.190 align:start position:0%
reform
next

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
please understand those of you who would
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
come to testify we will not retry your
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
case so do not come and give us a story
 
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
about how your case was mangled in the
 
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.909 align:start position:0%
about how your case was mangled in the
court

00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
now in colonial days the legislature
 
00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
often received petitions for the redress
 
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
of grievances
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
according to former house legal counsel
 
00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Charles G Douglas III this
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
was because and I quote a memo to me
 
00:26:06.409 --> 00:26:06.419 align:start position:0%
there were few standing committees in
 
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
the legislature there were few
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic agencies in the executive
 
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
branch to deal directly with the
 
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
Grievances of individuals or groups of
 
00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.890 align:start position:0%
Grievances of individuals or groups of
citizens

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:21.419 align:start position:0%
so much of the legislation that was
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
introduced was enacted in response to
 
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
petitions in other words the the court
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature was pretty much the
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
court the executive department it was
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
almost all three branches of government
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
minus a royal king
 
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.950 align:start position:0%
minus a royal king
that

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
retrying of cases however
 
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.269 align:start position:0%
retrying of cases however
stopped

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
stopped
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
in the September term of 1818
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court of New Hampshire in
 
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
the case of Meryl V Sherborne wrote this
 
00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
an act of the legislature awarding a new
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
trial and an action which has been
 
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
decided in a court of law as an exercise
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
of judicial power
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
it is also in its operation
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
retrospective for these two reasons
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
it is unconstitutional
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
at the end of the opinion merovi
 
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
Sherborne and I believe members of this
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
committee have been provided with a copy
 
00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:19.940 align:start position:0%
and of
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
councilor Douglas's statement the
 
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
legislature cannot pass an act and our
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
judgment therefore is that the
 
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
proceedings of this case which was the
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
request to retry a case is quashed
 
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
so therefore any testimony that appears
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
to ask the special committee to
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
challenge a Court verdict
 
00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
will be interrupted and not allowed to
 
00:27:45.659 --> 00:27:47.149 align:start position:0%
will be interrupted and not allowed to
continue

00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of witnesses stakeholder groups
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
because they represent many individuals
 
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
will be given some considerable time in
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
making their presentation but they too
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
may not make broad generalizations but
 
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
rather must cite specific instances with
 
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
dates approximate time in the hearing
 
00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
the name of the judge presiding and the
 
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
perceived error that was made again
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
prove your case members of the public
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
will be given five minutes and this will
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
be timed
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
house rule 100 allows this to happen
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
we hope that there will be a four minute
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
30 second polite warning no noise
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
to let you know you got 30 seconds to
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
wrap up with a less polite noise at five
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
minutes when you're done
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
you'll be allowed to finish your
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
statement and then your microphone will
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
be turned off now we do this for a
 
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons number one
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
they're probably as we get going will be
 
00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:51.980 align:start position:0%
numbers of people who wish to testify
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
and if we just let individuals testify
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
until they run out of air
 
00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:00.860 align:start position:0%
um we may be going on forever
 
00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
secondly to make an allegation of a
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
perceived error doesn't take that long
 
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
it does not take that long to tell us
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
the date the place the time where in the
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
trial who is the judge and the
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
perception of error or if there was no
 
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.370 align:start position:0%
perception of error or if there was no
error

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
error
 
00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:24.419 align:start position:0%
that the rule that was followed should
 
00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
be changed that won't take long so this
 
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
will help people be on point
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
those of you who wish to testify please
 
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
fill out a pink card
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
hand it to the nearest member of the
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee don't walk it up to me but
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
hand it to the nearest member of the
 
00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
committee who will then pass it along
 
00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.730 align:start position:0%
committee who will then pass it along
now

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:48.740 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
if you filled out a pink card and it's
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
come in
 
00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
and you've heard the testimonies and
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
realize what you've written out won't be
 
00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:00.049 align:start position:0%
realize what you've written out won't be
accepted

00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:00.059 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
you can have another bite of the Apple
 
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
if I call your name just say Mr chairman
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
I would like to revise my testimony may
 
00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059 align:start position:0%
I testify it another time the answer is
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
yes you may because we want your input
 
00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
to be as helpful to your case as it can
 
00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.570 align:start position:0%
to be as helpful to your case as it can
be

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
if you have written testimony to hand in
 
00:30:24.169 --> 00:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
please make sure it is that kind of
 
00:30:27.889 --> 00:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
testimony we I for one will not read
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
through volumes of stuff that talk about
 
00:30:33.529 --> 00:30:33.539 align:start position:0%
this one is corrupt and that judge's
 
00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
cousin is such I I don't read those
 
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.549 align:start position:0%
cousin is such I I don't read those
things

00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:40.860 align:start position:0%
um so don't don't waste my paper please
 
00:30:45.049 --> 00:30:45.059 align:start position:0%
or yours boil it down to what we need to
 
00:30:45.059 --> 00:30:46.070 align:start position:0%
or yours boil it down to what we need to
hear

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
hear
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
there are 10 of us and there's a Clerk's
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
filed so if you wish to turn in things
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
11 copies would be helpful
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
and because we have much to do we will
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
adjourn at 12 noon
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
if somebody is testifying at 12 noon
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
that person will be allowed to continue
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
but will be the last person to testify
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
for that day believe me some of us
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
around the table have been here to nine
 
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
o'clock at night because there was only
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
one day set aside for a Committee
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
hearing any pink cards that are left
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
over at noon that have not been utilized
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
I haven't called on you will go to the
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
head of the list for subsequent weeks
 
00:31:30.409 --> 00:31:30.419 align:start position:0%
um we are presently scheduled for May
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
2nd 9 16 and 23 at 9 30 in the morning
 
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
we will take off May 30th which is the
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
day after Memorial Day
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
I have asked the committee to reserve in
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
their calendar the first three Tuesdays
 
00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
of June we may or may not need them
 
00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
we'll find out
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
so if you did not get called upon to
 
00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
testify and the new now it comes
 
00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
I will start with you and others from
 
00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:03.299 align:start position:0%
that leftover batch the next week unless
 
00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
you can't be here and then give me a
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
date and I'll put your name and date in
 
00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.630 align:start position:0%
date and I'll put your name and date in
that

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
before we break for the summer the
 
00:32:12.649 --> 00:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
committee may decide to make some
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
preliminary suggestions to the Judiciary
 
00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
this will be discussed and we may make
 
00:32:21.409 --> 00:32:21.419 align:start position:0%
those suggestions we may not
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
we will call upon the Judiciary later on
 
00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
this spring to make comments for example
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
let's suppose we are going to be opening
 
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
up that file on Rules of Evidence
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
we would like the Judiciary then to come
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
and give us specifically printed copy
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
and testimony what those Rules of
 
00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:48.059 align:start position:0%
Evidence are
 
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
I have discovered that there are numbers
 
00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:54.299 align:start position:0%
of people who know about Rules of
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
Evidence because they've watched 22
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
years of Law and Order on TV to which I
 
00:33:02.409 --> 00:33:02.419 align:start position:0%
will say despite my great respect for
 
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
councilor Jack McCoy those are criminal
 
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
cases we're talking about civil the
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
rules are different so we will hear from
 
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary not so much as a rebuttal
 
00:33:15.889 --> 00:33:15.899 align:start position:0%
at this point but to outline the
 
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
specifics of those issues that seem to
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
be presented to us
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
I believe when our work is finished a
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
few of us will draft a final report
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
which will be reviewed by the entire
 
00:33:30.769 --> 00:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
special committee for revision and we
 
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
hope eventually final approval
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
individual members may decide to craft
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
some draft legislation for the next year
 
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
I conclude with reading the notice and
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
disclaimer this was printed
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
on the back page of the last
 
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
House calendar
 
00:33:57.409 --> 00:33:57.419 align:start position:0%
and I have been asked to read this
 
00:34:00.529 --> 00:34:00.539 align:start position:0%
statement at this and every committee
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
meeting because it I we want to make
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
very sure that if you're coming here
 
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
you will speak in ways that we will hear
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
so here goes
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
the special committee on the Family
 
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
Division of the Circuit Court was formed
 
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
to investigate allegations of
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
irregularities including failure to
 
00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:26.060 align:start position:0%
follow or enforce statutes
 
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
unwarranted waiver of or failure to
 
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
follow court rules delay in rendering
 
00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
decisions denial of due process and
 
00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:39.419 align:start position:0%
other procedural issues
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
the committee will conduct hearings
 
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
relative to the process of the Family
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
Division of the circuit court and may
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
make recommendations for future
 
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.669 align:start position:0%
make recommendations for future
legislation

00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the committee is to
 
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
discover areas where changes in
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
procedures or changes in law regarding
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
the Family Division of the Circuit Court
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
may be made
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this special committee is
 
00:35:08.329 --> 00:35:08.339 align:start position:0%
not to retry the cases of citizens who
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
disagree with the outcome of litigation
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
members of the public will be given an
 
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify and present
 
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
information to the committee
 
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
because of the number of people who may
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
wish to testify there may be a time
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
limit imposed on each person testifying
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
which is permissible under house rule
 
00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
100. appropriate subject matter for
 
00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:36.380 align:start position:0%
testifying will be limited to specific
 
00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:39.740 align:start position:0%
instances of where there seemed to be
 
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
irregularities in process procedure or
 
00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
adherence to rules and statutes those
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
testifying about subject matter related
 
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
to a court case or who submit
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
documentation relating to a court case
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
should know that both will be made part
 
00:35:59.930 --> 00:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
of the public record
 
00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
therefore subject matter that is either
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
confidential or may be under seal should
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
not be discussed or submitted to the
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee as disclosure of such matters
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
would be a violation of Statute or a
 
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
court order and let me parenthetically
 
00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:20.700 align:start position:0%
add this will be the burden of this will
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
be on those who testify it may not be
 
00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
immediately apparent to any of us in the
 
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
committee or to me as the chairman
 
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh something that is said shouldn't have
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
been said I may not know that so you're
 
00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
going to have to be very careful about
 
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.890 align:start position:0%
going to have to be very careful about
this

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
finally the committee reserves the right
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
to not accept written or oral testimony
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
or materials which would in its judgment
 
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
violate the foregoing
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
so with that is the long introductory
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
statement anybody wished to respond from
 
00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
the committee and I call upon my vice
 
00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:59.150 align:start position:0%
the committee and I call upon my vice
chair

00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I was honored when
 
00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:08.099 align:start position:0%
um the speaker asked if I would agree to
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
serve as the vice chair of this
 
00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:14.339 align:start position:0%
committee I am honored because the
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
speaker asked me I am honored to be able
 
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
to serve with the distinguished chair of
 
00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:21.980 align:start position:0%
Children and Family
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
I have uh
 
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
my normal home is with the Judiciary
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
Committee and I have had a long
 
00:37:35.089 --> 00:37:35.099 align:start position:0%
experience with the Judiciary Committee
 
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm ranking member uh
 
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.329 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm ranking member uh
foreign

00:37:41.329 --> 00:37:41.339 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
I follow closely the decisions that are
 
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
made by my fellow legislators who serve
 
00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:52.700 align:start position:0%
on other committees when those decisions
 
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:54.839 align:start position:0%
seem to
 
00:37:58.370 --> 00:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
um involve the workings of the judicial
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
branch since in fact it's the Judiciary
 
00:38:04.609 --> 00:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
Committee charged with oversight of the
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
it was of great concern to me
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
when I discovered
 
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
now I guess it's at least a month ago
 
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
perhaps more that a Bill had passed
 
00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
children and family law
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly supported by the members
 
00:38:33.069 --> 00:38:33.079 align:start position:0%
of children and family law that
 
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
expressed concern about the operation of
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
the Family Division of the circuit court
 
00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:44.060 align:start position:0%
and express that concern so strongly
 
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
that among other things they ask that
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
the committee children and family law be
 
00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
given subpoena power to subpoena the
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
judges of this state
 
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
I must say that that shocked me
 
00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
and it was that shock that caused me to
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
go to speak with
 
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.130 align:start position:0%
go to speak with
um

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh with speaker Packard
 
00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.150 align:start position:0%
uh with speaker Packard
um

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
about my concern and I believe that I
 
00:39:23.089 --> 00:39:23.099 align:start position:0%
was not alone and I know that the chair
 
00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:24.980 align:start position:0%
sitting on my left
 
00:39:29.569 --> 00:39:29.579 align:start position:0%
was immediately involved and receptive
 
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
to concern expressed about that bill and
 
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
for that I I thank him
 
00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:37.990 align:start position:0%
for that I I thank him
um

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
I have uh listened for the first time to
 
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
what the chair has just said and was
 
00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
interested in much of what he said
 
00:39:54.609 --> 00:39:54.619 align:start position:0%
and concerned because it did sound to me
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
as if it were
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
trial rather than a legislative hearing
 
00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
in which the legislative Hearing in
 
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:09.260 align:start position:0%
which we would be collecting information
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
as much as we could from disparate
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
sources to make sure that we in the
 
00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
legislature do our part
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
um in in how the three branches of
 
00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
government work but recognizing that
 
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:29.300 align:start position:0%
there are three branches and for example
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
recognizing that it is not the
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
legislature but the Judiciary that makes
 
00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
the rules for the operation of the
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
judicial branch if we were to
 
00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.650 align:start position:0%
judicial branch if we were to
um

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:44.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:46.390 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
to move to change those rules
 
00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
um I think we would quickly find
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves before the courts which seems
 
00:40:59.810 --> 00:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
a little uh something that's full of
 
00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:01.609 align:start position:0%
a little uh something that's full of
irony

00:41:01.609 --> 00:41:01.619 align:start position:0%
irony
 
00:41:01.619 --> 00:41:03.890 align:start position:0%
irony
um

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
I look forward to working with this
 
00:41:10.609 --> 00:41:10.619 align:start position:0%
committee with members from both the
 
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
Children and Family Services the
 
00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:16.460 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee that
 
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
has one perspective and one line of
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
experience and members of the Judiciary
 
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
Committee that have another set of
 
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
experiences and knowledge because I
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
think together
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
we could create a very rich and deep
 
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
understanding of the complexities that
 
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
we face in society today and that are
 
00:41:42.849 --> 00:41:42.859 align:start position:0%
reflected in the incredible challenges
 
00:41:46.329 --> 00:41:46.339 align:start position:0%
uh faced by the Family Division
 
00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
we might find that the Family Division
 
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
is suffering because of lack of
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
resources and that is something that
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
falls specifically within the venue of
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch in terms of
 
00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:08.420 align:start position:0%
creating positions and in terms of of
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
financing and that's a perfectly
 
00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:14.220 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing for us to do I also
 
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
think that we can serve and very
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
important function in giving people an
 
00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.430 align:start position:0%
important function in giving people an
opportunity

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:26.220 align:start position:0%
to articulate their concerns and know
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
that somebody is listening to those
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
concerns as long as they are presented
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
in a way that the chair so
 
00:42:40.609 --> 00:42:40.619 align:start position:0%
thoroughly uh discussed not to retry a
 
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
case but to see where there might be
 
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
what could be called a pattern or
 
00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:46.930 align:start position:0%
what could be called a pattern or
practice

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:46.940 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
that gets in the way of the family court
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
doing what we would hope the family
 
00:42:59.890 --> 00:42:59.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
pre-judging I come here with the same
 
00:43:04.849 --> 00:43:04.859 align:start position:0%
feelings that any one of us might have
 
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:07.140 align:start position:0%
as Citizens about yeah I like that
 
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
decision or no I don't like that
 
00:43:13.069 --> 00:43:13.079 align:start position:0%
decision but without believing that
 
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
there are institutional
 
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:17.530 align:start position:0%
there are institutional
um

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:17.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
factors about those those decisions and
 
00:43:25.849 --> 00:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
I I know that I I am convinced that at
 
00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
the end of this practice under the
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
leadership of the chair
 
00:43:33.609 --> 00:43:33.619 align:start position:0%
this committee will calmly
 
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
intelligently thoughtfully and in a very
 
00:43:38.589 --> 00:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
balanced way
 
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
identify ways that we in the legislature
 
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
can do a better job legislating and
 
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
therefore hoping that that will help the
 
00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:49.849 align:start position:0%
therefore hoping that that will help the
Judiciary

00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:49.859 align:start position:0%
Judiciary
 
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
doing a better job adjudicating so I
 
00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:56.099 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening and I am looking
 
00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
forward to hearing what others say
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Vice chair in terms of
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
the bill that passed I believe
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
unanimously it was house resolution 14
 
00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.329 align:start position:0%
unanimously it was house resolution 14
and

00:44:11.329 --> 00:44:11.339 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:14.220 align:start position:0%
um it looked good in a lot of ways but
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
we were informed that a couple of items
 
00:44:19.809 --> 00:44:19.819 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
were in violation of either house rules
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
or something else and at that point and
 
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:29.220 align:start position:0%
I I believe
 
00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:32.060 align:start position:0%
Madam Vice chair you you were very much
 
00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
conversing with the speaker as well I
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
said that the request of a committee
 
00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
that house resolution 14 spoke of is
 
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
something I'd like to go forward and so
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
collectively that's why we're here is
 
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
the real gist the real meat of house
 
00:44:53.329 --> 00:44:53.339 align:start position:0%
resolution 14
 
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
um here we are anyone else on the
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
committee yes the chair counselor
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
so I appreciated your comments I'm
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
honored to be appointed to this
 
00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
committee I did want to just point out
 
00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:11.390 align:start position:0%
committee I did want to just point out
since

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:45:13.609 --> 00:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
and we can talk about this later but I
 
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
think in your opening remarks you said
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
that anyway I am a practicing attorney
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
in the Family Division and I am a
 
00:45:20.329 --> 00:45:20.339 align:start position:0%
certified Guardian Ad Litem in the
 
00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
Family Division it's only about 20 maybe
 
00:45:25.609 --> 00:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
30 now of my practice but just based on
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
the comments that you had made I I had
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
been vetted with my leadership and you
 
00:45:31.609 --> 00:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
and I had talked and I didn't see that
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
being a practicing member would
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
disqualify me but if it does perhaps we
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
can talk about that you passed my wadia
 
00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:38.339 align:start position:0%
counselor okay
 
00:45:40.609 --> 00:45:40.619 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
yes uh con this may embarrass you but
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
then again you are a lawyer so maybe it
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
won't but uh I did ask you some push
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
questions to try to see if in my opinion
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
you could be a disinterested party and
 
00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
you pass with flying colors
 
00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much welcome do my best
 
00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
anyone else says we
 
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:12.050 align:start position:0%
anyone else says we
begin

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
wow

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
wow
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
I am expecting a tsunami of pink cards
 
00:46:20.329 --> 00:46:20.339 align:start position:0%
starting next week I have no pink cards
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
here nobody has come indicating you wish
 
00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
to testify I hope I didn't scare you off
 
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
but I do hope okay would you fill out a
 
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
and remember the kind of testimony that
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
meanwhile counselor you may be
 
00:46:56.569 --> 00:46:56.579 align:start position:0%
interested I'm reading several
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
equivalents of
 
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
introductory to law for idiots I'm
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
really plugging through it I've watched
 
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
22 years of Law and Order knowing the
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
differences and I'm really trying to get
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
up to speed on this and no I'm not going
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
to law school but I did pass a practice
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
LSAT exam
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
maybe you could pass those books on to
 
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
me and I could see if I could learn a
 
00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Paula
 
00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
or worma were me and um I'll start my
 
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
watch you got five minutes and just
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
remember the parameters in which you may
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
testify okay yes sir
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I witnessed a terrible Injustice in
 
00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
the family court
 
00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
in a case where the court didn't even
 
00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
have subject matter jurisdiction
 
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
uh three separate judges basically
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
stripped a protective parent of custody
 
00:48:11.569 --> 00:48:11.579 align:start position:0%
and then they proceeded to scare her
 
00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
straight out of the state
 
00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:17.300 align:start position:0%
and handed custody to the abusive ex
 
00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
then they basically or ransacked her
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
half of the marital State and gave it to
 
00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
the husband
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
as a result of this terrible Injustice I
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
decided I was going to do an audit on
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
the courts
 
00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
I basically sold my home built out a van
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
to live in and drove up here last fall
 
00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm here again still auditing the
 
00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:41.630 align:start position:0%
and I'm here again still auditing the
courts

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
courts
 
00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:45.180 align:start position:0%
I wish to be recognized as an expert
 
00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
to testify for the length of time is Mr
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
head I know what's going on I know the
 
00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:54.829 align:start position:0%
head I know what's going on I know the
reasons

00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
have already raised an issue of three
 
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
judges stripping a parent of custody you
 
00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:05.780 align:start position:0%
have not provided name date time place
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
specifics it is not it is not
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:16.740 align:start position:0%

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
organizational meeting yes it is I'm
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
just telling you that I understand
 
00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
statutory reasons for what is going on
 
00:49:29.329 --> 00:49:29.339 align:start position:0%
is wrong I understand constitutional
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
reasons I understand the reasons the
 
00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
judges are violating the rules I
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
understand that in general and I've
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
looked at probably 150 to 200 of these
 
00:49:43.309 --> 00:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
cases they don't issue scheduling orders
 
00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
and that's why some of these cases are
 
00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
carrying on for 15 years they never
 
00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
schedule something for trial I can bring
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
you specific instances when it's time to
 
00:49:55.849 --> 00:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
bring in testimony when it's time to
 
00:49:59.329 --> 00:49:59.339 align:start position:0%
bring in testimony uh yes please do the
 
00:50:01.849 --> 00:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
rules I've articulated will be in place
 
00:50:05.329 --> 00:50:05.339 align:start position:0%
okay but my point here today is I need
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
more than five minutes I would like as
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
amount of time you will have to prove
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%

work at the Supreme Court where I've
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
whatever information and research I can
 
00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:51.900 align:start position:0%

00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
I don't know what else to tell you I I
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
do have some background in the Family

Division in that I
 
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
my youngest child came to our family
 
00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
when he was eight so I've been through
 
00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.650 align:start position:0%
when he was eight so I've been through
the

00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:08.809 --> 00:52:08.819 align:start position:0%
in order to adopt him he was in the
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
foster care system so I have some
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
experience with that
 
00:52:12.599 --> 00:52:13.430 align:start position:0%
experience with that
um

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:14.809 --> 00:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
I don't know what else to tell you
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
before I was with the house I was with
 
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
what position do you hold with the
 
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I'm the reporter of
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
decisions and would you explain I know
 
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
what that is because you you taught me
 
00:52:28.609 --> 00:52:28.619 align:start position:0%
what that is but would you explain in
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
case anyone else doesn't know I think my
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
prelim my sort of primary responsibility
 
00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
there is to oversee the issuance of
 
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
opinions and orders but I I do do a lot
 
00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:42.380 align:start position:0%
of research for the court and Drafting
 
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
and I I
 
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
at the current time I am the secretary
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
for the administer the advisory
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
committee on rules but I will be
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
I will be giving that position to Tim
 
00:53:00.049 --> 00:53:00.059 align:start position:0%
goodis our clerk our the clerk of the
 
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:02.220 align:start position:0%
court so that I can better serve this
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
committee will you be replacing attorney
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
head as the liaison to our committees
 
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:10.140 align:start position:0%
not this committee but the ones we come
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
from I don't I don't know how that's
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
going to work I've only been asked to
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
staff this particular committee
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
um okay I take my guidance from Diane
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
Martin and the Chief Justice if we're
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
nice to you
 
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
maybe you'll do it
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
I current I up until very recently I was
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
working many more than 40 hours a week
 
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
so I have been trying to with their
 
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
support curtail my work but to the
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
extent that I can help anybody I that
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
really is something I'd like to do
 
00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
for going forward and you can certainly
 
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
if you haven't already begin the
 
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:51.410 align:start position:0%
if you haven't already begin the
research

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:53:56.329 --> 00:53:56.339 align:start position:0%
it's the several specific charges that
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
are made against Family Court
 
00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.250 align:start position:0%
are made against Family Court
um

00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
the judges all seem to lean over
 
00:54:07.609 --> 00:54:07.619 align:start position:0%
backwards to favor the ones who are pro
 
00:54:07.619 --> 00:54:08.630 align:start position:0%
backwards to favor the ones who are pro
se

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
se
 
00:54:11.329 --> 00:54:11.339 align:start position:0%
or the judges don't like people who are
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
pro se well those those are obviously
 
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
two different charges or
 
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
um Rules of Evidence aren't being
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
followed or scheduling protocols aren't
 
00:54:25.849 --> 00:54:25.859 align:start position:0%
being where there is an allegation that
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
seems to be coming from several people
 
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.309 align:start position:0%
seems to be coming from several people
um

00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
what are the rules
 
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
what other protocols why is the delay is
 
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
it fair or unfair that something is put
 
00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.210 align:start position:0%
it fair or unfair that something is put
out

00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.220 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:43.740 align:start position:0%
three years
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
um someone who has complained to us
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
saying why every time I go to court the
 
00:54:52.609 --> 00:54:52.619 align:start position:0%
opposite one brings in five more
 
00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
petitions why does the judge hear that
 
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
and not just say enough we're done those
 
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
kinds of questions about procedures
 
00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
um I I know for example what was what my
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
vice chair articulated the reason
 
00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
sometimes things are taking time is
 
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
there's not enough judges and I think we
 
00:55:11.809 --> 00:55:11.819 align:start position:0%
got seven more coming to Circuit Court
 
00:55:14.329 --> 00:55:14.339 align:start position:0%
if this budget keeps that in and is
 
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:16.740 align:start position:0%
signed into law so there are answers to
 
00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
some of the questions uh those would be
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
good topics to start the research on and
 
00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:26.420 align:start position:0%
as you listen to testimony here
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
you'll start to hear Trends too and
 
00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:31.140 align:start position:0%
certainly you can talk with the the
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
clerks of the committee and they can say
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
oh we've got six things in the folder
 
00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
Mark such and such that would be good to
 
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
start formulating
 
00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
um some answers
 
00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:47.510 align:start position:0%
um some answers
okay

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
for what it's worth as I understand that
 
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch at some point will
 
00:55:56.089 --> 00:55:56.099 align:start position:0%
come over and the judges would I think
 
00:55:58.370 --> 00:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
some of them would come and answer some
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
of your questions also
 
00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:02.420 align:start position:0%
I I don't know when you want to do that
 
00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
as I've as I'm working on scheduling of
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholder groups we've got different
 
00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:11.700 align:start position:0%
stakeholder groups which are enumerated
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
um the memo establishing this committee
 
00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
and I've asked my uh committee
 
00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
researcher who is doing the scheduling
 
00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
to not bring the uh Judiciary over early
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
in the process we want to hear from as
 
00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:34.859 align:start position:0%
many people as can do it I see rightly
 
00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:38.900 align:start position:0%
their information their their complaints
 
00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
only then can the Judiciary come and
 
00:56:43.319 --> 00:56:45.109 align:start position:0%
only then can the Judiciary come and
explain

00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
explain
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
um I am heartened and this does not
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
Prejudice My ultimate decision but I am
 
00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:54.260 align:start position:0%

00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:12.180 align:start position:0%

00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
they how the judicial checks themselves
 
00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
uh may be helpful I know that sticks out
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
in my mind that
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
I mean we're here and I you know judge X
 
00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:53.220 align:start position:0%
decided this way
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
my friends the same case as mine and
 
00:57:59.870 --> 00:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
judge W decided this way what wise I
 
00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
don't think they like me you know so so
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh and the same with uh judicial review
 
00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
um inconsistencies with that also so
 
00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:11.210 align:start position:0%
um inconsistencies with that also so
just

00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:11.220 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:58:15.049 --> 00:58:15.059 align:start position:0%
a heads up on what uh the chairman also
 
00:58:19.069 --> 00:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful at
 
00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
some point
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
for you or someone from Judiciary to
 
00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
explain to us to the degree
 
00:58:35.089 --> 00:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
in other words no betrayals of
 
00:58:38.569 --> 00:58:38.579 align:start position:0%
confidence obviously
 
00:58:41.329 --> 00:58:41.339 align:start position:0%
how your
 
00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
um and I keep blanking out the name it's
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
the the group the committee that
 
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
investigates the possibility that a
 
00:58:50.809 --> 00:58:50.819 align:start position:0%
judge has gone bad the judicial combat
 
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
committee that's the room to know how
 
00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
that works okay I mean if you can wing
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
it now fine if not come back
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
I'd prefer not to wait because obviously
 
00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.010 align:start position:0%
I'd prefer not to wait because obviously
um

00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
there's private information
 
00:59:09.049 --> 00:59:09.059 align:start position:0%
and should be private and having been
 
00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
privy in my day work line of work to
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
serving as a judge on one of those
 
00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.470 align:start position:0%
serving as a judge on one of those
things

00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
I I do know the process of how it works
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
and the confidentialities that are
 
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
important but it would perhaps be
 
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
um a relief to some members of the
 
00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
public to know that there is such a
 
00:59:30.359 --> 00:59:31.250 align:start position:0%
public to know that there is such a
thing

00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
and how it works and what you look for
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
that would be very helpful I think for
 
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
some folks
 
00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:40.430 align:start position:0%
some folks
um

00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman you made me think
 
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
of a question
 
00:59:47.329 --> 00:59:47.339 align:start position:0%
um and actually then you started to ask
 
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:50.220 align:start position:0%
a similar thing so on one thing that
 
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:52.140 align:start position:0%
we've heard uh multiple times that I
 
00:59:53.569 --> 00:59:53.579 align:start position:0%
don't really think I need more evidence
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
of but is people saying that recordings
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
are being stopped and I know that in
 
01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
other states on these kind of oversight
 
01:00:03.049 --> 01:00:03.059 align:start position:0%
committees and stuff they have people
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
that will go sit in random like
 
01:00:06.289 --> 01:00:06.299 align:start position:0%
courtrooms and stuff that are actually
 
01:00:08.809 --> 01:00:08.819 align:start position:0%
from the judicial branch to see if the
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
recordings are being stopped kind of
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
like a guest teacher or something is
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
there any kind of observation that we
 
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
have in the judicial system that looks
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
for stuff like that because there have
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
been specific incidents as we've seen of
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff either they think
 
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
it's on record and supposedly the judge
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
stopped the recording or and then we've
 
01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
heard that they can't stop that so I'm
 
01:00:33.289 --> 01:00:33.299 align:start position:0%
really interested to hear more about
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
kind of how that goes and if there's any
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
observation or protocol for kind of
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
regulating that kind of stuff
 
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for underscoring that anyone
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
who is watching the video of this who
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
believes this took place because we did
 
01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:50.339 align:start position:0%
hear some a few examples of that in
 
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
children family law committee we would
 
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
like to know what day what court what
 
01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
time so that we can review the tape or
 
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
at least ask a court administrative
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
officer what happened
 
01:01:04.079 --> 01:01:04.730 align:start position:0%
officer what happened
um

01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:07.309 align:start position:0%
um
also

01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
we would like to schedule a road trip to
 
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
sit in on Family Court
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh it's probably going to be very
 
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to all keep our mouth
 
01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
shut but we'll try
 
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
and speak with someone afterwards
 
01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
obviously not to review the case we just
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
heard but from that in other cases we
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
may have witnessed generalized questions
 
01:01:36.289 --> 01:01:36.299 align:start position:0%
and then this this occurred to me late
 
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
at night when I was reading one of my
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
intro to law books
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
what about moot court or mock Court
 
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
depending on which term you like where I
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
mean we do this in the legislature for
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
new legislators on how to not behave in
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
the legislature when we're having a
 
01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
session and you know we'll have somebody
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
cross in front of the speaker and you
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
know all of those things you're not
 
01:02:02.569 --> 01:02:02.579 align:start position:0%
supposed to do to show us what we're not
 
01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to do not just by giving you a
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
list of rules but actually having a play
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
and so something like moot court or mock
 
01:02:12.049 --> 01:02:12.059 align:start position:0%
court that could bring out a typical
 
01:02:15.049 --> 01:02:15.059 align:start position:0%
family court case
 
01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:17.180 align:start position:0%
with actors
 
01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
derived from a conflation of numbers of
 
01:02:24.049 --> 01:02:24.059 align:start position:0%
cases so we're not retrying an exact
 
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
case but a generalized one with
 
01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
subtitles running commentary uh that
 
01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
would be worth the price of the
 
01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:35.579 align:start position:0%
admission I think if some point uh you
 
01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
could get some law students to do that
 
01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:40.789 align:start position:0%
for us
oh

01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to pursue that that's an
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
interesting idea we have interns at the
 
01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court uh-huh
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh and the chair now recognizes uh
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
anybody from the committee who wishes to
 
01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
ask further questions of
 
01:02:56.099 --> 01:02:56.870 align:start position:0%
ask further questions of
um

01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
you're an attorney I'm going to believe
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
right yes okay councilor Platt thank you
 
01:03:02.089 --> 01:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
for coming
 
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Rudy
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I've totally blanked your name
 
01:03:19.849 --> 01:03:19.859 align:start position:0%
Bernardi I knew that
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you representative JD Bernardi
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 36.
 
01:03:36.829 --> 01:03:36.839 align:start position:0%
um so I was the sponsor of HR 14.
 
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
um I am not an aggrieved party in any
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
family law uh
 
01:03:42.359 --> 01:03:44.270 align:start position:0%
family law uh
condition

01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
condition
 
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
um I became aware of issues in the
 
01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:51.299 align:start position:0%
family court system by campaigning when
 
01:03:54.049 --> 01:03:54.059 align:start position:0%
I campaign I knock on doors I ask
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
questions about the uh my constituents
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
or potential constituents what is
 
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
bothering you about issues in New
 
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whether it be taxation or
 
01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
whatever uh Second Amendment or and it's
 
01:04:14.329 --> 01:04:14.339 align:start position:0%
issues that they raise they raised
 
01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
with a reasonable frequency problems in
 
01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
the Family Law Court you know that that
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
were unique to them so I became a
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the legislation
 
01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
to essentially see if we can get to the
 
01:04:35.410 --> 01:04:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:38.809 --> 01:04:38.819 align:start position:0%
legitimate number of due process issues
 
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
and I say legitimate in that I just
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
didn't take this on because I heard
 
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.450 align:start position:0%
didn't take this on because I heard
complaints

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:46.460 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
I actually met with these folks in
 
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
meetings and we reviewed physical
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
documents of here's the judge's decision
 
01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
here's the cases here's the problems
 
01:05:03.370 --> 01:05:03.380 align:start position:0%
that where where there were uh
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
seeming divergences from some sort of
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
semblance of what I considered
 
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
reasonable Behavior
 
01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
my opinion
 
01:05:17.569 --> 01:05:17.579 align:start position:0%
but that was the Genesis and the
 
01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
rationale for bringing forward H.R 14.
 
01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:23.150 align:start position:0%
rationale for bringing forward H.R 14.
um

01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
the need for subpoena power well you can
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
argue one way or another I thought it
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
was necessary in order to get
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
um some answers when answers were not
 
01:05:34.799 --> 01:05:37.309 align:start position:0%
um some answers when answers were not
forthcoming

01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
forthcoming
 
01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:39.740 align:start position:0%
but if the Judiciary is going to be
 
01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
responsive then we'll get those answers
 
01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
the issue that I have today is this is
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
the first time there's been an
 
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for what I would call a
 
01:05:52.609 --> 01:05:52.619 align:start position:0%
charter or how this committee is going
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
to operate and its expectations we're
 
01:05:57.890 --> 01:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
just hearing it for the first time
 
01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:58.609 align:start position:0%
just hearing it for the first time
um

01:05:58.609 --> 01:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
the people that need to testify that
 
01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
have the specific experiences that
 
01:06:05.809 --> 01:06:05.819 align:start position:0%
you're asking for
 
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
don't know this yet so there needs to be
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
some way to publish and get that
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
information out to them that you are
 
01:06:20.569 --> 01:06:20.579 align:start position:0%
looking for X Y and Z and and please
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
come to this committee and make that
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
case now I don't I don't know if that is
 
01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
publishable in the calendar or uh you
 
01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
know some other place but
 
01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.950 align:start position:0%
know some other place but
um

01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
the testimony child and family law heard
 
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
on on various bills there was a targeted
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
bill that would dealt with uh
 
01:06:48.599 --> 01:06:49.490 align:start position:0%
bill that would dealt with uh
um

01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
issue a b or c and people came and
 
01:06:56.089 --> 01:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
testified on that this seems to be all
 
01:06:58.250 --> 01:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
right the door is thrown open to
 
01:07:02.329 --> 01:07:02.339 align:start position:0%
potentially anything but what things and
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
what what do you want so you uh chairman
 
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
Pearson went over a selected list of
 
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.210 align:start position:0%
Pearson went over a selected list of
criteria

01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:11.930 align:start position:0%
criteria
um

01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
I I do I do think that needs to be fully
 
01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
published and made available so people
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
know and the dates that you're having
 
01:07:23.809 --> 01:07:23.819 align:start position:0%
hearings so they can potentially plan
 
01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:27.020 align:start position:0%
take time off from work or whatever
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
activities they may have and and show up
 
01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:34.220 align:start position:0%
and and actually present the information
 
01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:37.460 align:start position:0%
that they need to present so you can
 
01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
interrogate the uh issue further I have
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
a press release ready to go just waiting
 
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
for this specific day it's committee
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
meeting to end I just wanted to hear a
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
little bit more from my colleagues I was
 
01:07:55.010 --> 01:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
intending to speak more specifically
 
01:07:56.690 --> 01:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
with some of them over the weekend but
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
it was the weekend from hell but the
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
press release is ready to go which will
 
01:08:04.609 --> 01:08:04.619 align:start position:0%
do exactly that say when where give the
 
01:08:06.529 --> 01:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
rules to the road and I do hope the
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
newspapers publish it
 
01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:09.230 align:start position:0%
newspapers publish it
um

01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
as I send it out because it is designed
 
01:08:15.289 --> 01:08:15.299 align:start position:0%
to do exactly what you suggest secondly
 
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
I will ask my committee researcher and
 
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
it may be either you or my committee
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
assistant to go back to those retained
 
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
bills and children and family law and
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
find the pink cards and see those pink
 
01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:33.179 align:start position:0%
cards who came to testify as a aggrieved
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
individual if this contact information
 
01:08:38.890 --> 01:08:38.900 align:start position:0%
so that they can be contacted and
 
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
informed this thing is rolling and then
 
01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
thirdly representative you really did
 
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
your homework and those people who you
 
01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
sat down with who produce documents uh
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
call them let them know
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
we are scheduled to meet the first four
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays of May 2 9 16 23 maybe the
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
first three Tuesday Mornings of June but
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
that way they'll know ahead of time
 
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
so one additional question then could
 
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
you potentially publish your
 
01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:13.930 align:start position:0%
you potentially publish your
um

01:09:13.930 --> 01:09:13.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
editorial or whatever in the calendar as
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
listed you know normally we list a bill
 
01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
and what were subject matters being
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
discussed if that could also be in the
 
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
calendar with with the specificity that
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
you went over the kind of information
 
01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
you're looking for so people who follow
 
01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
the legislature can look there and
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
identify yes there's
 
01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
this is how it's going to work
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
I will speak to the clerk of the house
 
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
we what a notice is I've already
 
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
submitted the dates for May and if I
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
misspoke it was it's not the first
 
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
second and third of June it's the first
 
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
second and third Tuesdays of June so
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's a whole bunch of Tuesdays but not
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
the 30th of May I will speak to the
 
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
clerk if you would speak to your
 
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
constituents we'll try to find the ones
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
who testified if there are similar
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
bills about the Judiciary that came to
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee maybe you can
 
01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
ask for the pink cards to be researched
 
01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:21.830 align:start position:0%
ask for the pink cards to be researched
and

01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
press release we'll go out this
 
01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
afternoon if you can think of any other
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
way to get the word out there let me
 
01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.649 align:start position:0%
way to get the word out there let me
know

01:10:30.649 --> 01:10:30.659 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
just in the calendar that's it thank you
 
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
okay and thank you and it was only on
 
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
two very minor points but were deemed to
 
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
be disqualifiers that the H.R 14
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
resolution was
 
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
um tabled everything else as you know
 
01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:48.900 align:start position:0%
sailed out of here
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
we didn't know until later there were a
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
couple of disqualifiers so here we are
 
01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
here's the committee H.R 14 I hope
 
01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.030 align:start position:0%
here's the committee H.R 14 I hope
wanted

01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.970 --> 01:11:15.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
is this on good morning Mr chair
 
01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
uh forgive me I wasn't prepared to speak
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
today if you're not in Conformity with
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
the house rules I'll give you your pink
 
01:11:29.290 --> 01:11:29.300 align:start position:0%
card back
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
but uh I just wanted to address what I
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
heard from Miss Platt okay I think a
 
01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
little Clarity on who is doing what over
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
at the judicial branch right now might
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
be very helpful
 
01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
I wrote an email to Mr head yesterday
 
01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
concerning whether an audio recording
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be 10 or 20 minutes I
 
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
could give you date time docket number
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
I sort of planned on discussing that
 
01:11:58.689 --> 01:11:58.699 align:start position:0%
offline with him
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh but just a little more clarity on
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
what's going on and who we can bring
 
01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
these issues to at this time would be
 
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
helpful if you'd like the tame Diamond
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
docket number that I can give it to you
 
01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
otherwise that's all I have to say when
 
01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
it's time to make your presentation
 
01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
after you've done any Consulting and I
 
01:12:19.729 --> 01:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
do appreciate your doing that we get a
 
01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
lot of people coming through here who
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
have not done their homework thank you
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
for trying to do yours yeah it's an
 
01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
issue of who do I do it with the
 
01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
judicial branch thank you
 
01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:30.350 align:start position:0%
judicial branch thank you
okay

01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
um I don't know the house rules over
 
01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
there but um perhaps Council can let him
 
01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
know if this is admissible and if so who
 
01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
he speaks with so maybe you could have a
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
little you know next party afterwards
 
01:12:42.239 --> 01:12:44.330 align:start position:0%
little you know next party afterwards
perfect

01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
thank you and the chair recognizes
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
Joseph J is it Nugent
 
01:12:52.490 --> 01:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
okay I think it was the last time I read
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
then it wasn't you have similar
 
01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:00.229 align:start position:0%
then it wasn't you have similar
handwriting

01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
handwriting
 
01:13:03.169 --> 01:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Joseph Nugent I
 
01:13:05.689 --> 01:13:05.699 align:start position:0%
live in Effingham I wanted to just start
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
this is the first time I've ever
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
testified here in Concord okay but I am
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
very grateful for the process of this
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
special committee uh beginning I know
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
that today is just an introductory day
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
I did have a question whether or not
 
01:13:21.649 --> 01:13:21.659 align:start position:0%
people might be able to testify more
 
01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
than one time before the committee in
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
their five minutes because unfortunately
 
01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:28.460 align:start position:0%
I have a family case that's become very
 
01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
complex and I'm not sure that the issues
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
could fairly be addressed in only one
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
five-minute presentation but well why
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
don't we try you for one and if you do
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
conform to the the ways of we're
 
01:13:44.570 --> 01:13:44.580 align:start position:0%
receiving testimony
 
01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
um what we'll do is hear from others and
 
01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
then we'll
 
01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
if you did a good job the first time
 
01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
we'll give you a second maybe a third
 
01:13:54.169 --> 01:13:54.179 align:start position:0%
bite of the Apple
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
good and I'm hoping that that doesn't
 
01:13:57.890 --> 01:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
become necessary unfortunately I think
 
01:13:59.630 --> 01:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
that some of the issues might be so
 
01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
preliminarily today I didn't want to
 
01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
miss an opportunity to have the
 
01:14:05.689 --> 01:14:05.699 align:start position:0%
microphone where we had time before noon
 
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
I did have concerns about due process
 
01:14:11.709 --> 01:14:11.719 align:start position:0%
and irregularities in my family case
 
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
and I just believe that in general this
 
01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
is an important check and balance from
 
01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
what I found from enduring the family
 
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
court here in New Hampshire
 
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
that without a check and balance that's
 
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
instrumental in our government
 
01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
problems occur and specifically in my
 
01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
case I'm very concerned about an RSA
 
01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.010 align:start position:0%
case I'm very concerned about an RSA
regarding

01:14:36.010 --> 01:14:36.020 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
access to 9-1-1 calls
 
01:14:42.169 --> 01:14:42.179 align:start position:0%
so there's a rule in New Hampshire
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
that's affected my family case and my
 
01:14:47.209 --> 01:14:47.219 align:start position:0%
relationship with my nine my now almost
 
01:14:50.689 --> 01:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
11 year old child where the situation
 
01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
where my son had been taken from me was
 
01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:55.370 align:start position:0%
where my son had been taken from me was
recorded

01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
by e911
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
however the legislature here has passed
 
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
a rule that doesn't allow for the
 
01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
issuance of that 9-1-1 call
 
01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
without a judge's signature
 
01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:14.219 align:start position:0%
now I've made this this request in many
 
01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
motions before the family court and
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
before our Supreme Court during my
 
01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
appeal process even our Supreme Court
 
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
has denied me the the 9-1-1 call now
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
I've had evidence which when I have more
 
01:15:32.689 --> 01:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
chance to prepare I will provide
 
01:15:34.729 --> 01:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
evidence to this committee that shows
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
that the situation was a 10-minute phone
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
call this is done on a time and dated
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
stamped uh piece of computer paper
 
01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
ticker that comes out at the County
 
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
office where the 9-1-1 calls go through
 
01:15:50.689 --> 01:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
and during the resulting criminal
 
01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
process of my case where I was charged
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
with domestic violence I was charged
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
with even hitting my son which was
 
01:16:01.450 --> 01:16:01.460 align:start position:0%
thrown out of court
 
01:16:05.689 --> 01:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
this 9-1-1 call is evidence but I was
 
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
only provided during the criminal
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
Discovery process for six minutes and
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
seven seconds of this call
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
it was altered because it was not
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
provided to me so the issue that I'd
 
01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
like to bring before the legislature is
 
01:16:21.169 --> 01:16:21.179 align:start position:0%
to show that there's a flaw in the law
 
01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
in my opinion that comes out of this
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
legislature that allows our state and
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
our government to withhold evidence from
 
01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
the public from a person who's a part of
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
the call so as the committee looks at
 
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
rules to perhaps re-evaluate or
 
01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
additional legislation to provide in the
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
future I didn't want to miss the
 
01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity to bring out that very
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
important case because this occurred
 
01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
when my son was four and a half years
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
old he's going to turn 11 in in May when
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
you come back it would be helpful to us
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
if you have the RSA number in your hand
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
for us it would be helpful if we know
 
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
the specific dates and time roughly time
 
01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
of the call and which judges turn down
 
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
your request it would be helpful in was
 
01:17:16.330 --> 01:17:16.340 align:start position:0%
there a criminal case or only a civil
 
01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.189 align:start position:0%
there a criminal case or only a civil
yes

01:17:18.189 --> 01:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
you want to show that I was found not
 
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
guilty by a jury of my peers who threw
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
out all the charges against me and I
 
01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
still have not been able to have
 
01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:30.060 align:start position:0%
unsupervised visitation with my child
 
01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
was there um was there in the discovery
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
phase of your criminal trial
 
01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.189 align:start position:0%
phase of your criminal trial
um

01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
are you saying it during Discovery all
 
01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
they got was six minutes and change the
 
01:17:44.689 --> 01:17:44.699 align:start position:0%
tape uh even with your attorney asking
 
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
for more yes this one right before I'm
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
going to stop now because it's starting
 
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
to move into retrying your case and
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
which is a valid thing to do but not for
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
this committee's purposes so when you
 
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
come back if you would have chapter and
 
01:18:00.649 --> 01:18:00.659 align:start position:0%
verse as much as you could how many
 
01:18:00.659 --> 01:18:02.390 align:start position:0%
verse as much as you could how many
times

01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.649 align:start position:0%
times
um

01:18:03.649 --> 01:18:03.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
a judge was asked to release more of the
 
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 call when who where and so on
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of specifics we need as
 
01:18:17.689 --> 01:18:17.699 align:start position:0%
we start to look at what changes need to
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
be made so I'll let you go now but you
 
01:18:23.209 --> 01:18:23.219 align:start position:0%
made a great start and
 
01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
um I will sure
 
01:18:26.689 --> 01:18:26.699 align:start position:0%
um yes the vice chair please
 
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh very much the point that
 
01:18:32.410 --> 01:18:32.420 align:start position:0%
you raised is a is an interesting point
 
01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
because it does show the difference
 
01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
between the legislative branch and the
 
01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
judicial branch in uh the Judiciary
 
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
Committee which actually meets in the
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
same room so I feel at home here we have
 
01:18:51.649 --> 01:18:51.659 align:start position:0%
had a number of bills relating to what
 
01:18:56.090 --> 01:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
can and cannot be released by 9-1-1 I'm
 
01:18:58.669 --> 01:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
not sure that children and family law
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
has had any of those so this is some an
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
issue that we're familiar with but if I
 
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
could just ask
 
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
um it's is it not true that you're
 
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
talking about more than one case one
 
01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
that would have been in in criminal
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
court and then one that would have been
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
in family court is that true
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
correct and in my particular instance
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative there the case was
 
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
divided because the DV charges against
 
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
Me In The Family Court civilly have
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
their own docket number they had their
 
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
own hearing the family court had a
 
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
different docket number
 
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
different proceedings there were
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
criminal charges made against me some
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
went in the district court and also
 
01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
before the superior court with appeals
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
that went in both from the family part
 
01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
of my case before The Supreme Court as
 
01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
well as the DV part of the case and this
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
is an instrumental piece of evidence
 
01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
that I'm still looking for now six years
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
later I realize how if I could sure
 
01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
please I realized how how painful this
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
is for you and how complex it is but I
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
would just remind you that this
 
01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
committee is looking exclusively at the
 
01:20:25.630 --> 01:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
Family Division of the Circuit Court
 
01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:27.290 align:start position:0%
Family Division of the Circuit Court
nothing

01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:28.930 align:start position:0%
nothing
here

01:20:28.930 --> 01:20:28.940 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
we have no Authority and no reason to be
 
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
looking at any actions in other courts
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
including of course the criminal courts
 
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
and uh District in yes I understand that
 
01:20:45.169 --> 01:20:45.179 align:start position:0%
so I just want to remind you of that for
 
01:20:46.850 --> 01:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
when you will look forward to hearing
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
from you when you come back yes thank
 
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
you for that because when this is
 
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
ultimately provided for me my
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
understanding of the Rules of Evidence
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
is that this will be information not
 
01:20:59.689 --> 01:20:59.699 align:start position:0%
available to me at the time of my
 
01:21:03.410 --> 01:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
hearings and will be instrumental in
 
01:21:06.169 --> 01:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
asking for a new trial so that's why
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
this is so important for me to somehow
 
01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
get attention to this matter to provide
 
01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
this important evidence so that I can
 
01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
try to resurrect a relationship with my
 
01:21:20.570 --> 01:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
son thank you Mr Newton any anyone else
 
01:21:22.450 --> 01:21:22.460 align:start position:0%
in the committee
 
01:21:24.649 --> 01:21:24.659 align:start position:0%
just curious
 
01:21:27.410 --> 01:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
um was the evidence that was admitted in
 
01:21:29.209 --> 01:21:29.219 align:start position:0%
the criminal case was that allowed to
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
come into your Civil Trial
 
01:21:34.729 --> 01:21:34.739 align:start position:0%
it was not allowed to come in to the
 
01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
Civil Trial
 
01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the due process area
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
that this committee is trying to take a
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
look at where there were due process
 
01:21:44.689 --> 01:21:44.699 align:start position:0%
violations and in my opinion these
 
01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
happen because there is no check and
 
01:21:49.010 --> 01:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
balance and my concern is for many other
 
01:21:51.890 --> 01:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
parents who faced this I did it really
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to cut you off that that
 
01:21:56.450 --> 01:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
was a specific question I wanted to know
 
01:21:59.209 --> 01:21:59.219 align:start position:0%
that if evidence was admissible in the
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
criminal case
 
01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
to what degree was that not allowed into
 
01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
your civil case and don't answer the
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
question now but answer it when you come
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
back please okay thank you
 
01:22:12.830 --> 01:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony
 
01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
well I don't see anything else before us
 
01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:16.380 align:start position:0%

01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
