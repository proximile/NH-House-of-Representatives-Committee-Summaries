00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
this this meeting was noticed in the
 
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
house calendar uh the focus we're gonna
 
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
put on it today is really
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh walking through
 
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 2.
 
00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
even though
 
00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
we've had people come and talk to us
 
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
about their house bills house bill 2
 
00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
proposals we've never done any level
 
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
setting between the committee members
 
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
given that we
 
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
intend to break at 2 30 because uh
 
00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
we have committee members with other
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
obligations this afternoon we don't
 
00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 align:start position:0%
really have time to to get into the
 
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
details of each of the items
 
00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
so what i think we can do is go through
 
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
every issue
 
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.830 align:start position:0%
every issue
once

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
once
 
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh on kind of a
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
a treetop level
 
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
and and just get a sense on
 
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
if there are
 
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
if there are any committee members
 
00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 align:start position:0%
that have concerns about the house bill
 
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
or want to do additional research or
 
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
or if they're just fine with it as is
 
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
so um i've emailed you uh what i'm
 
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
looking at so
 
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.790 align:start position:0%
looking at so
um

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
so i won't i won't shh
 
00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
maybe i should share
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna go ahead and share maybe it'll
 
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
okay i think i'm sharing because i can't
 
00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
tell which document i'm sharing i think
 
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sharing one that says house bill 2
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
list is is that what's there and is it
 
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
big enough should i make it bigger
 
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
it's big enough it starts with number
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
20. it's in the index yes sir okay all
 
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.189 align:start position:0%
20. it's in the index yes sir okay all
right

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.629 align:start position:0%
right
so

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
so again
 
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think the purpose of this is
 
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
really to
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh to decide anything but just to get a
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
sense from from the uh committee
 
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
on uh if you have issues with it so when
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
i so when i come to one of them
 
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
what i'm i'm going to ask you to do
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
is to raise your hand
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
if you have
 
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
a possible amendment or you know
 
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
something that we we need to know
 
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.270 align:start position:0%
something that we we need to know
um

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
and if you're just generally okay with
 
00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:00.629 align:start position:0%
and if you're just generally okay with
the

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 as it's described you you
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
don't have to raise your hand that way
 
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
we can keep going
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
but anyone who raises their hand will
 
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to speak a little
 
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
bit about
 
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
what what what they think about the
 
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.110 align:start position:0%
what what what they think about the
section

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.830 align:start position:0%
section
so

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
um so let's give this a try i i will
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
start out with section 20
 
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
the sale of the lakes region facility
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
um there was a a proposal in there
 
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.870 align:start position:0%
um there was a a proposal in there
um

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.950 align:start position:0%
and i
i

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know the history on
 
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
the laconia
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
state park area or whatever it's
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
technically called
 
00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
but i do know that
 
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
senator french is working on an
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
amendment to that that particular
 
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.070 align:start position:0%
amendment to that that particular
section

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
and i don't even know
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
what he intends to do but i know that
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
he's uh coordinating with the state reps
 
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
in that area and that's everything i
 
00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.029 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
i think this is section 19. you you
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
probably maybe you were using the um
 
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
the draft
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
guilty is charged i use the draft i just
 
00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
i was just looking at the um trying to
 
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
look at the sections and this is the
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
laconia state school facility
 
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.909 align:start position:0%
laconia state school facility
and

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
i think this has been in here for for a
 
00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:25.990 align:start position:0%
i think this has been in here for for a
while

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
am i right kevin
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
i think it has been i'm not sure if
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
division one has acted on that section
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
okay so uh mr williams said yellow
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
highlighted it as a dhhs issue you think
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's a division
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
two issue
 
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
i think it was originally assigned to
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
division one
 
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
let me just take a look yes division one
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
has that one
 
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.790 align:start position:0%
has that one
yeah

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
we can just keep going then i think
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
so so representative wallner based on
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
that i'm going to assume that every one
 
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
of my numbers is one too high and i'll
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
correct them
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
and if
 
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
if you'll correct me if i do one wrong
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
i'd appreciate it did you have a
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up ma'am
 
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.390 align:start position:0%
follow-up ma'am
no

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
no that one was easy wasn't it we gave
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
it to division one
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i like that an action passed as an
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
action completed
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
uh okay so
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
this this next one was related to
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports from the commissioner
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
and i i didn't see an issue
 
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
and so i was just curious if uh
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
dhhs is uh going to object to it or if
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
there's any uh resistance on this one
 
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:39.919 align:start position:0%
representative wallner you have your
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
um i think that this one's been with us
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
for a while in um
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
past budgets also
 
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
so this has just become standard
 
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:57.750 align:start position:0%
so this has just become standard
boilerplate

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
i mean they don't they don't always do
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports even though we've told
 
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
so is there any reason for us to want to
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
modify it in any way
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
to start uh
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
penalizing them ten thousand dollars a
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
quarter or
 
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
are we
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
are we okay any good
 
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
will be okay with the language as is
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe they'll maybe they'll listen
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
this time
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
you do have uh well
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
karen had her hand raised in the
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative your hand is still up do
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up nope i'm putting it
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
down sorry
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
no problem so i'm gonna move on with
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
that with the summary note
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
that this is a boilerplate and uh we're
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
okay with the language
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
if you if you change your minds later uh
 
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
so the next one is section 21 i believe
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
department of hhs uh unfunded positions
 
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.509 align:start position:0%
department of hhs uh unfunded positions
and

00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:01.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
and it says authorization discussion
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
does does anyone have
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
yes uh two hands let's go uh i think he
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
went first representative erf what do
 
00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:16.839 align:start position:0%
you have to say
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
sir i was just gonna say we might want
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
to look at that one i really hadn't
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
okay so we're at this point you're just
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
saying we just need to look at it you
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a position on it
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
i don't yet have not really i should
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
honestly have not been through this yet
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
i probably should have but
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
all right no no
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative wilder your hand is up
 
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.670 align:start position:0%
representative wilder your hand is up
sir

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
yes because of uh all the money that is
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
has got to come out of this budget i
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
don't think we should remove this i
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
don't think we should accept this
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
because it just says go on and do the
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
hiring they can't find the people
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
they've had such rapid expansion there's
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
more expansion than the budget can
 
00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:56.310 align:start position:0%
more expansion than the budget can
sustain

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
sustain
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
and i think we need to do something and
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
this might be the place to say you know
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
freeze the hiring
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
don't fully don't fill the unfunded
 
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.630 align:start position:0%
don't fully don't fill the unfunded
positions

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
okay so for the people in the audience
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
who are getting nervous
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh where i type in here
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
all that all all the money that needs to
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
come out
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
this section may need to be eliminated
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
but how you should interpret that is we
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
have a conversation that we need to have
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
around this
 
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.269 align:start position:0%
around this
so

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:29.269 align:start position:0%
so
don't

00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't panic yet please
 
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.550 align:start position:0%
don't panic yet please
uh

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
do you have any other uh comments sir uh
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
sorry i'll lower my hand no i i just
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
for the good of trying to balance a
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
budget we can't uh allow all this
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
filling of unfunded positions
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
okay so um so time permitting uh
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
if we get to the end and we still have
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
some time
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
i think we can come back to a few of
 
00:11:55.839 --> 00:11:58.310 align:start position:0%
i think we can come back to a few of
these

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.870 align:start position:0%
all right
so

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh i think
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
section 21 and i'm not watching the uh
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
attendees mr ripple
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
are you watching the attendees i am
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
nobody has their hand up at the moment
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay and i i don't know how much we have
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
time we have to entertain
 
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.030 align:start position:0%
time we have to entertain
the

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
questions from the attendees but
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
if you if you see one that you think we
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
need to hear from um you know let me
 
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.629 align:start position:0%
need to hear from um you know let me
know

00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:27.509 align:start position:0%
know
okay

00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's because my goal is to get from the
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
top to the bottom
 
00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
at least once today
 
00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:34.150 align:start position:0%
at least once today
um

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
not just not to solve anything but just
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
to know
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
so section 22
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
this is a suspension of the foster
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
grandparent program
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
and i i know
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
that somebody has said something to us
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
about this but
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
does anyone know why
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
we're suspending
 
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
something that sounds so great a foster
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative walner
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
actually i think in past budgets we
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
when there was no funding available for
 
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.710 align:start position:0%
when there was no funding available for
it

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
it has been suspended but if i read this
 
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.829 align:start position:0%
it has been suspended but if i read this
one

00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
i think this actually repeals it
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
am i right kevin that's right this is an
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
outright repeal in past budgets it's
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
typically been suspended
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
in the current 2021 budget uh both
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
congregate housing and the foster
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
grandparent program were actually funded
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
i think you heard from the department
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
that they didn't request funding this
 
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
time around
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
and it looks like this time the decision
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
was made
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps by the governor's office perhaps
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
by the department i'm not sure to go for
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
an outright repeal rather than a
 
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.269 align:start position:0%
an outright repeal rather than a
suspension

00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
no i just would like to leave this one
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
open so that we can talk a little more
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to put your name on it so
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
that the next time we talk more about it
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
you'll start the conversation is that
 
00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:05.750 align:start position:0%
you'll start the conversation is that
okay

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.509 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
i think we're on section 23
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
and this is a repeal
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh relative to congregate services and
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
my questions were why and are there
 
00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:22.710 align:start position:0%
my questions were why and are there
objections

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
objections
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
i think if i could i think that section
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
came out i think that was all
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
consolidated into the new section 22.
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
so section 23 is now the social services
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
so we'll we'll have one conversation
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
very good so
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
the draft 25 is that now 23 or 24
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
this is a block grant cost of living
 
00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:00.550 align:start position:0%
this is a block grant cost of living
adjustments

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
for two
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
this is giving a cost of living
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
adjustment for the eligibility criteria
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
would raise
 
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.310 align:start position:0%
would raise
eligibility

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
in the cola that would be used would be
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
consistent with the federal colon that's
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
what i think is going on here is there
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
any is there any history or objection to
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
that that we need to hear are we okay
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
with this or
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
wait another second uh representative
 
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.749 align:start position:0%
wait another second uh representative
earth

00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
earth
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
is this something
 
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
new kevin that they've put in
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
this is not new it's been in before i'm
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
just checking now to see if the language
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
is the same as it was in the previous
 
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:54.150 align:start position:0%
is the same as it was in the previous
biennium

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
and then represent nordgren you you
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
can't ask a question or say something if
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
you want if you change your mind no i
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
was going to ask the same question keith
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
asked so
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
wait for kevin to figure it out
 
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.710 align:start position:0%
wait for kevin to figure it out
thanks

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
it looks
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm just i guess i just want to so
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
why would it be an hb
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
is this essentially giving raises to
 
00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:30.870 align:start position:0%
is this essentially giving raises to
certain

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
phrases is the wrong word but increasing
 
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.389 align:start position:0%
phrases is the wrong word but increasing
eligibility

00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
amounts this is this is one that if you
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
i would actually ask somebody from the
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
department to come in and explain this
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
if they're
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
if they're willing i'm not sure if john
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
okay let's see
 
00:16:45.199 --> 00:16:46.069 align:start position:0%
okay let's see
so

00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
john williams in the audience do you
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
want me to bring him in yes sir uh and
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
just to remember what we're trying to do
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
today we're just trying to do
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
drag a comb through this so that we know
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
which ones are okay and which ones we
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
have to work on later and i think we've
 
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
already heard enough that says we want
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
to come back to this when we
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
when we have time
 
00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:10.230 align:start position:0%
when we have time
okay

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
so but i will say that we'll come back
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
mr williams uh can lead that
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
all right so the 26 i think becomes
 
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.390 align:start position:0%
all right so the 26 i think becomes
24.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
24.
 
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.350 align:start position:0%
24.
and

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
uh this is about county reimbursement of
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
funds limitations on payments
 
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative irfi i imagine you
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
have things to say about this
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
so i had asked the question in my notes
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
how do these numbers change
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
based on our conversations
 
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
so so so next time we come back and we
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
spend time about this
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
we will you be ready to do uh kind of a
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
presentation on this section with your
 
00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.390 align:start position:0%
presentation on this section with your
recommendation

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
of keeping or changing the language
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments from the
 
00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.789 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments from the
committee

00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.029 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
quick question do we have a
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
date yet when we're going to be
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
discussing this particular thing again
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
or that would just be coming along at
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
okay we have scheduled um
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
a meeting every day between now and the
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
26th actually okay every monday through
 
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.710 align:start position:0%
26th actually okay every monday through
friday

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
friday
 
00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.669 align:start position:0%
friday
so

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:47.679 --> 00:18:48.789 align:start position:0%
so
so

00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
based on today
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
and this pass i wanted to
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
start to sort these because i'd like to
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead and vote some of them out just
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
so we're we quit talking about them and
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
so we can start focusing on the ones
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
that we need to focus on
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
so let me ask you this question answer
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
your question with a question
 
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
if you're going to lead this
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
conversation and talk to us about any
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
proposed changes to language how much
 
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
time do you need to prepare for that a
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
day's notice
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
two maybe but one certainly would be
 
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
good monday is two days from now right
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
monday but i definitely prepared for
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
monday yes
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
is monday your next plan meeting on hp2
 
00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:29.669 align:start position:0%
is monday your next plan meeting on hp2
we

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
if you look at the calendar
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
what mr ripple has had done for us is
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
he's had us
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
on the calendar scheduled to talk about
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
hb1 and hb2 every day between now and
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
the 24th
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
and he's working with janet to extend
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
that to the 25th and 26th just to handle
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
the worst case scenario
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
but so i believe that because it's in
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
the calendar as long as we stay within
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
the scope of the that topic we're okay
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
is is that correct mr ripple is that
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
your interpretation
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
it is i'm not sure that monday's meeting
 
00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:05.919 align:start position:0%
specifically says house bill one and two
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
but as long as it's a division work
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
session and it's noticed in the calendar
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
just so
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
is your plan to take up 832 again on
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
monday is that what you're thinking
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
right i might i'm not thinking anything
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
except i want to get all the way through
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
this list so that i know what we have on
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
our planet then you will let us know is
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
that accurate
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
yes okay thanks
 
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.630 align:start position:0%
yes okay thanks
yes

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.390 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to put representative
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
irf leads
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
and then i'll just go monday
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
so this
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
27 becomes 25 perspective repeal
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
regarding eligibility of services that's
 
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.070 align:start position:0%
regarding eligibility of services that's
extended

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
extended
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
and i want to go try to do some work on
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
this to figure out what what the heck
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
this was
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
and i couldn't follow these citations i
 
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
what we're amending what we're extending
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
i have no clue
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
what's inside of this one
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
i can i can provide some background on
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
that one if you'd like
 
00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.350 align:start position:0%
that one if you'd like
please

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
this relates to access to the state's
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
mental health system
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
and some language was put in place back
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
in 2011
 
00:21:33.679 --> 00:21:36.710 align:start position:0%
in 2011
that

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
restricted access to treatment and other
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
services based on the availability of
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
appropriations and there was some whole
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
language around that that language was
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
originally intended to be repealed on
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
july 1st of 2013
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
and it's for cost-saving reasons it's
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
been extended every biennium since and
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
this would do the same
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
this has become this has achieved a
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
boilerplate status
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
it has by now yes
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
so if we wanted to reduce boilerplate
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
and and put this in some rsa where it
 
00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:15.990 align:start position:0%
and and put this in some rsa where it
belongs

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
belongs
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
do we need different language
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
the rsa is currently in place what you
 
00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:25.039 align:start position:0%
have is a prospective repeal
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
that ends up getting pushed out two
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
so would the hb2 move just be a repeal
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
instead of another
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
the the current language extends the
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
repeal date by two years so if you were
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
to look up this statute online you would
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
see the existing language
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
you would see that that's repealed
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
effective i think july 1st 2021 now
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
and you would see the revised language
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
that's set to replace it all this
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
section does is extend that repeal about
 
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
yet another two years
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm not communicating very well
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
or i'm just confusing myself a little
 
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.190 align:start position:0%
or i'm just confusing myself a little
bit

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.230 align:start position:0%
bit
okay

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
rather than having every budget carry a
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
boilerplate item in it
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
why don't we just
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
do it once
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
and and not have to do this this section
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
every two years oh i see
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
what language would we need to
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
use in section 25
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
to get rid of this issue on a permanent
 
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
basis instead of kicking it down the
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
road two years
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
i think if the committee wanted to do
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
that you would just
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
remove the prospective repeal altogether
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll discuss that but i i'd like
 
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
i'd like to have us make a decision if
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
all right and is are there any other
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
comments on that because i i think
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
section 26
 
00:23:59.919 --> 00:24:01.830 align:start position:0%
section 26
um

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
prospectively repeal regarding the
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
exemption from certain transfer
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
procedures extended
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
so this sounds like green eye shade
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
stuff what what what what are we doing
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
and do
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
do you want to speak right now
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren or do you want
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
mr ripple to explain
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
pardon me i had my hand up um could when
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
we talk about section 25
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
can we please have the department come
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
in and tell us
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
what our actions would mean to them
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am if we're considering another
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
action other than keeping it in house
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
yes and just to be clear what my thought
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
was was this section might be rewritten
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
so that it doesn't come back every two
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
years that we just write it once and
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
or or get the rsa to say what we wanted
 
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
to say i don't know
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
but yes to your question the department
 
00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.789 align:start position:0%
but yes to your question the department
will

00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
will be invited to speak all right thank
 
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.230 align:start position:0%
will be invited to speak all right thank
you

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
yes mr ripple did you want to talk about
 
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.510 align:start position:0%
yes mr ripple did you want to talk about
this

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
section 26 uh sure
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
so that's another prospective repeal in
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
this case it has to do with the
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
department's transfer authority
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
current rsa reads that with respect to
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
all departments no transfer shall be
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
made from any appropriation items for
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
permanent personal services to any other
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
use or purpose
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
and then there are certain restrictions
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
upon that hhs has an exemption from that
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
limitation so with prior approval of the
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee they are currently
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
authorized to move items to move funding
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
out of personnel class lines
 
00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:48.789 align:start position:0%
out of personnel class lines
and

00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:48.799 --> 00:25:49.750 align:start position:0%
and
this

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
section by extending the repeal date
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
will allow them to do that for another
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
year and a half i'm not entirely sure
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
why this is extended until january 1st
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
instead of the end of the biennium
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
but that's something
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
that perhaps the governor's office could
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
most agencies are not allowed to move
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
money from a personnel
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
or employee pay line to somewhere else
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
because many of them were were using
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
that gimmick years ago when somebody
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
would retire they'd spend the money on
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
something else rather than leave it in
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
there which was the design
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
fill up the money for the retirement
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
systems they were going to use the
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
surplus funds so
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
at one point there was a special
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
exemption for hhs
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
and then i guess that
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
we decided that that would be
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
suspended for a while so
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
it was kind of a special deal that was
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
given to hhs but i don't think it's
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate to still have it
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
so your recommendation would be to to to
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
not uh include section 26 again
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
that's right and then it will revert to
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
the common language for all the other
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
all the other uh
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
agencies they can't use personal
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
funds for anything else so so i i assume
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
ms rounds is listening but the next time
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
we talk about this the department can
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
certainly speak in up on
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
what the impact she thinks that would
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
have or whoever she thinks needs to talk
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
i don't want to do it today um
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments on this
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative uh walner or nordgren
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
you've seen this line item for a while
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
no i just think it would be important
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
that the department be able to come up
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
and comment when we could come back to
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
it because i think they have specific
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
reasons why they need these
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
these um footnotes or
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
hb2 sections yes ma'am i think i think
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
i'd also be curious if uh if we've ever
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
had a performance audit to suggest that
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
this authority's been abused or or is
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
just a bad auditing
 
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.470 align:start position:0%
just a bad auditing
practice

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
who who would be able to speak to the
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh if there's anything in an audit
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any audit findings on
 
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
it i can um
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
again i think i'd have to check with the
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
i think you're the kind of a walking
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
encyclopedia sir on on our audits so i
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
i believe the next one is the
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
section 27
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
and what this seems to be adding
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
revenue from the medicaid enhancement
 
00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.590 align:start position:0%
revenue from the medicaid enhancement
tax

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
is going to be used to meet the
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
requirements of rsa 167 64.
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
and and so i put a link to that rsa and
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
and i just am curious do we have any any
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
concerns or issues about that i look to
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
the more senior members of the committee
 
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.590 align:start position:0%
the more senior members of the committee
who

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
um maybe have been following the funding
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
state advantage over the years of three
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:47.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
that medicaid enhancement tax has always
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
been used
 
00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
to help uh cover the
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
bills for the
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh nursing homes
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
but i haven't looked up that that law
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
so so why don't i just say we're gonna
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
have further discussion on that
 
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:06.870 align:start position:0%
have further discussion on that
okay

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
and uh and i think the issue that you're
 
00:30:09.679 --> 00:30:10.630 align:start position:0%
and uh and i think the issue that you're
uh

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that is this diverting
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
money from the nursing
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
care programs
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
and then representative wallner are you
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
recognized when we go back to this one
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
um i think it would be good to have mr
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
lippman here
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
to explain it it i think this
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
gets pretty complicated
 
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.750 align:start position:0%
gets pretty complicated
um

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
so i would want to make sure that um
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
he was here to to give us the
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
correct way of interpreting what this
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
language does
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh i i think i think that's that's wise
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
um what
 
00:30:48.559 --> 00:30:50.149 align:start position:0%
um what
um

00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to think through
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:30:55.039 --> 00:30:56.070 align:start position:0%
the uh
notice

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
notice
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
rules the rules that we have on notice
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
our house calendar
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
i think gives us some flexibility what
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
what i'm thinking of doing is once we
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
get through this
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh schedule scheduling these items on
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
in a sort of an informal way to invite
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
is that does that work mr ripple
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
or do we need to like wait for a formal
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
calendar notice to invite
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
certain members of the department in you
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
you don't need to wait for a formal
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
calendar notice i think the notices that
 
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.909 align:start position:0%
calendar notice i think the notices that
exist

00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
in the calendar going forward that just
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
say work session budget work session or
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
hospital one and two work session are
 
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.549 align:start position:0%
hospital one and two work session are
sufficient

00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
the only thing i would point out is that
 
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.430 align:start position:0%
the only thing i would point out is that
i

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
sorry to go off topic slightly here but
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
i took a look at the calendar for monday
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't explicitly say work
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
session and it doesn't explicitly say
 
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
house bill one and two so i'm emailing
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
the clerk now
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
uh for his opinion on whether he thinks
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
you can talk about house bill 2 on
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
monday from my perspective there's no
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
problem i'm i'm sure the committee's
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
done it before in similar circumstances
 
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
but i i can ask the clerk if you'd like
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
please do i i just
 
00:32:08.799 --> 00:32:10.230 align:start position:0%
please do i i just
i

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
i i certainly don't want to abuse our
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
public notifications i think
 
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's article 38 of our constitution to
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
be continuously transparent to the
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
public and i want to i want to do that
 
00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.710 align:start position:0%
public and i want to i want to do that
so

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
but i i do want us to finish on time
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
just a quick comment on the medicaid
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
enhancement tax i think i was the author
 
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
of it 18 years ago or something like
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
that so what we did was we put up a tax
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
on all the hospitals earnings
 
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
and then we turned around and gave the
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
money back to them
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
and then the feds matched the money we
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
gave to them
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
even though it was theirs originally
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
anyway so
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
and then through the history of it there
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
were some years where we didn't give
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
everything back and they sued us
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
but because of the
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
match that we were using to give them
 
00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.269 align:start position:0%
match that we were using to give them
money

00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
it was medicaid money and if they didn't
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
have enough medicaid patients then they
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
didn't get everything back that we had
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
charged them so it was
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
kind of a controversial thing but it was
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
a dodge to get more medicaid money thank
 
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.389 align:start position:0%
a dodge to get more medicaid money thank
you

00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
i just for the record i i think what you
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
said it was a legal dodge
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
all right um all right so
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
you know because mr lippman is so busy
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
if the department could come back to us
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
and tell us
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
what what which of these work sessions
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
works best for him the the the next
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
the very next one he can make work would
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
be perfect
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
john williams does have his hand raised
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
in the audience he'd like me to bring
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
him in
 
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
oh he did hold on a second
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
i just want to remind people that the
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
goal today is not to solve anything it's
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
just uh i identif you know do a triage
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
to figure out
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
what's what we need to do with these
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
and mr chair uh good afternoon and
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
members of house finance division three
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
this is john williams uh the director of
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs and i just uh wanted
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
to make the committee aware that uh miss
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
rounds uh and myself have coordinated to
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
having uh several department folks
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
available to you today to hopefully be
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
able to answer some of the questions you
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
are raising and i believe currently on
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
this call is director henry lipman so if
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
you do have questions it's certainly as
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
long as you feel uh comfortable that
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
this has been appropriately calendared
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
and we certainly are doing a walkthrough
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
of hb2 right now
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
we could certainly answer many of your
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
questions either
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
after you do your initial walkthrough or
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
coming back through again but we are
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
committed here to be a resource to you
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
and the committee
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate that and um i i i want to
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
accomplish the objective of getting
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
through everything once to get a triage
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
on it because as a committee we've not
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
talked to one another yet about any of
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
these things
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
and so this is the first time that we've
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
had a chance to talk to each other
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
let us if you will let us get through it
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
um so that we we know where all the
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
rocks are and and then we can come back
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
i think um i think we'll come back to
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
that one
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
and i will yellow highlight it
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
since we know that mr lippman is in the
 
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.310 align:start position:0%
since we know that mr lippman is in the
audience

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
um number 28
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
um state treasurer and state accounts
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
and when i looked at this i didn't see
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
an issue but i i wanted to make sure
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
that uh the committee
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
so think about it for a moment raise
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative earth i don't know
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
that i have an issue can kevin explain
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
what it's doing
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
sure i think it simply creates a new
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
dcyf fund that accepts gifts grants and
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
donations but there's no
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation made of general fund
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
dollars or any other or any other
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
dollars in the operating body
 
00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:45.190 align:start position:0%
dollars in the operating body
thanks

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:36:47.359 --> 00:36:48.230 align:start position:0%
all right
so

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
so i i don't i don't
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
see this one as is gonna be hard as
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
being a hard thing
 
00:36:55.359 --> 00:36:56.710 align:start position:0%
being a hard thing
uh

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
so then there's a new section and this
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
section 29.
 
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.589 align:start position:0%
section 29.
um

00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
establishing emergency services
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
fund i guess it's a fund for dcyf and as
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
i read it
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
the questions that came to my mind
 
00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:17.599 align:start position:0%
was it seemed like it was given a lot of
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
flexibility on how to spend state money
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
and and and therefore
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
it made me wonder if we had uh reporting
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
and transparency issues and
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
accountability issues
 
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
so i i i had a question on this
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
that uh i wanted to talk through
 
00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:36.550 align:start position:0%
that uh i wanted to talk through
um

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
to just find out what the sense of the
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee is is this
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
is this appropriately scoped or bounded
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
and are do we have proper
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
separation of duties and and
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
reporting around it
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
or am i just overreacting to it because
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh something new i don't know so so
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
i would like to uh
 
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:00.790 align:start position:0%
i would like to uh
have

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
have you look at it and um
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
i'll uh i'll come back to it when we can
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
schedule it but i'd like to know what
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
people think about
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
the scope is too loose and if we've got
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any comment now before
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
i go to the next section
 
00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:30.470 align:start position:0%
i go to the next section
okay

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
parental reimbursement
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
and so i think my only question is what
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
mr ripple
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
i'm putting you on the spot parental
 
00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.069 align:start position:0%
i'm putting you on the spot parental
reimbursement

00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
and this is one that i think you would
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
want the department to come in and offer
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
an explanation of
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
precisely what it does and why they need
 
00:38:50.800 --> 00:39:01.829 align:start position:0%
precisely what it does and why they need
it

00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any hands up from the
 
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.790 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any hands up from the
committee

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.069 align:start position:0%
and then
okay

00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
so this is another what is the impact of
 
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.109 align:start position:0%
so this is another what is the impact of
this

00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh we're eliminating parental
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement which doesn't sound like
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
anything we want to do but
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
that i don't understand what this
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
program does is what what are we doing
 
00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:31.510 align:start position:0%
program does is what what are we doing
here

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
should we have the department come back
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
you've had some yes
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
at one point if if um
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
your child ended up in
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh chins program or in the dcyf for a
 
00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.069 align:start position:0%
uh chins program or in the dcyf for a
year

00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
it was about a hundred thousand dollars
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
that the parents were supposed to pay
 
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
back even if they had to take a mortgage
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
out on the house the kid was in there
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
for one year that parents might have 20
 
00:39:59.829 --> 00:39:59.839 align:start position:0%
years of payments
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
then we went down to well you only had
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
to pay while the child was there so we
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
decided it was 300 a month you could
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
afford then you'd pay 300 a month while
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
your child was in dcyf
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
and then once they were out you didn't
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
have to pay it now everybody complained
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
about what they were having to pay
 
00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.270 align:start position:0%
about what they were having to pay
so

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
this is probably the
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
reason why we're doing this
 
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
and this subject has been the topic of
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
some bills that have been before the
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
legislature before and i don't recall
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
what the financial impact was i don't
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
think this would have a big impact in
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
revenue if you approve this section but
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
again i would want the department to
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
speak to that right
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
and just just to be clear i i'm probably
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
less concerned about the money than just
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
what's going on with the underlying
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
program when we do this
 
00:40:47.119 --> 00:40:50.630 align:start position:0%
program when we do this
representative

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
i was just going to say that
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
i think we had testimony in the past
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
that the cost of the collections
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
um pretty much canceled out the
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
collection so
 
00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.750 align:start position:0%
collection so
um

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
i i think the department should come and
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
did you want to expand on that
 
00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.270 align:start position:0%
did you want to expand on that
representative

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
i cut you off
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
i was going to say the same thing the
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
cost of collection was probably more
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.109 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
so the next one i think i'm losing my
 
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.870 align:start position:0%
so the next one i think i'm losing my
numbering

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
numbering
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh is the is the next one 31
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
the hhs program eligibility additional
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
revenues is now section 32.
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
so i think the next one we have to talk
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
about i refer to as the weiler rule
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
and this is that they have to come in
 
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:54.710 align:start position:0%
and this is that they have to come in
and

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
if there's they can't just assume a
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
federal eligibility change without
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
telling us and having us formally
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
approve it that's correct and this is
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
language that's been in the past several
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
trailer builds
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
i assume
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
that everyone is okay with this is there
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
anyone who is not okay with with
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:42:19.359 --> 00:42:22.550 align:start position:0%
all right
so

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
so the next one
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
and again i'm messing up my numbers i'm
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
sure i am
 
00:42:28.079 --> 00:42:28.950 align:start position:0%
sure i am
so

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
dhhs excess revenue from federal match
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
programs i read it it sounded reasonable
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
is it reasonable
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
if i could the only comment i would make
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
about this and i see that karen has her
 
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
hand raised in the audience is when you
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
discussed this the last time when we
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
went through house bill 2 briefly i
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
think the governor's office mentioned
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
that they might want to suggest some
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
alternative language
 
00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.870 align:start position:0%
alternative language
oh

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
what what are they going to do there
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
i can follow up though
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
let's uh let ms round speak in case she
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
hi thank you uh yes the um
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
i am working with the governor's office
 
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
on alternative language and i should
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
have that completed this weekend so i
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
that's fantastic
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
because because it's going to get cold
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
again this weekend and you don't want to
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
be outside
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
true story cold and windy
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh do you have anything else to say
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
ms rounds i think i captured it
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
help me get back on my numbering schema
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
mr ripple what is
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
the services for developing
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled what line what
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
section number is that
 
00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
well i think there are some sections in
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
between now
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
i think there's a section
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
that one may have come out entirely
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't see that in the in the
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
trailer bill the next section that i
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
have the section that you just reviewed
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
the excess revenue from federal match
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
programs is 33.
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
and the next is reproductive health
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
i know that there's a proposed language
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
coming to replace what's in 34.
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
um but i've not seen the language
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
and i don't i don't know how big a deal
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
but uh but we're gonna have to uh talk
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
in detail i'm sure
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
so uh unless somebody wants to say
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
something i'm ready to move to the next
 
00:45:11.599 --> 00:45:15.990 align:start position:0%
something i'm ready to move to the next
one

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay so i i i'm thinking it's the
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation for alvarez and and uh
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
martinez martinel
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
anyways the a m study
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
what so what number is that 35
 
00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.190 align:start position:0%
what so what number is that 35
35.

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
35.
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
so when i looked at this i'm i'm just
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
thinking hey
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
i can't put 10 million dollars in there
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
until i see what they're saying and
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
um because they may have said something
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
brilliant or something that nobody
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
really agrees with
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
if we just put the money in there and
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
say we're going to implement their
 
00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.309 align:start position:0%
say we're going to implement their
findings

00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
findings
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
it seems to me like we're giving up our
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
role as a legislator to a contractor and
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
i don't care to do that
 
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.190 align:start position:0%
i don't care to do that
so

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
so i i i have a heavy bias
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
to just stripping but maybe keeping the
 
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
line of the section in there and taking
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
it down to one dollar or something so
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
that you know if uh if the senate wants
 
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
to add it back because they've read the
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
report or the fiscal committee in a year
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know wants to transfer money that
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
there's an account there but but my my
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
bias on this is uh
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
one dollar not 10 million or or even
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
less than a dollar if we if we don't
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
need the language
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
so representative weiler do you have a
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
if you hit the control bar or the space
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
bar you can
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
thanks i don't i don't think it's so
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
much to pay for the study itself it's
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
pretty heavy
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
money to pay for a study but i think
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's to pay for the recommendations as a
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
result of the study
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
yes sir i agree and that's what i'm
 
00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:07.990 align:start position:0%
yes sir i agree and that's what i'm
saying

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars to implement
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations we've not even read
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
just doesn't seem reasonable
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
do you do do you agree or disagree sir
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i need a magnifying glass
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
to read it
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh we did get from karen rounds we did
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
where the where where the funds would go
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
what the funds would do
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
um i agree i would like to see the
 
00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.069 align:start position:0%
um i agree i would like to see the
report

00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
i would like to see what it does but we
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
do have a we do have this breakdown from
 
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.390 align:start position:0%
do have a we do have this breakdown from
her

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
her
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
um which
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
does designate where these funds would
 
00:47:57.359 --> 00:47:58.309 align:start position:0%
does designate where these funds would
go

00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
and i think i i would at least like to
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
next week when um
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
we have the department here i'd like to
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
hear more about this and hopefully the
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to say
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
that we want the department to come back
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
and brief us when the report is
 
00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.910 align:start position:0%
and brief us when the report is
available

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
and and i my position is
 
00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:26.470 align:start position:0%
and and i my position is
that

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
i i'm not i can't approve any money
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
until i've read the report or have had
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
so that's that's just me and we'll end
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
up talking and voting at some point
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
yes i was going to ask mary jane's
 
00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.750 align:start position:0%
yes i was going to ask mary jane's
question

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
but i also
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
am discouraged that we are in this
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
middle of this process and we have yet
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
to see the report so i hope that would
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
be forthcoming pretty quick
 
00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.710 align:start position:0%
be forthcoming pretty quick
thanks

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
yes yes ma'am i i think we share a
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
perspective there and based on what we
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
heard from senator clay wednesday
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon there's a couple of other
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
reports i think we should ask for
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
and ask for all three at once because
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
they they seem to all have the same
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
general impact area and i i i want to
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see the whole picture so

00:49:35.359 --> 00:49:37.190 align:start position:0%
that we want all three reports
sure

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
uh representative walter your hand is
 
00:49:40.559 --> 00:49:41.270 align:start position:0%
uh representative walter your hand is
out

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.230 align:start position:0%
out
oh

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
are we on 36 yet
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're on health and human services
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
suspension of catastrophic aid payments
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
to hospitals
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
is that 36 yes
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
okay well so
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
so why do we want to suspend
 
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
catastrophic aid that why is this a good
 
00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:03.910 align:start position:0%
catastrophic aid that why is this a good
thing

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:04.870 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
i mean i think that uh we don't want i
 
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
mean i wouldn't want to
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't want to
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
take this section out i'd want to retain
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know there's the possibility that at
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
some point
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
we may be able to fund catastrophic aid
 
00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.710 align:start position:0%
we may be able to fund catastrophic aid
so

00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think we want i i i wouldn't
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
want to take this this section out
 
00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm putting in my note that
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
representative wallner wants retain and
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
discussion on it and will right
 
00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.829 align:start position:0%
discussion on it and will right
yes

00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
perfect there any other comments or
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to assume the next one is
 
00:50:49.599 --> 00:50:52.829 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to assume the next one is
37

00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
appropriation dhhs
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
services and sports for mental health
 
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
and social isolation
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
and as i looked at this
 
00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
i had this very strong feeling of
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
why didn't that get put into a bill so
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
that a committee could hold public
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
hearings on it
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
or alternatively
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
it read like something for which we
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
should already have a current program
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
that the money could go against and so
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
why are we using an hb2 section
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
to do something that should either
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
already be flexible in the law
 
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:33.670 align:start position:0%
already be flexible in the law
or

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
should have been a committee bill
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
instead of hb2
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
that that that's my question do any of
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
the representatives want to speak to
 
00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:43.510 align:start position:0%
the representatives want to speak to
that

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
representative irf
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
i'm just guessing based on what matt
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
said to us last time about another
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh item in here that i asked about that
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's a one-time approach they think it's
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
a one-time appropriate one-time
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
appropriation basically
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not not defending i'm just saying i
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
think that's why they put it in here
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay so you think this is the governor's
 
00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.150 align:start position:0%
okay so you think this is the governor's
office

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.030 align:start position:0%
office
and

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh and then it may be a one
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
a one time thing
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
i had the impression that's why they
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
tend to put things into hp2 that's one
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments on this
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative look like you're reaching
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
for your hand raised there
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
i mean i it would be interesting to know
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
who the senior centers are
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
just a little more information about
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
this since it is a
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
and it's a new item
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
i agree that's why i looked at it and
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
went why isn't this a bill that went to
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
a committee there you know some policy
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
committee should be having a social or
 
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
not social excuse me should that be
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
having a public hearing on this i think
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
so i i i don't know the culture around
 
00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:56.630 align:start position:0%
so i i i don't know the culture around
hb2

00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:57.510 align:start position:0%
hb2
um

00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:58.309 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
but i i don't i don't like this one
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
um are there any other comments
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
so if we could mr ripple let the
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
governor's office know
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
matt or if he's if he's online that we'd
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
like to have another pass at this to
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
figure out why this wasn't a bill
 
00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:20.390 align:start position:0%
figure out why this wasn't a bill
okay

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
is the next one appropriations expanded
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
in continued emission discharge and
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
transfer event notifications is that
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
number 38 yes
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
okay so this
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
struck me
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh similarly
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
there i i i we heard
 
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
the department or somebody come in and
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
tell us about how great it was to have
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
these uh adt
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh transfers going out to everyone so
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
that there would be some
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
situational awareness around the patient
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
status that sounded like a good smart
 
00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.069 align:start position:0%
status that sounded like a good smart
thing

00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
why why isn't this program just
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
authorized already
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise it feels like a committee bill
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
to me and and why are we trying to do
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
this in hb2 instead of
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
leveraging an existing program
 
00:54:13.599 --> 00:54:14.630 align:start position:0%
leveraging an existing program
or

00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
sending this to a committee
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
any any of the reps have a comment on
 
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.069 align:start position:0%
any any of the reps have a comment on
that

00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
agree representative
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
uh no
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
i'm fine
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative erf do you
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
have a comment on that i agree with what
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
you said that relates to a few of these
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
okay so similarly
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh mr ripple if we could i assume that
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
this was
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
who did this is this the governor or the
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
department do we know who sourced this
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure who put it in there and i
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
see no hands uh looks like karen has
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
raised her hand
 
00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
all right let's let her speak please
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
hi so this this was put in hb2 because
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
it was realized too late in the
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
governor's budget process that it should
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
have been in hb1 and hv1 had already
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
been completed um so this appropriation
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
i agree should be in hv1 um but they put
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
it in hv2 because it was too late to get
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
it into hp1
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
to hb2 hb1 oh my gosh i'm saying all the
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
wrong words
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
it was too late to get it in the regular
 
00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.430 align:start position:0%
it was too late to get it in the regular
budget

00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
you're speaking my language using the
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
words you just did so so but okay
 
00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:34.710 align:start position:0%
words you just did so so but okay
if

00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
we were to just put it into the budget
 
00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
as part of the division three
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to hb1
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
can we just drop
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
this hb2 section because it really
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
becomes irrelevant yes yes and it would
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
go into the bureau of information
 
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.910 align:start position:0%
go into the bureau of information
services

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
so so you'll you'll help us with a
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
little note on that so that we don't
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
lose it i can do that
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
would you like me to submit a change
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
request for it for hv1
 
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
no that's up to you and uh uh mr ripple
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
whatever mechanics you want to implement
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
there i i
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
you know how to work
 
00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.270 align:start position:0%
you know how to work
okay

00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
kevin i'll get you the information
 
00:56:19.119 --> 00:56:21.349 align:start position:0%
kevin i'll get you the information
okay

00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
just a quick question on that jess is
 
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
this is it intended to be
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
it ongoing to me like it's a good
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
ongoing program if
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
if there's clinical value in letting
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
people know about uh
 
00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.950 align:start position:0%
people know about uh
admissions

00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
admissions
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
discharges and transfers
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
then it's it's probably always a good
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
clinical idea and then
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
then they can start building up their
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
clinical or community
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
referral base
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
announcement that somebody's re-entering
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
the community that's what i think this
 
00:57:01.359 --> 00:57:03.349 align:start position:0%
the community that's what i think this
does

00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
did i say something incorrect there ms
 
00:57:05.839 --> 00:57:08.870 align:start position:0%
did i say something incorrect there ms
rounds

00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
no that i believe that's correct it is
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
intended to be an annual or
 
00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:14.870 align:start position:0%
intended to be an annual or
um

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
a regular expenditure
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
ongoing operations yes
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
so 39
 
00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.030 align:start position:0%
so 39
um

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
i think it's 39
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
this is the 60 bed forensic psychiatric
 
00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.510 align:start position:0%
this is the 60 bed forensic psychiatric
hospital

00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
and my question was
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
should we be
 
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
when we are actively
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
asking ourselves what is the future of
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
the sununu center
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
what it what is what is the right way to
 
00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.789 align:start position:0%
what it what is what is the right way to
handle

00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
handle
 
00:57:48.799 --> 00:57:50.710 align:start position:0%
handle
um

00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
our mentally ill adult and child
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
population and i'm i'm going to go to
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
first because she and i talked last week
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
and and she said this is something that
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
she had some thoughts she wanted to
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
share so
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
so representative walner
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
do you still want to talk
 
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
sure i um
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't i don't really have any
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
great thoughts that i want to share but
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
this was in the last budget also and
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
i believe we
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
did not fund the entire
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
cost but we left in maybe
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
seven to eight million dollars i think
 
00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
um to start the process of doing this
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
but of course because of the pandemic it
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
didn't it didn't get um underway which i
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
can certainly understand
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
i guess some of my questions are this
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
refers to
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
some federal funds that could pay for
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
this and i i'm really curious as to what
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
are those federal funds when will we
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
find out
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
um what are the strings attached to them
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
do we need matching money i mean there's
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
all sorts of questions i have about
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
what are these what federal funds and
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
then it says that if it's not funded
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
with federal funds or any part that
 
00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.589 align:start position:0%
with federal funds or any part that
isn't

00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
00:59:07.599 --> 00:59:08.870 align:start position:0%
isn't
um

00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
it will be bonded the 17.5 million
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
17.25 million dollars will be bonded
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
well that sounds like a capital
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
budget request to me
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering why it isn't
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
in the capital budget request
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
and what does this
 
00:59:28.799 --> 00:59:29.990 align:start position:0%
and what does this
do

00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
to do an offline
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
not in capital budget
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh bonding don't we have a bonding
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
formula that we're trying to
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
the state tries to stay within
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
so i just have a lot of questions about
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
how this how this would
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
really work
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm hearing a whole lot of extra
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
discussion on this one
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
yeah and the the other thing i would
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
like to have the department um
 
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
and maybe corrections i guess because
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a joint project
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
um talk a little bit about is there
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
really a need for 60 beds
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
it seems
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for doing that and
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um i had similar
 
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
questions to mary jane and i just would
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
like to
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
bring up again the whole issue of
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
why this is in the capital budget um
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
there are limits for us
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
set by the treasury about our capital
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
budget and i'm just wondering if that's
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
why this is outside the capital budget
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
but we can get all those answers as we
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
put the package together to ask them
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
representative walter your hand is still
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
up did you have follow-up yeah oh no
 
01:00:59.359 --> 01:01:00.630 align:start position:0%
up did you have follow-up yeah oh no
just

01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
forgot to lower it thank you
 
01:01:06.309 --> 01:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments about this
 
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
ripple you got any thoughts for us to
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
share or or do you think we're kind of
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
on top of this one
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
i have no thoughts except i believe the
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
department has answered some of those
 
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
questions in their
 
01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
their responses but i need to figure out
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
which number that is and uh once i
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
once i find that i'll i'll email it back
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
out to you
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.319 --> 01:01:39.829 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
just to just to point a personal
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
privilege here for a second
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
because i have never gone through this
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
process before i didn't really know what
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
to expect and as a result
 
01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.549 align:start position:0%
to expect and as a result
i

01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
filing system
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
to keep track of questions and the
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
responses that go with them and in the
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
general way in which i i get things is
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
by email
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
which which helps as long as you know i
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
can do searches on the email later but
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
microsoft office isn't a great
 
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
email system for even doing that so i
 
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
know you're putting everything out on
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
the website
 
01:02:23.119 --> 01:02:24.150 align:start position:0%
the website
um

01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:24.789 align:start position:0%
um
i

01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
i just uh it just starts to feel like an
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
easter egg hunt to me with an enormous
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
field in about 20 golden eggs but
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know where to go look so
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
i i'm just letting people know that if
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
i'm breaking down a little bit on
 
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
aggregating data and keeping track of it
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
it's because i'm having
 
01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:48.559 align:start position:0%
trouble so
 
01:02:48.559 --> 01:02:49.510 align:start position:0%
trouble so
um

01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
appearances are what they are they
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
aren't deceiving in this case
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
and i would i would just call your
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
attention again to our website where we
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
have that tracking sheet with committee
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
requests it's getting pretty long but
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
everything on there should be numbered
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
and we're we're
 
01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.119 --> 01:03:13.109 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
all right so are we really on 39 here
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
with uh oh no we were on 39. so this is
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
going this is going to be a major
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
discussion i think
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh so this next one
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
transfer of
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
uh controlled drug prescription from
 
01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
licensure to dhhs and
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
i have to admit when i heard this i went
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
well this is a no-brainer that makes all
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
the sense in the world
 
01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
but then i happened to talk to
 
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire who has
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
been a chair and associated with the
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
licensure area for a number of years
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
and she told me informally that there
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
was an explicit reason they didn't put
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
it in dhhs and
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
and i i forget exactly what she said
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
but she gave me sort of a red flag that
 
01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
this may not be a great idea after all
 
01:04:08.559 --> 01:04:09.589 align:start position:0%
this may not be a great idea after all
and

01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
so i can i can try to get something more
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
formal from her
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
or or the committee members can tell me
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
what they think representative irf
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about 41a oplc
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
controlled drug prescription that seems
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
to be going to d1
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
no i'm talking i'm trying to talk about
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
um what would maybe number section 40
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
transfer of the control drug 40 is
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
military affairs
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
yeah no i think it's uh right after that
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
you got to skip that one yes get that
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
one and skip the next one well the next
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
one is uh new subdivision controlled
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
drug prescription health and safety
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
program that also goes to d1 according
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
to the index
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
it does this this is all now section 41
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
but uh division one has asked that
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
division three take it
 
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.349 align:start position:0%
division three take it
oh

01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:05:01.359 --> 01:05:03.829 align:start position:0%
oh
okay

01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
we're transferring an ongoing operating
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
expense into division three which is if
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
if we accept this
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
but i think there was some operational
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
internal controls reason they wanted to
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
keep it separate
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
and and that's and that's what i think
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
the committee needs to hear unless you
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
guys already know the background on this
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:29.039 --> 01:05:29.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna try to get something more
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
because i think it's important that we
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
double check that we're just not you
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
know one legislature's not talking to
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
another you know
 
01:05:45.039 --> 01:05:46.549 align:start position:0%
another you know
um

01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
all right i know if there's a department
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
representative go ahead well i do think
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
didn't we we did have some discussion
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
i don't even know when
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
but maybe it was maybe i dreamt it i
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
don't know but i think we did have a lot
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
some discussion about this because i
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sure that there was
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
conversation between
 
01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.270 align:start position:0%
conversation between
um

01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
health and human services and the
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
existing light um agency
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
that hope that handles this
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
i thought that they i thought they said
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
that they've been working on this for a
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
while this transfer
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
so you and you and i uh remember pretty
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
much the same thing we did talk about it
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
and i do remember that as i listened
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
it was all passing the common sense to
 
01:06:44.069 --> 01:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
test to me that yeah this probably
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
belongs in dhhs
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
and what i'm what i'm trying to say is
 
01:06:49.119 --> 01:06:50.069 align:start position:0%
and what i'm what i'm trying to say is
that

01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
after we had that uh
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
explanation from the department
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
i found myself talking to
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative carol mcguire who i think
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
and she has kind of an encyclopedic
 
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge of of the history of a lot of
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
these things
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
and she told me that when this
 
01:07:11.839 --> 01:07:13.430 align:start position:0%
and she told me that when this
um

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
drug prescription and health and safety
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
program was being formed
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
there was an explicit decision not to
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
put it into dhhs and i think she said
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
that there was a perception of a
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest of some kind and so
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
they intentionally put it into this
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensing
 
01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.029 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensing
and

01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.190 align:start position:0%
and so
i

01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
i just want
 
01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
us to look before we leap
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
and that we we kind of hear the other
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
side of the the other side of this
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
that that's that's what i'm saying does
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
that make sense representative waller
 
01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:49.750 align:start position:0%
that make sense representative waller
yes

01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sense i just
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
who's going to give the other side
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
well i'm going gonna ask uh
 
01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire to for her advice
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
on on what it would take for us to hear
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
the other side i mean she may just
 
01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
write send us an email or something but
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative erf
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
my inclination me to strip it out and
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
like you said everything else jess why
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
isn't this going through the normal
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
process where public hearings uncover
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
these kinds of issues that you're
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
raising here
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.349 --> 01:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
and just before you move on uh patricia
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
tilly from the department does have her
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you representative
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
edwards i just wanted to note that we
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
will be talking about this in some more
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
detail on monday when we finish the
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
division of public health services
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
walkthrough of our budget and so we can
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
be prepared to provide more detailed
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
information then and we're happy to
 
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
answer any additional questions that you
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
might have
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
at that time or be prepared for thank
 
01:08:58.239 --> 01:08:58.870 align:start position:0%
at that time or be prepared for thank
you

01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
oh thank you um
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
and we intend to have
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
lindsey courtney from the office of
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
professional licensure also joining us
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
in as well so that you can ask her
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
questions at the same time so you can
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
have both of us together
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
okay i see i really appreciate that and
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
and and there's a saying that goes
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
something like there are no solutions
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
there are only trade-offs and i just if
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
if there are disadvantages to moving it
 
01:09:28.269 --> 01:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
i i'd like to know what those
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
disadvantages are even if on the net
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's still worth moving
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you yes
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative your hand is up
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
ma'am oh sorry
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
i just keep forgetting to put it down
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
um okay so at this point we've gone
 
01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.709 align:start position:0%
um okay so at this point we've gone
through

01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:09:52.719 --> 01:09:54.470 align:start position:0%
through
hb2

01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.350 align:start position:0%
hb2
uh

01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
i think completely
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
um the department came with some
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
additional requests and representative
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
pearson sent some ideas
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
but before i
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
come off of this i just want to
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
double check with you mr ripple and
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
listen to representative irf
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
have we done all of the hb2 items that
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
are assigned to dhhs
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
to hhs yes there are five veterans home
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
related items that are assigned to
 
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay so we're not talking about those
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
but we've not heard the veterans home
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
and hearing yet either so that's right
 
01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.270 align:start position:0%
and hearing yet either so that's right
um

01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
if you could ask them to do a twofer is
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
that is that possible to where we when
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about their budget they
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
talk about their hp2 items
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
i have already asked them to talk about
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative if you had your hand
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
i took it down i can't answer my
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
01:10:58.239 --> 01:10:59.189 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
okay

01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:59.199 --> 01:11:00.630 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh the next thing you're going to see
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
if you look at what i emailed you or if
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the shared screen
 
01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.030 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the shared screen
is

01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
you're looking at
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
a cut and paste
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
from mr williams a note to us when he
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
came in and briefed us one day
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
and so i just wanted like i said we we
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
haven't had a conversation with one
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
another as a committee so i wanted to uh
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that today to see how
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
um the first one is a footnote in
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
house bill one
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
and uh representative wallner the other
 
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
day was giving me a little education
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
about when a footnote is appropriate and
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
when an hb2 section
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
is more appropriate and
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for for that
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative wallner and and i would
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
like to ask you mr ripple
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
to just give us a a reminder or a
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
tutorial on
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
what are the uses and limits of a
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
footnote in hb1 and and then therefore
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
well generally speaking the hb1
 
01:12:16.630 --> 01:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
footnotes apply only to the use of money
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
they don't make policy and they also
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
apply only to the biennium in question
 
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
they don't extend beyond that
 
01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
taking a look at the proposed language
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
here my instinct is that it should
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
probably be in house bill 2 instead
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
because it states that the funds shall
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
be continually appropriated and
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing so they would be non-lapsing
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:43.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
and so there are there are two footnotes
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
there one for the system of care and one
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
for the bdas or is your uh observation
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
the same for both i know my observation
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
really only pertained to the bdf bdas
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
example the
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
class 102 shall not lapse until june
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
30th 2023 looks
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.470 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
um are there
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
any comments from the committee because
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
what i what i think i'm about to suggest
 
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
is that the department uh convert
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
um that first footnote
 
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
into proposed hb2 language
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
and that we now carry it as a footnote
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
in hb1
 
01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:33.189 align:start position:0%
in hb1
and

01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
sorry karen does have her hand raised in
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
the audience so perhaps she has a
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
i was just going to suggest that you
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
could add june 30th 2023 to that so that
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
it's actually appropriately a footnote
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
so you'd rather amend the footnote
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
instead of doing an hb2 yes
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
okay just so we don't screw it up would
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
you send us the replacement language
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
exactly how you would have it absolutely
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
and we're back to the idea of two
 
01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:06.310 align:start position:0%
and we're back to the idea of two
footnotes

01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh are there any comments from the
 
01:14:08.159 --> 01:14:12.070 align:start position:0%
uh are there any comments from the
committee

01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.189 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
i think you're trying to get your hand
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
up so you if you no
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
no i'm fine
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
i thought i had started to notice what
 
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
it looks like when you're trying to find
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.390 align:start position:0%
 
replacement

01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.470 align:start position:0%
replacement
language

01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
and then we're gonna go
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay as
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
all right so now we're into uh hb2
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
language again
 
01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:04.870 align:start position:0%
language again
um

01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
i have not spent much time looking at
 
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
these things
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
to be frank
 
01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.310 align:start position:0%
to be frank
is

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
is is there anyone on the committee
 
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
that has put some heavy thought into any
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not seeing any hand shooting up
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
that we've done any heavy thought about
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
these proposals
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
so so go ahead representative
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
where did we get where did these
 
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
proposals come from
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
mr williams and the department came in
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
oh gosh it's probably been two weeks ago
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
maybe two and a half weeks ago and uh
 
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
said that these were some hb2 items that
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
didn't get into the hb2 process but that
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
that the department wanted us to look at
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
it in this period
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
of time and decide to determine if we
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
could put it into our version of hb2 or
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
not so these are i believe are
 
01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.870 align:start position:0%
not so these are i believe are
late-breaking

01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
late-breaking
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
hot topics
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
and i will just comment oh sorry go
 
01:16:12.719 --> 01:16:13.669 align:start position:0%
and i will just comment oh sorry go
ahead

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
no i'm just going to say so when when
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
the department comes back to talk about
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
all these other sections of hb2
 
01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't they
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
spend some time talking about these also
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
and we could make a decision as to
 
01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
did you did you get a chance to say what
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
you wanted to mr ripple
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
i was just going to comment that the
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
first one is boilerplate that's been in
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
place for many years and it was
 
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
inadvertently left out i believe of
 
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 2.
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
so that's why they're proposing it
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
and also they would propose rather than
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
repealing only the indirect graduate
 
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
medical education doing the direct and
 
01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.149 align:start position:0%
medical education doing the direct and
indirect

01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
indirect
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
and actually as i read this now
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
this is another instance where typically
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
it's been a suspension
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
but the proposal here is for repeal
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:09.199 --> 01:17:10.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
so if the department thinks this is easy
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
to deal with by just sending us an email
 
01:17:15.679 --> 01:17:16.630 align:start position:0%
to deal with by just sending us an email
about

01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
this this particular language
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
you you took a deep breath does that is
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
that going to work just ask the
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
department to
 
01:17:30.239 --> 01:17:31.430 align:start position:0%
department to
to

01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
follow up with an email on what they
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
think we ought to do with this yep i
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
think that should be fine
 
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
i just have a process question where do
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
i find the footnotes i know i can see
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
them in your document but
 
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
are they
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
i think that's for you mr ripple
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
where does one find the footnotes so the
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
house bill one footnotes um well i think
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
the proposed footnote isn't currently in
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
there so you wouldn't see that however
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
some accounting units do have
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
class notes or footnotes
 
01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
in the operating budget if you're
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
looking at the pdf version
 
01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.310 align:start position:0%
looking at the pdf version
yeah

01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
that they'll do
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
on any particular page or at the end or
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh just associated with a particular
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
accounting unit at the bottom of that
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
accounting unit you'll see a footnote so
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
they could be anywhere yes tough to pick
 
01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.470 align:start position:0%
they could be anywhere yes tough to pick
out

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
they can be yep okay
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:33.750 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
okay

01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:35.189 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh oh representative weiler please
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
the uh big changes to the 529 program
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
they put in a minute
 
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
but anyway it took uh
 
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
money out of the fidelity
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
payment for the 529 program which is up
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
to almost 18 million we've been usually
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
passing on about 10 or 12. so a lot of
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
that money was grabbed
 
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
for the governor's scholarship plans and
 
01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:01.990 align:start position:0%
for the governor's scholarship plans and
this

01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
particular area might be part of that
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
if you want to look at page 68 and see
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
the changes to the 529 program it it
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
kind of allows some scholarships for
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
medical training
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
and as well as the the
 
01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
restorative medical thing
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
at the milliard
 
01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
so take it took the extra money out of
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
the fidelity and put it in this
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
different commission and this this
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
governor scholarship program so
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
if that's the case a lot of the money
 
01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
that came out of general funds for
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
scholarships which i think this was
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
can come out of that fidelity money
 
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
which is not appropriated
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh do you have a a follow-up
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
to that sir your hand is still up i
 
01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to leave without you
 
01:19:57.199 --> 01:19:58.870 align:start position:0%
don't want to leave without you
finishing

01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
finishing
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
got it
 
01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
represented nordgren
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
oh thank you i think the genesis of this
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
um was the concern for the lack of
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
health care in the north country
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
and i think um the recipients of this
 
01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:18.390 align:start position:0%
and i think um the recipients of this
were

01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
students and
 
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.390 align:start position:0%
students and
uh

01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
care providers who
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
went to the north country in particular
 
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
and then received
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
this aid thanks
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
so kevin is it possible to get a list of
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
all the footnotes because when you look
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
at the spreadsheet obviously you don't
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
see footnotes and i just searched for
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
footnote in the
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
http one and all it went to was the last
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
section of proposed budget sections
 
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
and clearly in these footnotes you could
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
hide all kinds of things i mean height
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
is probably the wrong word you could
 
01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
include all kinds of things
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
yeah they might be called class notes
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
instead um
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
but i can i can get you a list sure
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:04.709 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
so as i look at this i just generally
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
wonder why we're reducing our
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
support for graduate medical education
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
when we have a workforce shortages but
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
there must be a brilliant reason for
 
01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:16.870 align:start position:0%
there must be a brilliant reason for
that

01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh we'll we'll schedule another
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
conversation around this
 
01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:26.830 align:start position:0%
conversation around this
um

01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
i think i think i'm ready to move on to
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
um the comments we got from chairman
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
pearson of hhs
 
01:21:37.199 --> 01:21:38.310 align:start position:0%
pearson of hhs
okay

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:40.950 align:start position:0%
all right so
uh

01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
this is basically an abstract of an
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
email he sent us
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh he he he wants to make sure that we
 
01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
don't cut any benefits going to the area
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
agencies for care of a developmentally
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
delayed population
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
we finally eliminated the wait list
 
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic but the wait list
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
seems possible again
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
seeing the impact
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
a severely dd person has on families i
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
note that while putting dd people on the
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
wait list may save staffing money we
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
also lose in the other direction loved
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
ones who want to work often can't
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
so so this isn't really an hb2 item but
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
because it was coming in over from the
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
policy committee i just wanted everyone
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
to to see that i i think that is meant
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
to reflect
 
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
kind of a summary position or consensus
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
position of the policy committee and not
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
just uh chairman uh pearson's uh
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
personal beliefs
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
so uh representative norgren do you have
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
a comment
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
well um i don't remember getting this
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
email so could you maybe send it out
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
again to all of us
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
okay i okay sure
 
01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.550 align:start position:0%
okay i okay sure
um

01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
you probably don't remember getting it
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
because you probably didn't get it
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:00.310 align:start position:0%
oh okay
thanks

01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
he talked about and this is this is uh
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
around the the the debt the dental care
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
for medicaid program
 
01:23:16.629 --> 01:23:16.639 align:start position:0%
and the summary position was that dental
 
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
dental care is actually a cost-effective
 
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
thing and his argument is essentially
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
that if somebody
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
has severe
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
oral health problems and diseases that
 
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
that infects their entire
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
immune system and just causes them to
 
01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:35.910 align:start position:0%
immune system and just causes them to
get

01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
even sicker
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
causing more emergency room use and and
 
01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
um you know at that point you have to do
 
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
a tooth extraction because it's a
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
medical issue it's covered by medicaid
 
01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:50.629 align:start position:0%
medical issue it's covered by medicaid
so

01:23:50.629 --> 01:23:50.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
so they're
 
01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.350 align:start position:0%
so they're
they're

01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:54.629 align:start position:0%
they're
suggesting

01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
suggesting
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
that they have a bill coming
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
and let me see if they answered the
 
01:23:58.880 --> 01:23:59.990 align:start position:0%
and let me see if they answered the
question

01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
because i've been asking them what they
 
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
did with it in committee
 
01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:07.750 align:start position:0%
did with it in committee
um

01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
oh so they had
 
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
hb 103 that was their dental medicaid
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
program and they
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
amended it and then they retained it and
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
then there's supposed to be another
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill on a similar topic working
 
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
its way over to the house
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
and so this this dental medicaid program
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
actually in law
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
um so so i guess as much as i've been
 
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
trying to mentally reserve money for it
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
in fy 23 we don't have anything to
 
01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:41.750 align:start position:0%
in fy 23 we don't have anything to
to

01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
there is not a program for us to fund at
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
mr ripley
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
is that right
 
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
not actually an existing program there
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
is not a program currently in effect
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
there was language in the prior trailer
 
01:24:58.639 --> 01:24:59.430 align:start position:0%
there was language in the prior trailer
bill

01:24:59.430 --> 01:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
stating that a dental benefit shall be
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
in effect by april 1st of 2021 so that
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
requirement does
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
exist in current law
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
but the program is not up and running
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
so we could reach back to that and fund
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
it if we wanted to with an hb2 with an
 
01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.990 align:start position:0%
it if we wanted to with an hb2 with an
appropriation

01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
is that is that a possibility
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:23.679 --> 01:25:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:26.390 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
not knowing how our hb1 conversations
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
are going to go
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
let's let's see if we can talk about
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
are there
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
any comments about um
 
01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not seeing any
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
um and so uh i want to see if we can
 
01:25:55.679 --> 01:25:56.629 align:start position:0%
um and so uh i want to see if we can
take

01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:25:59.350 --> 01:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
at least one vote to get something off
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
of our plate just to see how this goes
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:06.149 align:start position:0%
um and
uh

01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
i so i want us i want this to be our
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
first vote it's going to have to be a
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
roll call vote
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh i think uh according to you know
 
01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
basic rules i would need
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
a motion in a second
 
01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh i i think that's the procedures we
 
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
use in this committee
 
01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.030 align:start position:0%
use in this committee
um

01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
i would like to see a motion on section
 
01:26:27.679 --> 01:26:29.110 align:start position:0%
i would like to see a motion on section
20.

do you want to speak to your motion
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
no i think it like you say it's
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
boilerplate it's it's been in there a
 
01:27:10.239 --> 01:27:11.110 align:start position:0%
boilerplate it's it's been in there a
while

01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:11.120 align:start position:0%

01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
oh okay very good i'm sorry you can have
 
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
you got it i think i think according the
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
rules you only need to record who makes
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
the motion you don't actually need to
 
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
record the second but
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
but any case
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
um okay is there any further discussion
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
okay if there is no further discussion
 
01:27:54.149 --> 01:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
i would like to

01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:43.590 align:start position:0%
all right
so

01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
um so that was good that was good
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
practice i wanted to understand how we
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
did that
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
and and given that we have
 
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.189 align:start position:0%
and and given that we have
um

01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
under an hour left and that we have mr
 
01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:58.149 align:start position:0%
under an hour left and that we have mr
lippman

01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
lippman
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
on the line waiting
 
01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
why don't we why don't we respect his
 
01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.229 align:start position:0%
why don't we why don't we respect his
time

01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
and ask him to
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
jump in
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
to talk to us about i think i think
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
section 27
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
relative to the new hampshire granite
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
good evening
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon ashley good afternoon mr
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
chairman um are you able to hear me okay
 
01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:27.030 align:start position:0%
chairman um are you able to hear me okay
yes

01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
in 2018 um
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature passed
 
01:29:35.189 --> 01:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
house bill 1817
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
which uh dealt with um
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
the use of uh the met proceeds
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
to fund uh disproportionate share for
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals at that time
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
it was anticipated based on changes in
 
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
federal law that
 
01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:51.350 align:start position:0%
federal law that
um

01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
it that the dish proportion share funds
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
may not be the only
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle in which
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
the funding to hospitals might occur
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
in fact the legislation spoke to
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
the use of directed payments and
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
supplemental payments or rate increases
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
and so what
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
this language is intended to do is to
 
01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.870 align:start position:0%
this language is intended to do is to
permit

01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
permit
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
those funds that would have
 
01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:18.229 align:start position:0%
those funds that would have
paid

01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
paid
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
to hospitals directly as a dish payment
 
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
out of met proceeds since they um
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
going forward starting in 21 to 22 and
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
forward probably won't all be able to be
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
made by dish payments in order to
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
satisfy hb 1817
 
01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:34.719 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
codified with the rsa citation that you
 
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
have and you're right up here
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
to the extent that funds from met which
 
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
were intended to pay dish
 
01:30:46.629 --> 01:30:46.639 align:start position:0%
are needed instead to pay either a
 
01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
directed payment or
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
a supplemental payment or whatever under
 
01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
um the granted advantage program that
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
that that portion of the met proceeds
 
01:30:58.149 --> 01:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
could be used to do so so basically it's
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
a zero-sum game in the sense that um
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
a certain percentage of the
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
collected tax is intended to to fund
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
hospital um
 
01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
payments uh and the balance of it is
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
used to fund other parts of
 
01:31:14.229 --> 01:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
dhhs and so this isn't really
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
creating a new uh thing it's just the
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
fact that the
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
there's a different type of payment that
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
has to be made and
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
and and uh met would be otherwise have
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
been the source of that payment
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
negatively in effect revenues to nursing
 
01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:32.950 align:start position:0%
negatively in effect revenues to nursing
care

01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:34.310 align:start position:0%
care
programs

01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
this this particular tax is uh solely
 
01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:38.709 align:start position:0%
this this particular tax is uh solely
for

01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
the hospitals sector and then provider
 
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
payments none of which are related to
 
01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities
 
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative you have a question
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
so mr lippman this gives us the
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility that we didn't have with the
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
original met
 
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
which is why we got sued i don't know 10
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
15 years ago because we uh charge it to
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
the hospital in accordance with what
 
01:32:06.149 --> 01:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
they build and all their and all their
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
bills and then we tried to give it back
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
to them but some of them hadn't had
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
enough medicaid
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
payments that uh we couldn't justify it
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
the feds wouldn't allow us to give the
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
whole mob back so
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
we had to work out something and so
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully this is what that workout is
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
all these many years later and it uh
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
gave us some lawsuits perhaps so i i
 
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
think this is a good idea and i favor it
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor of the original met many
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
years ago thank you
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
questions i i'd i'd be willing to
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion that the committee
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
before you continue could i just make
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
one comment which is that you don't
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
actually have to take affirmative votes
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
on every item that you want to leave in
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to you could just take a
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
vote on the items that you want to amend
 
01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:11.430 align:start position:0%
vote on the items that you want to amend
um

01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the way division three has
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
done it in previous years that said
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
there's there's certainly nothing wrong
 
01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
with voting on each item if that's the
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
way you want to go about
 
01:33:24.149 --> 01:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
it we get to the same place which way
 
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
gets there fastest without um
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
missing anything
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
just tell kevin you want to put it in
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
that i'm just i'm just looking i'm just
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure though that i don't
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
say leave it in when there's uh
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
opposition and the opposition's not been
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
able to be heard publicly
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's fine and this is a perfectly
 
01:33:50.229 --> 01:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
valid way to go about it i just want to
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
let you know that you don't have to be
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
i just don't want to
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
have a process that
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
runs over
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
opposing points of view
 
01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:07.350 align:start position:0%
opposing points of view
okay

01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:08.149 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:08.159 --> 01:34:08.950 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay can can i get a
 
01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:14.560 align:start position:0%

01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%

representative rogers
yes

01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
yes

representative edwards
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
four to seven to zero
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you and and i realized
 
01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
once the voting started that i didn't
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
offer an opportunity to discuss it so
 
01:35:40.709 --> 01:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
um but i since we all voted yes i
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
apparently there wasn't any discussion
 
01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:45.510 align:start position:0%
apparently there wasn't any discussion
uh

01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:48.550 align:start position:0%
uh
okay

01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
that will probably be our last vote of
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
the day because i want to talk to folks
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
about the smartest way to proceed on on
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
getting these approved my goal
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
is to be efficient and effective but i
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
have anyone's voice um not heard
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
so if somebody wants to talk to me about
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
that later we'll come up with another uh
 
01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:14.070 align:start position:0%
that later we'll come up with another uh
idea

01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
so so mr
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
is if mr lipman is still there i am sir
 
01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:21.350 align:start position:0%
is if mr lipman is still there i am sir
um

01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
i my notes were not all that great where
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
i can search on your name and find the
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
places that you were able to talk to
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
do you do you recall any of these that
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
you thought that you would like to speak
 
01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:35.669 align:start position:0%
you thought that you would like to speak
to

01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
yes i think there were two and
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to remember which numbers
 
01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
they are see i've got my cliff notes
 
01:36:42.970 --> 01:36:42.980 align:start position:0%
here um
 
01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:44.709 align:start position:0%
here um
[Music]

01:36:44.709 --> 01:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
i think the suspension of catastrophic
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
aid was one of them
 
01:36:49.199 --> 01:36:50.310 align:start position:0%
aid was one of them
um

01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:00.629 --> 01:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
let's do that and then maybe mr williams
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
can figure out the second one while
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
so i think uh as representative walner
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
had uh
 
01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:10.470 align:start position:0%
had uh
uh

01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
spoken to earlier i think it's actually
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
dme and ime is the other one and they
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
both fit into the same category i think
 
01:37:16.719 --> 01:37:18.709 align:start position:0%
both fit into the same category i think
um

01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
it's been the case that as
 
01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
as you know as a committee you have a
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
challenge um
 
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
meeting the the budget targets you need
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
to make and i think in these couple of
 
01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
areas um
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
it's been uh historically carried hb 2
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
for a number of different bienniums
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
that rather than
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
ending these things
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
if there's an opportunity to fund them
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
that in the future that
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
that they've left them in the posture
 
01:37:47.590 --> 01:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
similar to the one that was
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
included i think it was an oversight and
 
01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:52.310 align:start position:0%
included i think it was an oversight and
hp

01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
hb2 drafting
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
to not include um
 
01:37:56.639 --> 01:38:00.310 align:start position:0%
to not include um
the

01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
the one that was not included in there
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
mr williams can
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
jump in here for a minute i think it was
 
01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:08.229 align:start position:0%
jump in here for a minute i think it was
the

01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:10.709 --> 01:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
suspension of catastrophic aid is in
 
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
here and is i think needed to just as a
 
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
placeholder the ime and dme
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
excuse me i indirect medical education
 
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
and direct medical education are
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
also that category that they're just not
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
able to be funded at this point and i
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
think in terms of the provider community
 
01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
understands that
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
and in relationship to
 
01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
you know your earlier vote on number 27
 
01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's part of the whole
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
okay you know representative you you
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
retain this and discuss it further do
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
you um well
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
no i just wanted to hear what mr lipman
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
had to say
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
and i think he has just talked on this
 
01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:52.790 align:start position:0%
and i think he has just talked on this
one

01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:53.750 align:start position:0%
one
um

01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.270 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
i mean i feel i feel like it makes sense
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren do you have
 
01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:04.950 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren do you have
questions

01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
01:39:08.149 --> 01:39:08.159 align:start position:0%
i guess the question is
 
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
do we want the word suspend
 
01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.590 align:start position:0%
do we want the word suspend
um

01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
rather than just not funding it for this
 
01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:19.510 align:start position:0%
rather than just not funding it for this
year

01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative i think the reason
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
suspension is used so that we can
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't have to take it out of the state
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
plan and then some future time
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
go through the process of putting it in
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
it's i think a simpler way to give the
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
state the flexibility um
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative your hand is still
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
up to you no
 
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
no i think it makes sense i mean
 
01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
i would hate to have to see you change
 
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
the state plan and then have to change
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
it back again
 
01:39:58.950 --> 01:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
if something happened so to me it makes
 
01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:00.070 align:start position:0%
if something happened so to me it makes
sense

01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
you want to make a motion on section 36
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
relative to catastrophic aid payments to
 
01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:06.709 align:start position:0%
relative to catastrophic aid payments to
hospitals

01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
sure i will make a motion that we
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh leave this section in
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
here in a second i don't know if we need
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
second

01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.510 align:start position:0%
second
okay

01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
so uh mr clerk would you call a roll
 
01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
the motion being
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh the uh division three uh is voting to
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
accept section 36
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
relative to suspension of catastrophic
 
01:40:50.400 --> 01:41:03.669 align:start position:0%
relative to suspension of catastrophic
aid

01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
we payments a motion in a second is that
 
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
correct yes sir i think we're i think
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're ready for a roll call
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
all right representative earth
 
01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:13.590 align:start position:0%
all right representative earth
yes

01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative weiler votes yes
 
01:41:16.830 --> 01:41:16.840 align:start position:0%

yes
representative

01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:24.629 align:start position:0%
representative
yes

01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative rogers yes
 
01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
01:41:29.119 --> 01:41:30.790 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
yes

01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
mr chairman of the voter 7-0
 
01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:35.590 align:start position:0%
mr chairman of the voter 7-0
okay

01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:37.669 align:start position:0%
all right
so

01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
um mr lippman uh while we've been
 
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
talking uh did mr williams tell you the
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
other one that we want to talk about
 
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
graduate medical education and direct it
 
01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
was uh yes i remember i remembered it
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
here um because i think that that was
 
01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:54.390 align:start position:0%
here um because i think that that was
um

01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
if you will have been carried in other
 
01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
hb2s and we would like to be continued
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
to be carried in this one i think it was
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
an oversight that it got um
 
01:42:08.709 --> 01:42:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay so this one's a little bit
 
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
different because these are these are
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
brand new notes they're not in hb2
 
01:42:16.159 --> 01:42:17.669 align:start position:0%
brand new notes they're not in hb2
currently

01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
so mr ripple what would be the process
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
if the commit or well first
 
01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
as you're reading these do you think
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
these are sufficient for us to put into
 
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
hb2 this this first one looks more
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
cooked than the second
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
portion of it i don't see any language
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
i think sorry i think the graduate
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
medical education payments piece is okay
 
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
except you would want to say direct as
 
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
well as indirect and we could have we
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
would have this drafted uh as a house
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
bill 2 amendment from ols anyway so you
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
would get a formal amendment to vote on
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
i guess the only other thing again that
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
i would point out is that as written
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
this is a repeal rather than a
 
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
suspension as has been in previous
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
so it's actually possible that the
 
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
department may want to take just a quick
 
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
second look at this to get it the way
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
they want it is that possible
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
40 minutes still
 
01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:34.070 align:start position:0%
40 minutes still
um

01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
maybe we could try an alternative way of
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
there was uh an issue here on the foster
 
01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
grandparent program
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
and we were going to
 
01:43:57.669 --> 01:43:57.679 align:start position:0%
leave this open
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
are there questions that you have for
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
the department that would help you
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
figure out if you want this to be
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
um i would i mean i would suspend
 
01:44:15.669 --> 01:44:15.679 align:start position:0%
the program and not repeal it
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
um i think it's
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
a program that we've gone back and forth
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.430 align:start position:0%
over the years
um

01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
we haven't even finished house bill one
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
yet and
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
lo and behold
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
we find a pot of gold it might be
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
something we would want to
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
to include um this is a really fun
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
especially the foster grandparent
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
program is
 
01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:41.830 align:start position:0%
program is
really

01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:42.629 align:start position:0%
really
a

01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
fantastic program for
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
elderly people who
 
01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
still have the energy and want to work
 
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
with kids
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
they work in schools they work in child
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
care centers um
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
and they get paid a very small stipend
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
and the income eligibility to be a
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
foster grandparent is so low but it does
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
help them and it's it's absolutely
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
fantastic for the kids
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
because they get to spend time with an
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
older adult
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
and um so i would just like to see us at
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
least leave it on suspension and not
 
01:45:14.159 --> 01:45:17.270 align:start position:0%
least leave it on suspension and not
repeal

01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:18.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
are there any committee members that
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
politely disagree with representative
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
waller that they want to keep this a
 
01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:26.390 align:start position:0%
waller that they want to keep this a
repeal

01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:27.430 align:start position:0%
repeal
or

01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:28.229 align:start position:0%
or
or

01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:45:31.030 --> 01:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
or do we agree that a suspension is a
 
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
better way to go or or do we just
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
want to strike this from hb2
 
01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
it's kind of the floor is open
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative irv could somebody give
 
01:45:41.590 --> 01:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
me the correct number so i can actually
 
01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
get to and read it
 
01:45:46.470 --> 01:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
well i thought it was section 22 but
 
01:45:49.590 --> 01:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
there's two okay
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:45:52.709 --> 01:45:52.719 align:start position:0%
if it's not
 
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
let us know the correct number it's it's
 
01:45:58.229 --> 01:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
21 22 or 23 it's in that neighborhood 22
 
01:45:59.669 --> 01:45:59.679 align:start position:0%
seems to be senior volunteer grant
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
program is that the grandparents thing
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's 22 and i think it covers everything
 
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
it covers congregate services and the
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
senior volunteer grant program
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
and that but that's referencing the
 
01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:11.910 align:start position:0%
and that but that's referencing the
grandparents

01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
grandparents
 
01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:13.350 align:start position:0%
grandparents
yes

01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:14.149 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
okay and the senior volunteer is that a
 
01:46:18.149 --> 01:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
similar kind of thing
 
01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
yeah the other one you mentioned
 
01:46:23.590 --> 01:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
i believe one was included in the
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
broader program so i'd have to take a
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
i have to take a look at how it's
 
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
written but i think the foster
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
grandparent program is part of the
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
senior volunteer grant program
 
01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
okay and i guess i'm ready to go just i
 
01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
just i wasn't really prepared for this
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm the first one to vote
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
yeah no it doesn't sound like uh it
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
sounds like mr ripple wants to just look
 
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
into it a little bit more before we take
 
01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
it off the plate
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
not that i'm not supportive i'd just
 
01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
like to know the general sense of the
 
01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:54.870 align:start position:0%
like to know the general sense of the
committee

01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
so so let's do a general sense of the
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
committee are we
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
do we do we think representative wallner
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
is right when she says this should be a
 
01:47:07.109 --> 01:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
yes that was the motion i was going to
 
01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:14.950 align:start position:0%
yes that was the motion i was going to
make

01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
so so because this is not ready to vote
 
01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:18.950 align:start position:0%
so so because this is not ready to vote
um

01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
and mr ripple is is just going to double
 
01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
check uh check it a little bit
 
01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:26.629 align:start position:0%
check uh check it a little bit
um

01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
let's let's just leave the suspend item
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
open and and talk about it next week
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative walter your hand is still
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
up did you have further comment
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
nope nope
 
01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
and so that
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
so 2023
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
got rolled into 22 so so that would
 
01:47:54.550 --> 01:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
that's all one section all right
 
01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:55.990 align:start position:0%
that's all one section all right
um

01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay mr williams if you're still there
 
01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:01.109 align:start position:0%
okay mr williams if you're still there
um

01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
you were going to tell us some more
 
01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:04.390 align:start position:0%
you were going to tell us some more
about

01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
the section 23 department of hhs social
 
01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
services block grant
 
01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:12.229 align:start position:0%
services block grant
adjustment

01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
adjustment
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
and and mr chair thank you very much
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
and so before addressing i just wanted
 
01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
to to let you know mr chair that we did
 
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
line up uh for today to support the
 
01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
division three as well as mr ripple uh
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
with subject matter experts on various
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
sections on this bill including as
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
you've heard from mr lipman so if you
 
01:48:35.109 --> 01:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
have some additional time and want to
 
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
utilize those folks who have uh uh spent
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
the time to monitor this to be
 
01:48:43.109 --> 01:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
questions but otherwise certainly will
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
defer to you if you would like us to do
 
01:48:48.149 --> 01:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
this at a later time as well but we do
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
have folks out here who could help with
 
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps additional
 
01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.590 align:start position:0%
perhaps additional
sections

01:48:55.590 --> 01:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
so so did you not hear me ask you to
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
talk about section 23.
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
yes you did thank you very much so
 
01:49:05.590 --> 01:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
section 23 uh deals with the social
 
01:49:07.590 --> 01:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
services block grant and if i could have
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
included in the conversation uh wendy
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
director wendy altman because she can
 
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
certainly provide some additional
 
01:49:17.189 --> 01:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
background uh regarding this but as
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
we're bringing her in i can give you a
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
very high level of what we're looking to
 
01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:21.669 align:start position:0%
very high level of what we're looking to
do

01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
as you probably are aware that this has
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
been an item that's been in the budget
 
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
for well over a decade as long as i've
 
01:49:31.030 --> 01:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
been doing my work legislatively and
 
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
it's a requirement that we make certain
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
adjustments based upon a cost of living
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
based upon the social security uh
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
benefits that are out there
 
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
as you'll know this is a very modest
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
increase that is required under federal
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
law and we're required to having this
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
provision within the context of hb2 and
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's been in the budget for like i
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned over a decade and at least by
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
information from social security uh for
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
the 70 million americans who do
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
currently receive this cost living
 
01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:03.350 align:start position:0%
currently receive this cost living
increase

01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
in 2021 that increase is a
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
1.3 so we're talking about a very very
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
small sum of money however it's
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
important uh obviously to have included
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
as part of the budget
 
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
so other than the language that is
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
boiler language that's already contained
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2 as introduced in section
 
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
23 found on page 10 line 10
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
we were also looking to have some
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
additional language uh included within
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
it to create greater efficiencies not
 
01:50:35.990 --> 01:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
only for the executive branch the
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
department but also for the legislature
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
by way of background last
 
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
biennium in hb4 which was the trailer
 
01:50:47.669 --> 01:50:47.679 align:start position:0%
built to the budget in 2019
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
we actually
 
01:50:51.669 --> 01:50:51.679 align:start position:0%
thought up an idea that was a very good
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
one working along with the legislature
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
working along with the governor's office
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
that um there was a provision that it
 
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
related to long-term care that we were
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
required to going before the joint uh
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
committee on administrative rules uh
 
01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
every uh every budget session even
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
though the changes that were being made
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
were static in nature so was it it was
 
01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
deemed to be an unnecessary process for
 
01:51:16.709 --> 01:51:16.719 align:start position:0%
us to have to go
 
01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
in addition to the language within um
 
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
the the budget we also had to go to the
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
joint administrative uh committee on
 
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
administrative rules could i interrupt
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
you a second are you still talking about
 
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
section 23 it feels like
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
yes yes all right keep going
 
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
so what we're suggesting and it was part
 
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
of the uh language that was provided by
 
01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
mr ripple and it was part of our
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
discussions on the additional add-on and
 
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
i'm just going i can certainly stop if
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
you want us to stay in the context of
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
section 23 we can but there was an
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
additional request by the department to
 
01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:54.950 align:start position:0%
additional request by the department to
consider

01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
language so that the department once we
 
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
make these particular adjustments uh to
 
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
the social services block grant based
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
upon the cost of living adjustments
 
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
that the current law that requires us to
 
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
also go to the joint committee on
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that we could get a
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
carve out for not having to do that as
 
01:52:15.589 --> 01:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
long as we provide the public with
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate notification and that's what
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
we're seeking to do with the additional
 
01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:20.229 align:start position:0%
we're seeking to do with the additional
language

01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay so so i'm i'm a simple guy what i
 
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
think i just heard you say
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
is that you like what's in section 23
 
01:52:30.149 --> 01:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
but doesn't include as much as you'd
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
like so you've sent in a
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
an alternative section 23 that you'd
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
like us to review
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
and that addition
 
01:52:42.629 --> 01:52:42.639 align:start position:0%
is would change your reporting
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
requirements over to
 
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
a different part of the house
 
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
um essentially that's very close i have
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
to make one distinction because the
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
amendment because section 23 is based
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
upon chapter law and not embedded in a
 
01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:01.109 align:start position:0%
upon chapter law and not embedded in a
rsa

01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
we're looking actually to in addition to
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
section 23 to adding an additional
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
section to hb2 that is directly directly
 
01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
related to the same section around the
 
01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
social services block grant
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
to include an amendment under rsa 541
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
dash a colon 21 roman uh 3a
 
01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
to uh to essentially amend
 
01:53:26.709 --> 01:53:26.719 align:start position:0%
the current requirement under the
 
01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
administrative uh procedures act in new
 
01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire to
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
allow a carve out to the department does
 
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
not have to also go to the joint
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
committee on administrative roles
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
every time to making these these
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
adjustments which are uh
 
01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
i kind of heard that i'm just i'm just
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
looking for steps and so
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
the step that i i'm curious about is
 
01:53:52.629 --> 01:53:52.639 align:start position:0%
is that language drafted and it is is it
 
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
in the possession of the lba it is
 
01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
granted and is in the possession of mr
 
01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:58.790 align:start position:0%
granted and is in the possession of mr
ripple

01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
ripple
 
01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not on the list of things
 
01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
that we were prepared to talk about
 
01:54:03.199 --> 01:54:04.070 align:start position:0%
that we were prepared to talk about
today

01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
but uh mr chair it was provided on the
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
initial discussions that we had had uh
 
01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
relative it's in that same document that
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
has the hb1 footnote language as well as
 
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
language that mr lipman talked about for
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
inclusion as it related to the direct
 
01:54:22.149 --> 01:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
and indirect uh graduate medical
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
expenses so i thought it just made sense
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
where this language was also included in
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
that same document that for some
 
01:54:30.629 --> 01:54:30.639 align:start position:0%
efficiency that we presented
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
at this stage
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay well so maybe i'm the one that uh
 
01:54:36.550 --> 01:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
overlooked it um
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
but uh but we're not prepared to to look
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
at your language today so we're gonna
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
have to schedule it uh in the future
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's kind of the bottom line
 
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
everything you're saying is sounding
 
01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable it's just we're not
 
01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
you know from a stepwise perspective
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
we're just not ready to
 
01:54:55.109 --> 01:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
to look at it as a committee and talk
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:54:59.430 --> 01:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh if if you wouldn't mind just sending
 
01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're talking about again
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
with a clear title uh i'm i'm not likely
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:12.149 --> 01:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
representative do you have a question
 
01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm wondering how
 
01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
much money is in this is it general
 
01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
funds or
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
federal funds and what's the
 
01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
amount of the increase
 
01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:28.719 align:start position:0%
thank you and mr chair uh to to respond
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
to representative wyler's question i
 
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
would defer either to miss rounds or to
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
miss altman they'll be able to explain
 
01:55:37.589 --> 01:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
uh what the mix is in terms of the
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
federal and the state match and where
 
01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's located within the budget
 
01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:46.470 align:start position:0%
it's located within the budget
okay

01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
i don't have that information off hand
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:53.189 align:start position:0%
 
hi

01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
hi
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh this is wendy altman i'm the bureau
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
chief of the bureau of elderly adult
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
services so one of the questions was
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
what the polar or what the income limit
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
is um as of this year and that's um 1
 
01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
314 dollars and 30 cents for an
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
individual that's the eligibility
 
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
income and it is a
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
combination of federal
 
01:56:20.070 --> 01:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
social service block grant title 20
 
01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0%
funding and general funds but i i don't
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
have in front of me the
 
01:56:26.310 --> 01:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
the percent mix
 
01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:27.109 align:start position:0%
the percent mix
okay

01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
so so it's it sounds like we do have
 
01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
multiple reasons for deferring the
 
01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
conversation away from
 
01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:35.030 align:start position:0%
conversation away from
now

01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:56:37.109 --> 01:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
so we'll
 
01:56:37.119 --> 01:56:38.149 align:start position:0%
so we'll
uh

01:56:38.149 --> 01:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll come up with uh
 
01:56:42.070 --> 01:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
when we plan to talk about these again
 
01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
and you'll have time to get your your
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
notes together are there are there any
 
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
other questions uh representing weiler
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
that was a great question are there any
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
other questions we want to bring back
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
into this representative irf
 
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
could i ask but
 
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
if we're going to look at this again we
 
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
get all this information ahead of time
 
01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
that relates to these so we have time to
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
actually review it i understand uh mr
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
williams said we did get a document
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
before and i don't doubt that
 
01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
um but i didn't relate it to this today
 
01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:11.189 align:start position:0%
um but i didn't relate it to this today
unfortunately

01:57:11.189 --> 01:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:57:12.790 --> 01:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
and and mr chairman responding to
 
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
represent earth's uh um uh ask of the
 
01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
department so in preparation for for
 
01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
today and perhaps it was my
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of the the overall
 
01:57:25.109 --> 01:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
purpose is that not knowing all the
 
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
questions that could arise here is the
 
01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
reason why uh that i coordinated working
 
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
with miss rounds to having around 10 to
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
15 subject matter experts including
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
directors with our department available
 
01:57:38.709 --> 01:57:38.719 align:start position:0%
to you to respond to your questions so
 
01:57:40.709 --> 01:57:40.719 align:start position:0%
as the questions arise that we're not
 
01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
able to actually answer your questions
 
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
we certainly will work diligently to get
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
you further detailed information point
 
01:57:50.070 --> 01:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
in case the example from uh director
 
01:57:53.109 --> 01:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
altman around the federal state uh
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
matching proportions and getting back to
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
you on that but absent knowing
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
specifically what your questions are
 
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
makes it a little bit difficult
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
for for us to kind of figure those out
 
01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
in a vacuum but we are prepared to at
 
01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
least explain you know what the language
 
01:58:10.070 --> 01:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
does to give you a very transparent
 
01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:11.030 align:start position:0%
does to give you a very transparent
picture

01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
picture
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
of why they are included within the
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
budget and we were prepared today to do
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
that on many of these items but again i
 
01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
would defer to the chair because i
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
believe it was my misunderstanding of
 
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
the depth of which uh the division three
 
01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
was going to
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
go into these particular sections today
 
01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:30.470 align:start position:0%
go into these particular sections today
okay

01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't possibly know mr williams
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
because we didn't talk about it
 
01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
but today is sort of a day of
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
celebration for me because this is
 
01:58:40.950 --> 01:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
actually the first time that the
 
01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
committee has been able to interactively
 
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
talk to each other to level set what
 
01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
we're thinking about hb2
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
and because we are prevented under
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
rsa 98 or 91a
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
to to have sidebar meetings to work all
 
01:58:59.589 --> 01:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
this stuff out in advance we have to
 
01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
have these conversations in public so
 
01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:03.679 align:start position:0%
that we are transparent
 
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
and and that's and that's really what
 
01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of today was is to have the
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
first two and a half hour discussion to
 
01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
see the extent to which we are
 
01:59:17.109 --> 01:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
aligned or we are going to have issues
 
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
and and as a result of talking about it
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's natural that questions that nobody
 
01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:23.910 align:start position:0%
it's natural that questions that nobody
anticipated

01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
anticipated
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
comes up because this is really the
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
first time we've had an opportunity to
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
speak to one another and effectively end
 
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
up brainstorming where one person's
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
comment may trigger another thought in
 
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
another person it's i think that
 
01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
brainstorming is just a natural part of
 
01:59:42.149 --> 01:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
of teamwork and i'm sorry
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
if uh if it's caused a lot of members of
 
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
dhhs to spend their friday afternoon
 
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
with us listening to us talking to one
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
another but but that's the stage that we
 
01:59:54.950 --> 01:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
were in today
 
01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:56.390 align:start position:0%
were in today
um

01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:58.629 --> 01:59:58.639 align:start position:0%
representative erf
 
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could take advantage of
 
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
all the folks being here to
 
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
go through the items and ask questions
 
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
without the specific intent to then
 
02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
process them today
 
02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
that is exactly what i was trying to do
 
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
but for the third time i heard how
 
02:00:14.709 --> 02:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
everyone was brought here today to talk
 
02:00:14.719 --> 02:00:15.669 align:start position:0%
everyone was brought here today to talk
about

02:00:15.669 --> 02:00:15.679 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:00:17.270 --> 02:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
things so
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:23.669 --> 02:00:23.679 align:start position:0%
are there any other areas that we've
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
brought up that the department would
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
like to speak up on that we've asked
 
02:00:31.030 --> 02:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
questions i've been taking notes and
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
trying to run the meeting and
 
02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
am not
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
ready to go directly
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
to where we've talked before and we've
 
02:00:43.830 --> 02:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:46.149 --> 02:00:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative edwards this is wendy
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
altman from the bureau of elderly and
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
adult services
 
02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
i'd like to
 
02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
just have a moment to be able to answer
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
one of the previous questions about
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
the foster grandparent program in the
 
02:01:00.629 --> 02:01:00.639 align:start position:0%
congregate meals program
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
i know that representative walner
 
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
had mentioned that it's been suspended
 
02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:06.950 align:start position:0%
had mentioned that it's been suspended
for

02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
before um but we do know that it's been
 
02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh over 10 years um that these programs
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
have been suspended um and they just
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
every time the biennium comes up they
 
02:01:24.070 --> 02:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
they get resuspended again um and
 
02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
specifically with the congregate housing
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
program this was something where we
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
attributed general funds to the program
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
but it did not pay
 
02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
solely a hundred percent for the program
 
02:01:39.109 --> 02:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
there were federal dollars that um
 
02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
primarily contributed to the congregate
 
02:01:44.229 --> 02:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
housing um becoming operational and that
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
federal funding is not no longer
 
02:01:49.510 --> 02:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
available um so attributing general
 
02:01:51.510 --> 02:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
funds to the program may
 
02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:52.470 align:start position:0%
funds to the program may
um

02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily implement or
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
operationalize a program um so
 
02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
in the past when we've re-established
 
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
these um and brought it forward one of
 
02:02:07.030 --> 02:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
the issues um was that hud funds weren't
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
being contributed it to any longer um so
 
02:02:13.030 --> 02:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's why we put it forward to be
 
02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:15.990 align:start position:0%
that's why we put it forward to be
repealed

02:02:15.990 --> 02:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for that is so your bottom
 
02:02:21.030 --> 02:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
line is you think a a repeal is the
 
02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:23.679 align:start position:0%
right way to go and not a suspension
 
02:02:23.679 --> 02:02:24.870 align:start position:0%
right way to go and not a suspension
correct

02:02:24.870 --> 02:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:02:26.470 --> 02:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
and mr church
 
02:02:27.669 --> 02:02:27.679 align:start position:0%
if i president
 
02:02:32.950 --> 02:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
you're on mute i i think your mouths are
 
02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
saying no
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay sorry about that um
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
i just was trying to check
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
house bill one i thought that we had
 
02:02:47.669 --> 02:02:47.679 align:start position:0%
i thought we had had some funding for
 
02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
foster grandparent program
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
in the last biennium
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
but i i certainly could be wrong
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
sorry no uh if i could interject yes
 
02:03:00.629 --> 02:03:00.639 align:start position:0%
they were both congregate housing and
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
foster grandparents were both funded in
 
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
the 2021 budget
 
02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
congregate housing at 750 000 per year
 
02:03:08.550 --> 02:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
of general funds and foster grandparent
 
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
at 100 000 per year general funds
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
great thank you i thought that they were
 
02:03:16.149 --> 02:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
both funded in the last um in the last
 
02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
budget thank you
 
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
great memory uh so so ms aldman did did
 
02:03:23.350 --> 02:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
i mishear you it sounded like there
 
02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
hadn't been funding and that's why you
 
02:03:25.199 --> 02:03:26.070 align:start position:0%
hadn't been funding and that's why you
think

02:03:26.070 --> 02:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
a repeal is appropriate do you still
 
02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
think that
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
yes i think that in in the past um
 
02:03:33.119 --> 02:03:34.390 align:start position:0%
yes i think that in in the past um
advocates

02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
advocates
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
especially in biennium
 
02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
2021 advocates um had advocated for that
 
02:03:42.629 --> 02:03:42.639 align:start position:0%
funding to be put in
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
and unsuspend
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
02:03:46.639 --> 02:03:48.390 align:start position:0%
the statute
however

02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
the congregate housing program
 
02:03:53.589 --> 02:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
general funds would only contribute a
 
02:03:56.069 --> 02:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
very small portion to a congregate
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
housing program that no longer has
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
federal funding
 
02:04:01.950 --> 02:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
um so we would not be able to
 
02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
operationalize a congregate housing
 
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
program with those funds therefore we
 
02:04:08.550 --> 02:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
put forward for it to be repealed this
 
02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:11.510 align:start position:0%
put forward for it to be repealed this
time

02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:13.109 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:04:13.109 --> 02:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:16.069 --> 02:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
john williams can chime in in terms of
 
02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
the funding that was put into the budget
 
02:04:19.990 --> 02:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe that it was part of
 
02:04:22.709 --> 02:04:22.719 align:start position:0%
the agency request that the department
 
02:04:24.790 --> 02:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
put forward um
 
02:04:26.470 --> 02:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
getting that funding
 
02:04:28.229 --> 02:04:28.239 align:start position:0%
this is karen and i can actually add to
 
02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
that so that i think um just to add to
 
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
what wendy's saying there
 
02:04:34.709 --> 02:04:34.719 align:start position:0%
the funding wasn't sufficient in fiscal
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
year 20 and 21 in addition to the fact
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
that we um did not have the capacity to
 
02:04:42.149 --> 02:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
stand something like that up because of
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
the other demands on the department um
 
02:04:45.199 --> 02:04:45.990 align:start position:0%
the other demands on the department um
so

02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:48.069 --> 02:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's a clarification
 
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
that needs to be made is that the
 
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
general funds were not enough so it if
 
02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
you took this section out of hb2
 
02:04:56.550 --> 02:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
completely um
 
02:04:59.109 --> 02:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
it would be a mandate without funding
 
02:04:59.119 --> 02:04:59.910 align:start position:0%
it would be a mandate without funding
we

02:04:59.910 --> 02:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
there would have to be general funds
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
added to the budget in addition to
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
positions to run the programs um
 
02:05:08.709 --> 02:05:08.719 align:start position:0%
to be able to take this out of hv2
 
02:05:08.719 --> 02:05:10.149 align:start position:0%
to be able to take this out of hv2
completely

02:05:10.149 --> 02:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
completely
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
to ask a clarifying question it sounds
 
02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
to me like the uh foster grandparent
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
program is distinct really from the
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
congregate housing issue and the
 
02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
congregate housing issue
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
requires a lot more investment than
 
02:05:30.069 --> 02:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
my perception of a grandfather or a
 
02:05:32.709 --> 02:05:32.719 align:start position:0%
grandparent foster program
 
02:05:34.950 --> 02:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
but yet these are being put together and
 
02:05:37.589 --> 02:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
and all of it's being repealed is is
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
everything you're saying about
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
congregate housing being kind of too too
 
02:05:43.750 --> 02:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
expensive to really get off the ground
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
with a little bit of federal money
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
that's been provided is that also true
 
02:05:47.679 --> 02:05:48.470 align:start position:0%
that's been provided is that also true
for

02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:49.510 align:start position:0%
for
the

02:05:49.510 --> 02:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:52.069 --> 02:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
foster grandparent program
 
02:05:54.790 --> 02:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh could we do this could i um
 
02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
i believe that we're tying them together
 
02:05:59.109 --> 02:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
because federally the program was was
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
tied together when it was federally
 
02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
funded so if we could um come back to
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
you on the foster grandparent side and
 
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
just give you a sense of what it would
 
02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:08.390 align:start position:0%
just give you a sense of what it would
cost

02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
to fully implement that program um i
 
02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:14.159 align:start position:0%
think that would be helpful if jonah
 
02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
could add that to the list of questions
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
for the department
 
02:06:20.550 --> 02:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
it would be good for me and mr chair
 
02:06:22.550 --> 02:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
john williams if i could add a
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
historical perspective just for a second
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
i'd rather hear representative walner's
 
02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
question uh we we don't have much more
 
02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
time and we're really looking at the
 
02:06:35.109 --> 02:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
next budget
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
yeah well
 
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
i i i thought that the
 
02:06:41.109 --> 02:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
100 000 for the foster grandparent
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
program was basically
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
a state donation to a to a larger
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
program a program that gets federal
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
funding directly it doesn't flow through
 
02:06:52.149 --> 02:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
the department
 
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't run the program
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's almost like a contract in that they
 
02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
make a contribution to a larger program
 
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:08.709 --> 02:07:08.719 align:start position:0%
i i don't know the answer to that but
 
02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
let me
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
let me get back to you on all of that
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
information because it may be that i
 
02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
misunderstood that
 
02:07:20.709 --> 02:07:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
i i'd like to get back to you with that
 
02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:23.990 align:start position:0%
i i'd like to get back to you with that
information

02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative your hand is up
 
02:07:30.629 --> 02:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
but i would like to see an analysis
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
of how many programs where the staffing
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
exceeds the money distributed
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
i think that sounds like that that's
 
02:07:40.229 --> 02:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
what would have happened with those
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
foster grandparents and the congregate
 
02:07:42.159 --> 02:07:43.189 align:start position:0%
foster grandparents and the congregate
housing

02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
housing
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
that the staffing would have taken all
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
the money and there'd be nothing left to
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
give it to the program i wonder how many
 
02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:49.430 align:start position:0%
give it to the program i wonder how many
other

02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:07:52.629 --> 02:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
programs hhs has where the staffing
 
02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
is greater than the amount that's
 
02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:56.069 align:start position:0%
is greater than the amount that's
distributed

02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
for that program thank you
 
02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
we do that in a two-step
 
02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
answer first step is just to
 
02:08:04.639 --> 02:08:05.669 align:start position:0%
answer first step is just to
verify

02:08:05.669 --> 02:08:05.679 align:start position:0%
verify
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative weiler's observation that
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
maybe the our own internal personnel
 
02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:11.430 align:start position:0%
maybe the our own internal personnel
costs

02:08:11.430 --> 02:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:08:13.350 --> 02:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
tended to exceed the money that we were
 
02:08:16.069 --> 02:08:16.079 align:start position:0%
getting from the feds and and then with
 
02:08:17.350 --> 02:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
that in place
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
get to the second part which is are
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up meeting
 
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
yes i i think the the second question it
 
02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's a difficult
 
02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
question to answer and i need to spend
 
02:08:48.310 --> 02:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
some time thinking about the question
 
02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
and see it in writing um
 
02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
before i can commit to how long it might
 
02:08:55.109 --> 02:08:55.119 align:start position:0%
take to put something like that together
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
that's that's reasonable how about the
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
first part of it where he he he's he's
 
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
drawn the observation from listening to
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
you all
 
02:09:02.719 --> 02:09:03.589 align:start position:0%
you all
that

02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:03.599 --> 02:09:04.390 align:start position:0%
that
the

02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:09:07.910 --> 02:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
cost of our personnel to run the program
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
exceeded the money that we were getting
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
from the federal government
 
02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know that that would be
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily true so i'll
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
i think we can put that into the answer
 
02:09:18.470 --> 02:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
about the foster grandparent program
 
02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:20.550 align:start position:0%
about the foster grandparent program
specifically

02:09:20.550 --> 02:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
that address your issue representative
 
02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:24.470 align:start position:0%
that address your issue representative
weiler

02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
weiler
 
02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
i would think with the computer i.t we
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
have if you looked at
 
02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
any program class 50 plus class 10
 
02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
and then the total cost of the program
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
it would be revealing
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
so that's the sort of information i'm
 
02:09:41.589 --> 02:09:41.599 align:start position:0%
interested in is class 10 and class 50
 
02:09:45.510 --> 02:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
are more than half of the program
 
02:09:47.189 --> 02:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
representative norton
 
02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry did you have a response yeah i
 
02:09:52.550 --> 02:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
was just going to say i do understand
 
02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
that um concept i i think the
 
02:09:57.510 --> 02:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
the issue is that the system is kept by
 
02:09:59.990 --> 02:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
accounting units and there can be
 
02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
several accounting units for each
 
02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
program and several programs within each
 
02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
accounting unit so it's not quite as
 
02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:08.870 align:start position:0%
accounting unit so it's not quite as
simple

02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
simple
 
02:10:13.109 --> 02:10:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:13.119 --> 02:10:14.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:10:14.790 --> 02:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
you took your hand down do you still
 
02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
have a question though ma'am
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:10:20.239 --> 02:10:21.990 align:start position:0%
all right
um

02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative edwards um if i may just
 
02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
be able to answer um representative
 
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
wallner's question
 
02:10:31.109 --> 02:10:31.119 align:start position:0%
in relation to foster grandparent
 
02:10:31.119 --> 02:10:32.069 align:start position:0%
in relation to foster grandparent
program

02:10:32.069 --> 02:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:10:34.149 --> 02:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
um i believe that
 
02:10:37.030 --> 02:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
in the past more than 10 years ago when
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
the program
 
02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:39.910 align:start position:0%
the program
was

02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:10:43.510 --> 02:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
being funded or contracted out it did
 
02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
it did help to
 
02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:46.709 align:start position:0%
it did help to
support

02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
a larger
 
02:10:51.189 --> 02:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
foster grandparent program that existed
 
02:10:51.199 --> 02:10:52.310 align:start position:0%
foster grandparent program that existed
and

02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:55.990 --> 02:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
we did contract that out but the program
 
02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
had been suspended for
 
02:10:58.950 --> 02:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
more than
 
02:11:01.430 --> 02:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
um 10 years so
 
02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:02.870 align:start position:0%
um 10 years so
um

02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:04.550 --> 02:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
we'd have to be able to get back to you
 
02:11:06.629 --> 02:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
in terms of how it would what it would
 
02:11:08.950 --> 02:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
look like if it were funded but my
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it's not funded
 
02:11:13.109 --> 02:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
and it's been suspended for 10 years we
 
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to
 
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
answer that second question in terms of
 
02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
the staffing um it was a contracted out
 
02:11:22.790 --> 02:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
program and we didn't have state staff
 
02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:25.109 align:start position:0%
program and we didn't have state staff
operating

02:11:25.109 --> 02:11:25.119 align:start position:0%
operating
 
02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
so we we have another 10 minutes or so
 
02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:35.750 align:start position:0%
so we we have another 10 minutes or so
um

02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
mr williams with with the the collective
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh genius that's with you is there any
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
part of what we've talked about as a
 
02:11:47.430 --> 02:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
committee that you would like to address
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
or answer for us given that you've heard
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
our conversation and
 
02:11:55.270 --> 02:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
and uh mr chair thank you so much and uh
 
02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
for that opportunity
 
02:12:00.390 --> 02:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh as to the historical context it's
 
02:12:01.750 --> 02:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
very brief but i think it would be
 
02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:02.870 align:start position:0%
very brief but i think it would be
helpful

02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
02:12:04.629 --> 02:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
that on those sections that we're
 
02:12:06.790 --> 02:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
seeking to repeal currently that were
 
02:12:08.709 --> 02:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
suspended for a number of years and i
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
know uh for for representative wyler and
 
02:12:13.990 --> 02:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
other members like rev walner
 
02:12:15.750 --> 02:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
that because they've been suspended for
 
02:12:18.069 --> 02:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
so long we were actually asked by the
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
legislature during the budget process
 
02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
and particularly in the house
 
02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
if you've been suspending these for so
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
many years why don't we in the same way
 
02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
that you identified for example
 
02:12:29.589 --> 02:12:29.599 align:start position:0%
the prospective repeal let's say let's
 
02:12:31.270 --> 02:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
just deal with it now and get it out of
 
02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
the budget so you don't have to deal
 
02:12:34.310 --> 02:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
with moving forward and there have been
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
other examples that mr ripple certainly
 
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
could point to as well as i
 
02:12:39.910 --> 02:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
where you've done some gardening in the
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
past taking out items that no longer are
 
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
required to be part of hp2 we really
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate that because it means it's
 
02:12:48.229 --> 02:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
one less item that has to be identified
 
02:12:49.510 --> 02:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
everybody by ending when you're
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
constructing a budget so whether you
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
suspend our repeal i just wanted to give
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
you the context that it actually was a
 
02:12:57.189 --> 02:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
conversation that happened
 
02:12:59.430 --> 02:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
a couple of budget sessions ago
 
02:13:01.350 --> 02:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
regarding trying to clean up those
 
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
sections but whether it's suspended or
 
02:13:05.669 --> 02:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
repealed as ms rounds had pointed out we
 
02:13:07.750 --> 02:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
just need to have some language in there
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
to cover for us whether you decide
 
02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
eventually to suspend some of those
 
02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
sections or to repeal but i just thought
 
02:13:14.629 --> 02:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful for you to have
 
02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
that that background
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr williams representative do
 
02:13:21.189 --> 02:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
02:13:23.669 --> 02:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
yes i just want to make one further
 
02:13:27.430 --> 02:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
point and that is that if it was in
 
02:13:29.350 --> 02:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
the last budget
 
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
which it is
 
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
the foster grandparent program is at
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
least i know
 
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
if it's in there
 
02:13:39.030 --> 02:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
then it wasn't repealed i mean it
 
02:13:41.430 --> 02:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
obviously wasn't repealed
 
02:13:44.709 --> 02:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
and my question now is
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
if it was in the last budget
 
02:13:50.629 --> 02:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
did they not get their hundred thousand
 
02:13:50.639 --> 02:13:53.750 align:start position:0%
did they not get their hundred thousand
dollars

02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
or alternatively where did that hundred
 
02:13:59.189 --> 02:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars go
 
02:14:00.629 --> 02:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
i don't want to put words in your mouth
 
02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
but you're basically looking for how
 
02:14:04.709 --> 02:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
that hundred thousand dollars actually
 
02:14:07.589 --> 02:14:07.599 align:start position:0%
got used if it did or not
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
this is this is karen um they did not
 
02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
get contracted out and those funds will
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
lapse at
 
02:14:22.450 --> 02:14:22.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:22.460 --> 02:14:23.910 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:14:23.910 --> 02:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up representative
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
no just very disappointed to hear that
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a great program
 
02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:34.229 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a great program
um

02:14:34.229 --> 02:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
02:14:39.750 --> 02:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh i'll come back to you uh mr williams
 
02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:43.189 align:start position:0%
uh i'll come back to you uh mr williams
um

02:14:43.189 --> 02:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:45.109 --> 02:14:45.119 align:start position:0%
is there anything that we've talked
 
02:14:47.109 --> 02:14:47.119 align:start position:0%
about or asked questions about which
 
02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
hasn't already been discussed in the
 
02:14:50.629 --> 02:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
last 40 minutes
 
02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
that the department would like to weigh
 
02:14:56.550 --> 02:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
in on before we close today's hearing
 
02:14:58.950 --> 02:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
so so mr chair i think what would be
 
02:15:01.510 --> 02:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
helpful is i can we can certainly work
 
02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
myself and miss rounds to get to have at
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
the next uh convening the same group of
 
02:15:08.229 --> 02:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
people we have here today just be
 
02:15:10.709 --> 02:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
available to answer questions as you go
 
02:15:12.950 --> 02:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
through the sections to give you some
 
02:15:14.149 --> 02:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
some context at least from the
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
department's perspective on what these
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
actually do and why they're needed as
 
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
part of the language in hb2 but for
 
02:15:23.270 --> 02:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
today it's been a long day and i would
 
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
not want to take up
 
02:15:26.950 --> 02:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
any more of your time unless at your
 
02:15:28.870 --> 02:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
direction you would like us to proceed
 
02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
any further today
 
02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you for that i'm
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
going to actually try one more step
 
02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
forward and uh to the committee
 
02:15:40.950 --> 02:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh there's this section 31 that i i
 
02:15:43.030 --> 02:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
nicknamed the weiler rule
 
02:15:44.310 --> 02:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
on um
 
02:15:47.109 --> 02:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
on being notified if uh if there are any
 
02:15:49.669 --> 02:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
budgetary impacts due to program
 
02:15:49.679 --> 02:15:51.350 align:start position:0%
budgetary impacts due to program
eligibility

02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:52.149 align:start position:0%
eligibility
uh

02:15:52.149 --> 02:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
my note says i assume everyone's okay
 
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:15:55.840 --> 02:15:56.709 align:start position:0%
with that
so

02:15:56.709 --> 02:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:56.719 --> 02:15:57.990 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:15:57.990 --> 02:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:00.310 --> 02:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to get this off of our plate
 
02:16:02.310 --> 02:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
if we can because we have another nine
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
minutes or so um
 
02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:06.149 align:start position:0%
minutes or so um
is

02:16:06.149 --> 02:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
if i could get a motion on accepting
 
02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh section 31
 
02:16:15.589 --> 02:16:15.599 align:start position:0%
that's actually section 32 i'm sorry no
 
02:16:17.910 --> 02:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
i really appreciate you fixing that
 
02:16:20.390 --> 02:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
before we did that thank you
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
so section 32
 
02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:23.669 align:start position:0%
so section 32
um

02:16:23.669 --> 02:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:29.750 --> 02:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
were you going to make a motion
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
to to
 
02:16:32.709 --> 02:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
have the committee accept
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
section 32
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
no i was just trying to find it but uh
 
02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
is there a motion to accept section 32
 
02:16:47.589 --> 02:16:47.599 align:start position:0%
i'll move
 
02:16:47.599 --> 02:16:57.270 align:start position:0%
i'll move
wider

02:16:57.270 --> 02:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:13.509 align:start position:0%
 
second

02:17:13.509 --> 02:17:13.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:16.629 --> 02:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
i just want could i ask kevin a question
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am is it about this motion
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
about section third okay yeah it is and
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
kevin this has been in this is the exact
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
wording that's been in here for quite a
 
02:17:29.110 --> 02:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
few years
 
02:17:30.870 --> 02:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
well off the top of my head i don't want
 
02:17:33.669 --> 02:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
to commit to it being exact but i i
 
02:17:35.030 --> 02:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
i think so
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
right it looks really familiar
 
02:17:40.070 --> 02:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
it looks exact
 
02:17:43.349 --> 02:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
let me just um i think it's been 15
 
02:17:43.359 --> 02:17:44.790 align:start position:0%
let me just um i think it's been 15
years

02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
yeah no i think it does look
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
i just didn't compare it to last year
 
02:17:52.389 --> 02:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
mary kalista's telling me it is exactly
 
02:17:53.349 --> 02:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you you're welcome
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%

thank you so much um
 
02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
i think uh given the time of day and the
 
02:18:42.309 --> 02:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
fact that i wanted to shut down before 2
 
02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
30 i don't know that we have any other
 
02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
um hb2 business that we can take up at
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
this time
 
02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:49.349 align:start position:0%
this time
[Music]

02:18:49.349 --> 02:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:18:51.190 --> 02:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
so i'll just open it up to the committee
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
members if there's uh
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
any comments or feedback that they want
 
02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:57.599 align:start position:0%
to share i think actually representative
 
02:18:59.270 --> 02:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
weiler i'm really going to put you on
 
02:19:01.030 --> 02:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
the spot with this one
 
02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
uh i think i think you made some casual
 
02:19:06.790 --> 02:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
comments before the hearing started and
 
02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh i i would i was distracted at the
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
time but i'm wondering if you want to
 
02:19:12.709 --> 02:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
say that while we're still
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
in a public meeting so that we we've got
 
02:19:16.629 --> 02:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
it on the record do you remember what
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
you were talking about
 
02:19:23.349 --> 02:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
remember you're saying we'll talk about
 
02:19:26.230 --> 02:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
that later but now
 
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
i've had so many things in my mind since
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
i don't remember exactly what i said
 
02:19:32.549 --> 02:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
yes sir i'm sorry to put you on the spot
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
i just i just wanted
 
02:19:37.509 --> 02:19:37.519 align:start position:0%
to make sure we were
 
02:19:39.509 --> 02:19:39.519 align:start position:0%
all being transparent so representative
 
02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
nordgren do you have a comment
 
02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
um we just got a notice from janet that
 
02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
our meeting on monday is at 10 o'clock i
 
02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
just wanted to verify that
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
so if i could comment on that you did
 
02:19:55.429 --> 02:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
get that it doesn't replace the meeting
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
that starts at 9 30 but this gets back
 
02:19:58.950 --> 02:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
to what i was saying earlier about the
 
02:20:01.349 --> 02:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
calendar didn't reference a work session
 
02:20:02.870 --> 02:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
on monday and it didn't reference house
 
02:20:05.349 --> 02:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
bill 1 and 2 specifically
 
02:20:08.309 --> 02:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
so i got in touch with the clerk
 
02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
and he suggested that a new
 
02:20:13.429 --> 02:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
notice be put out for a work session
 
02:20:13.439 --> 02:20:15.110 align:start position:0%
notice be put out for a work session
following

02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
following
 
02:20:17.270 --> 02:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh the monday morning meeting that's
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
already been noticed so janet sent out
 
02:20:19.680 --> 02:20:20.950 align:start position:0%
already been noticed so janet sent out
that

02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
that additional notice for a 10 o'clock
 
02:20:24.389 --> 02:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
work session obviously that'll be
 
02:20:26.070 --> 02:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
delayed in practice
 
02:20:27.429 --> 02:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
when you're done with public health and
 
02:20:28.950 --> 02:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
when you're done with the veterans home
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
you can move on to the work session but
 
02:20:32.230 --> 02:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
as long as it's been properly noticed i
 
02:20:33.429 --> 02:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
think you're good to talk about house
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
bottom line we're still meeting at 9 30.
 
02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:50.309 align:start position:0%
bottom line we're still meeting at 9 30.
yes

02:20:50.309 --> 02:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:50.319 --> 02:20:51.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:55.190 --> 02:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay so um before we uh adjourn for the
 
02:20:57.510 --> 02:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
day does anyone else on the committee
 
02:20:59.590 --> 02:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
have any comments or questions for the
 
02:21:01.590 --> 02:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
good of the committee
 
02:21:04.150 --> 02:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
i can tell you what my intent is my
 
02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:05.349 align:start position:0%
i can tell you what my intent is my
intent

02:21:05.349 --> 02:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
intent
 
02:21:08.550 --> 02:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
is to take the notes that uh i i
 
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
scrambled together today
 
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
and go through them
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
and attempt to um
 
02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh put some thought into when we can
 
02:21:19.349 --> 02:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
come back to some of these subjects at a
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
future date
 
02:21:23.590 --> 02:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
and to and to do that in a way
 
02:21:25.510 --> 02:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
i i don't know that needs to go into an
 
02:21:27.990 --> 02:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
official house calendar notice but i do
 
02:21:30.309 --> 02:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
want to do it in a way in which we can
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
share it with our colleagues over in the
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
department so that
 
02:21:38.309 --> 02:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't waste much time
 
02:21:41.590 --> 02:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
waiting for us that's my intent
 
02:21:46.070 --> 02:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
so um is there any comment question
 
02:21:49.750 --> 02:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
i think what i said earlier was that
 
02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
none of these items had a dollar sign
 
02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
near them so when we vote for hb2
 
02:21:55.120 --> 02:21:55.910 align:start position:0%
near them so when we vote for hb2
it's

02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:21:58.230 --> 02:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
likely adding to the budget but we don't
 
02:22:02.950 --> 02:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:04.950 --> 02:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
i think that's a fair observation in
 
02:22:06.469 --> 02:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
many cases
 
02:22:09.030 --> 02:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
so far it feels to me like the ones that
 
02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:10.630 align:start position:0%
so far it feels to me like the ones that
we've

02:22:10.630 --> 02:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
we've
 
02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:12.389 align:start position:0%
we've
approved

02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
approved
 
02:22:14.389 --> 02:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
didn't have a a
