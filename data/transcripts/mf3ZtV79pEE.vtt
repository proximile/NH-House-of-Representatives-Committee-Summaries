of 343 to nothing
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
the bill moved to the senate where it
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
was amended in the enr committee
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment makes two changes to the
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
bill one technical
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
and one addition
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
the technical change changes the amount
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
of money allocated to the easy board to
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
promote energy efficiency from one
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
percent of the system benefits charge to
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
the addition to the bill
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
when the public utilities commission
 
00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:41.749 align:start position:0%
when the public utilities commission
rejected

00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
rejected
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
the plan for
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
proceeding with energy efficiency back
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
on november 12th
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
it requested the utilities to create a
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
new plan
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
and it imposed several mandates on that
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
the utilities discovered
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
that those mandates made it virtually
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
impossible for them to come up with a
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
so what the senate amendment does is it
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
puts into statute
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
the programming framework and components
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
of the energy efficiency energy
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
efficiency plans that were in effect in
 
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.030 align:start position:0%
efficiency plans that were in effect in
2020

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
2020
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
puts those
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
components into statute
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
so now those energy efficiency programs
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
can once again proceed
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
without this amendment
 
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:35.839 align:start position:0%
hundreds possibly thousands of jobs
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
would be lost
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
and companies might have to cease doing
 
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.670 align:start position:0%
and companies might have to cease doing
business

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
plus the state would lose the benefits
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
of all the energy efficiency projects
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%

i rise to speak in opposition to house
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
bill 1469 as amended
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
originally the prime sponsor presented
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
this bill as necessary against the
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote woke culture
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
he repeatedly used this term but when
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
asked to define it even by our chair he
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
was unable to provide a definition
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
in the majority report there's reference
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
to china and the use of certain criteria
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
and business transactions
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
it was stated this bill would prevent
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
such practices in this country
 
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.750 align:start position:0%
such practices in this country
frankly

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
arguments in this direction absent any
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
facts or concerns and possibly based on
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
internet posts is not a basis for new
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire law the new hampshire bankers
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
association certainly agreed with the
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor that banks and businesses
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
should not discriminate based on
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
subjective or arbitrary standards
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
like social media posts and they stated
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
such in testimony both orally and in
 
00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:27.830 align:start position:0%
such in testimony both orally and in
writing

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
writing
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
the committee heard testimony from the
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
if this office had to review a charge of
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
discrimination it would be difficult it
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
would be a difficult investigation or
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
prosecution and sent a written policy
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely that a bank or business
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
would specifically discriminate in
 
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:44.950 align:start position:0%
would specifically discriminate in
writing

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
writing
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
the types of discrimination outlined in
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
furthermore there are
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination statutes in place
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
already making this bill completely
 
00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.510 align:start position:0%
already making this bill completely
unnecessary

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
i would argue that we do not need
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
another law against discrimination
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
making it more difficult for businesses
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
and banks to conduct lawful business in
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
banks are already subject to strict
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
this bill would add more regulation to
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
our banking department
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
but with added difficulties in
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%

00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
the majority of the commerce and

consumer affairs committee recognizes
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
the emergence of a threat of a form of
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
discrimination that is equally as
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
repugnant as the practice of redlining
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
that was commonly practiced by banks and
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
financial institutions for many decades
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
and the committee recommends house bill
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
1469 ought to pass as amended
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
the emerging threat is a form of
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
financial discrimination that includes
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
but certainly is not limited to

banks and other financial institutions
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
using non-financial criteria as a basis
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%

criteria
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
this is social credit scoring as what is
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
occurring in china and is apparently
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
beginning to happen in canada and it has
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
no place here in the united states
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
this bill would prohibit the banks
 
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
from controlling
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
your access
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
to your money
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
in order to control your behavior to fit
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
their ideologies
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
if you think it hasn't happened or isn't
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
happening it is happening and it's
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
happening with greater frequency
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
just this past week td bank decided to
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
seize the monies that had been donated
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
to the truckers in canada and turn this
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
money over to the government the
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
canadian government
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
no laws had been broken
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
the bank just decided they did not agree
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
with the cause that the money was raised
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
for refused to turn it over to their to
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
the proper recipients instead give it
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
over to the canadian government
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
just this morning
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
a fellow american business owner
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
mike lindell stated that his bank cut
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
him off
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
he hadn't broken the law
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
they just simply disagreed with his
 
00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.230 align:start position:0%
they just simply disagreed with his
opinions

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
opinions
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
whether you think he's a kook or whether
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
you think he's right
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
that's not the bank's decision to make
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
those who would naively say this will
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
never happen need to look at history
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
because someone said about loading up a
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
bunch of people onto trains and sending
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
them off to gas chambers that will never
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
happen and yet it did
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
rather than waiting for history of
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
abuses and then taking action to try to
 
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
correct the problem the majority of the
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
committee believes preventing abuses in
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
the first place is a better course of
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
action and recommends house bill 1469
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%

it is sufficiently seconded this will be

so

00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%

mr speaker
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%

fully prohibited in new hampshire
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%

banking transactions
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this bill intrudes on
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
the rights of businesses to assess
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
whether a client or customer is an
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate fit for their product
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%

general's office feels that compliance
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
with the vague language of this bill
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
is unenforceable
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%

already passed a bill
 
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:11.839 align:start position:0%

though some may say we can't pass 1468
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
because it will conflict with other
 
00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.510 align:start position:0%
because it will conflict with other
bills

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%

cannabis
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%

state laws at all
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%

state of new hampshire that cannot
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
afford a tape recorder we have bigger
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
problems on our hands than meatloaf
 
00:50:36.079 --> 00:50:38.150 align:start position:0%
problems on our hands than meatloaf
songs

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
songs
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
it is very inexpensive
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
most departments already have it
 
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
and furthermore our constitution
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
protects the individual rights of our
 
00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.829 align:start position:0%
protects the individual rights of our
citizens

00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
their day in court and to have a fair
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
interaction with the police department
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
color me shocked that the new hampshire
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
chiefs of police association don't want
 
00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
to have to record all of their
 
00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:06.829 align:start position:0%
to have to record all of their
interactions

00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
interactions
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this is the wave of the
 
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
future this is what's happening across
 
00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
the country and it's the best thing for
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
our citizens and it's the best thing for
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
the police
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
if the police are concerned about
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
allegations of false confessions there's
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
no what better way to prove it than that
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
produce the actual video and audio
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
recording of
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
the interrogation
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is the best for the citizens
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
and for law enforcement
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%

as you do
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
that every police station does not have

and if i know
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
that some police stations would have to
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker i rise in
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
opposition to floor amendment zero four
 
01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
one seven each
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
what this what this amendment would do
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
is create a three hundred thousand
 
01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
dollar fine
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
if if someone were to provide cannabis
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
to a miner although if that is not a i
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
don't support providing cannabis to
 
01:05:37.359 --> 01:05:38.309 align:start position:0%
don't support providing cannabis to
minors

01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
minors
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
and the bill has written would have a
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
age restriction of 21 years or older
 
01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.510 align:start position:0%
age restriction of 21 years or older
however

01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
it is felt that that fine would be
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
excessive considering what the
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
offense would be
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
and that that policy provision was not
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
considered by the committee
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
and therefore i would
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
ask everyone to oppose the amendment and
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%

questions that have not been addressed
 
01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.950 align:start position:0%

1598 casts a shadow on each of these
responsibilities

01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
the first intent of this bill is to
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
legalize marijuana
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
it does this despite nearly 10 years
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
worth of data from other states
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
which documents how legalization in
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
their states has led to a marked
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
increase in underage marijuana use
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
a doubling of marijuana-related traffic
 
01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:33.750 align:start position:0%
a doubling of marijuana-related traffic
deaths

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
an immediate rise in child welfare cases
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
in infants being born with thc present
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
in their bloodstream and a marked uptick
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
in hospital documented mental illness
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%

01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
in teens and young adults
 
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
despite these tragic consequences we
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
continue to find ourselves going up the
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
same tired arguments that legalization
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
is inevitable and it's time for us to
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
catch up with the other train wrecks
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's happening in other states
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
and to add insult to injury
 
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes that we use 25
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars of
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%

01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
and add to add insult to injury this
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
bill proposes that we use 25 million
 
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
dollars of the marijuana profits to fund
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
drug addiction treatment to help
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
mitigate a problem we ourselves will
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
have made far worse
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
another intent of this bill is to
 
01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate 14 million dollars of
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money for start-up costs so the
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire liquor commission could
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
manage 10 state-run retail outlets to
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
sell marijuana to the public
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission estimates 5
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
million a year will be needed for
 
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
operating costs salaries and benefits
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
for 70 state employees to sell high
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
concentrate marijuana
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
now let's just discuss the transparency
 
01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
a public hearing was held on the
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
original bill and then overnight the
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
bill was amended with three pages of a
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
banking service proposals and the
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
amendment was taken up in the executive
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
session and criminal justice committee
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
the next day with little or no
 
01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.630 align:start position:0%
the next day with little or no
discussion

01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
if that's not alarming enough the
 
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
amendment contingently appropriates 10
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars to execute a banking
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
scheme in order for new hampshire to
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
process the anticipated windfall of
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
profits generated by marijuana sales
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
this bank scheme is being proposed so
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire can navigate federal laws
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
that prohibit banks from accepting money
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
garnered through the sale of a federally
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
illegal drug
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
however the u.s treasury department's
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
financial crimes enforcement network
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines still affirm that any bank
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
used to process cash
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
from marijuana sales remain subject to
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
prosecution regardless of state law
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
another concerning aspect of the
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
proposed bank scheme is the language
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
which states that the board of directors
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
for this bank
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
shall quote consist solely of the
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
executive director of the business
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
finance authority
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
the attorney general of the state and
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
the state's treasurer
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
is this really a good look for our state
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
to have the state's chief law
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer and the state's
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
chief banker sitting on the board of a
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
private marijuana bank
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
in one fell swoop
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
remember we'll suspend for a minute
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's getting awful loud in here the
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
member has a right
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
to be heard please keep it down
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
if you need to have a conversation take
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
it outside member may continue thank you
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
in one fell swoop not only does this
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
bill aim to legalize a drug that we know
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
will result in more harm to our most
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations it also empowers
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state agencies to
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
essentially act as a cartel
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
a drug dealer and a money launderer all
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
in one
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
lastly we need to look no further than
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
the majority report to understand how
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice committee sees the
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
purpose of this amended bill
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
quote this bill as amended allows
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
consumers to purchase a clean superior
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
tax-free product at a consumer-friendly
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
price that is competitive with the black
 
01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.790 align:start position:0%
price that is competitive with the black
market

01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
so the state of new hampshire wants to
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
be protect competitive with the black
 
01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.149 align:start position:0%
be protect competitive with the black
market

01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
surely we can be better than this
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
here are some questions about 1598 that
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
i would like everyone to consider
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
why was the public given practically no
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
ability to comment on the massive
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
banking scheme proposed in the amendment
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
will anybody be honest and admit how
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
unhappy the liquor commission is to be
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
entrapped in the oversight and
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
management of the stanks of the state
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
sanctioned marijuana stores
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
was an agency consulted before the
 
01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
extensive banking scheme amended
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
amendment was added to the bill
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
did someone from the legislative or
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
executive branch ask the new hampshire
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
business authority executive director to
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
write the amended banking language to
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
comply with the federal bank secrecy act
 
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
on money laundering
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
and why does the bill indemnify bank
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
employees and provide for this bank to
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
have quote a distinct and legal legal
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
existence separate from the state is
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
this an admission that the state
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
government officials are worried about
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
liability stemming from the sale of high
 
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
concentrate thc to the public
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
in closing here are the final questions
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'd like us to consider
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
are we practicing good governance by
 
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
operating a cartel like marijuana
 
01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.950 align:start position:0%
operating a cartel like marijuana
monopoly

01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
monopoly
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
is the state of new hampshire protecting
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
public health by selling addictive high
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
concentrate manila marijuana to its
 
01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:46.870 align:start position:0%
concentrate manila marijuana to its
citizens

01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
especially given that it was just
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
reported that drug overdose deaths in
 
01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
nashua and manchester recently hit an
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
all-time high since 2018.
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
are we spending taxpayers money wisely
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
by appropriating millions of dollars to
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
promote and profit from
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
drug use rather than do what we can to
 
01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
mitigate our current drug epidemic
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
are we conducting our legislative duties
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
transparency transparently by rushing
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
through an extensive banking amendment
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
that is intended to navigate around
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
federal banking laws
 
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
are we really going to sacrifice the
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
welfare of our citizens over the false
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
promise of marijuana revenue with no
 
01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.390 align:start position:0%
promise of marijuana revenue with no
downside

01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
downside
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
aren't the lives of our most vulnerable
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
among us worth more than that
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
simply put new hampshire has widely
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
wisely held the line on marijuana
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
legalization we do not need to become
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
the first in the nation drug cartel now
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%

01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
may i ask a question i'm wondering if
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
the representative is aware of recent
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
studies out of colorado and other states
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
where marijuana is legal that it's
 
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
actually resulted in a decrease
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
in the use by minors contrary to what
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
you have just reported
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry sir i can't i can't really
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
fully understand stan what you're saying
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
colorado has recently reported a
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
decrease in the use of marijuana by
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
minors as a result of legalization i'm
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
wondering if you are aware
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
of those studies and similar ones coming
 
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
out of other states where marijuana is
 
01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.229 align:start position:0%
out of other states where marijuana is
legal

legal
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of the fact that colorado is
 
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
actually trying to claw back on some of
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
their some of their legalization
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
measures because it's been an absolute
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
disaster i'm also aware that in oklahoma
 
01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's a state actually i do work for
 
01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.110 align:start position:0%
it's a state actually i do work for
remotely

01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
they've actually they don't have
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
legalization but they actually allow the
 
01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:03.910 align:start position:0%
legalization but they actually allow the
growing

01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
growing
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%

their farms in rural oklahoma have been
 
01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
bought up
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
and they have been transformed into
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
these cartel businesses they've had a
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
rush of three types of cartels chinese
 
01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
mexican in eastern european
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
every couple months or so they actually
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
keep changing hands as a money
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
laundering way to sell their farms at
 
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
high profit it's it's a genie out of a
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
bottle and they can't get it back
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
thank you remember yield a further
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
question sure
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%

both sides of the aisle are making an
 
01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
i'm asking
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
let's respect the speakers and the
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
questions that are being asked please
 
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
if you need to have a conversation take
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr speaker thank you

very much for the representative
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
from hollis i believe for taking the
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
question is it not true that
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
hb 1598
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
although differs in some details is very
 
01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.630 align:start position:0%
although differs in some details is very
similar

01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
similar
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
to a
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
to a
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
bill that was passed
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
just in the last couple of years and
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
it's very popular
 
01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
sorry sir i can't answer that question
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
because i'm
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'm new to legislature this is my first
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
year so i haven't i haven't seen what
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
was passed to massachusetts last couple
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
years although i do know from
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
massachusetts that marijuana sales
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
actually have just overtaken it's only
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
taken less than two years of marijuana
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
sales of actually overtaking liquor
 
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
sales in that state
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
is it remember yield a further question
 
01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
no i think we're done here remember it
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:17.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
colleagues

01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
the last time we met as a body
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
i stood here
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
and asked you to consider a different
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis bill
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
it's one that would have legalized
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
regulated and taxed cannabis sales in
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
hb 1598 the bill before us today has no
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
taxes whatsoever
 
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
cannabis would be sold to adults 21 plus
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
under the auspices of the liquor
 
01:17:42.719 --> 01:17:44.310 align:start position:0%
under the auspices of the liquor
commission

01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
the state would earn revenue the same
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
way it does with liquor sales by buying
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
it wholesale and selling at retail
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
by avoiding taxes this bill would raise
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
substantially more money each year
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
that money would pay for two important
 
01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.350 align:start position:0%
that money would pay for two important
things

01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
substance abuse treatment and education
 
01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.870 align:start position:0%
substance abuse treatment and education
funding

01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
specifically revenues would be used to
 
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
lower the state education property tax
 
01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
tax relief
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
education funding
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
substance abuse treatment these are
 
01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.149 align:start position:0%
substance abuse treatment these are
concepts

01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
concepts
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
just about everybody in our state can
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
get behind
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
as noted this bill would place
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory oversight of cannabis with
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
the state liquor commission that agency
 
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
already has ample experience regulating
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
controlled substances and keeping them
 
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
away from children
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
the agency is also pretty good at doing
 
01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.070 align:start position:0%
the agency is also pretty good at doing
business

01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify a point that was
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
just made the liquor commission took no
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
the bill contemplates at least initially
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
only 10 cannabis outlets that would
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
prevent the oversaturation of cannabis
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
shops that other states including maine
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
are now experiencing
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
so to recap we have a chance to deliver
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
tax relief
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
education funding
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
new money for substance abuse treatment
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
and legalize a product that majority
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
upon majority of new hampshire residents
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
say they want
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
this is a big win for our state
 
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
colleagues i ask that we pass it it's
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%

speech we had earlier on all the

negative sides of this
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i rise in support
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee's recommendation of
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
hb 1598 as amended is a compromise
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
by many who favor recreational cannabis
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
and many who like me
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
that have traditionally opposed
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
recreational cannabis
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
hb 1598 as amended creates a policy like
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
no other state that works for and serves
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
rather than create a separate commission
 
01:20:22.629 --> 01:20:22.639 align:start position:0%
in new bureaucracy recreational cannabis
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
will be regulated by the liquor
 
01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:24.950 align:start position:0%
will be regulated by the liquor
commission

01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
sold in a similar manner as our state
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
sells liquor
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
the benefits of this model which new
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire already has the infrastructure
 
01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
in place for
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
is that new hampshire will be selling
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
a clean superior tax-free product at a
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
lower price than any of the surrounding
 
01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:43.189 align:start position:0%
lower price than any of the surrounding
states

01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
this will encourage out-of-state
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
consumers to purchase cannabis in new
 
01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.070 align:start position:0%
consumers to purchase cannabis in new
hampshire

01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
other states made
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
the mistake of electing high taxes and
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
costly regulations and this caused
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
retail prices
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
to significantly exceed the illegal
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
market price
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's tax-free price will
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
remain competitive with the illegal
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
market and therefore consumers would
 
01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
have no incentive
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
to purchase cannabis illegally
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
furthermore similar to how other states
 
01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:11.910 align:start position:0%
furthermore similar to how other states
are

01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
similar similar to how our state
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
strategically locates the state liquor
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
stores retail cannabis stores will fall
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
in this past this mitigates some of the
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
potential negative impacts
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
because there will not be retail stores
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
the revenue from this bill
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
which is believed to exceed the revenue
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
from any other recreational cannabis
 
01:21:33.679 --> 01:21:36.310 align:start position:0%
from any other recreational cannabis
bill

01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:38.480 align:start position:0%

01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
as as what to do with that revenue the
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
first 25 million dollars in net revenue
 
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
will be specifically allocated to
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%

education property tax
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%

01:29:58.229 --> 01:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
school system consistently ranks as one
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
of the very best in the nation
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
but because new hampshire still ranks
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
50th in the nation in state funding for
 
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
public schools the cost of operating our
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
community public schools which are open
 
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
to all children
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
falls squarely on the backs of local
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
in fact for most of us the property
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
taxes collected locally to support our
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
schools is the largest chunk of that
 
01:30:26.639 --> 01:30:27.430 align:start position:0%
schools is the largest chunk of that
check

01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
check
 
01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
we send twice a year to our town or city
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
tax collectors
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
granite staters are also frugal and we
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
cherish our local control
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
local voters elect local officials and
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
charge them with creating a responsible
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
budget in an open and transparent manner
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
and with overseeing how our tax dollars
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
are spent
 
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
these locally elected officials are
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
answerable to the voters to you and me
 
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
and if we are not happy we can and often
 
01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:03.830 align:start position:0%
and if we are not happy we can and often
do

01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
vote them out
 
01:31:09.629 --> 01:31:09.639 align:start position:0%
that is why i urge you to support hb
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
1516 which simply states that education
 
01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
property taxes collected locally shall
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
not be used as a source of funds for
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
education freedom accounts
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
those accounts as you will remember are
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
overseen and administered by a
 
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
scholarship granting organization
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
who makes all the decisions about how
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
the money is spent
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
this organization is not answerable to
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
us the local voters
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire communities fulfill their
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation to provide a
 
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
free education to its children through
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
their local public schools we pay for
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
them through our local taxes we deserve
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
a right to say how they are spent
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
if the state wishes to offer other
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
educational choices
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
different from our locally paid for
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
public schools it certainly can do so
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
and in fact has done so with the passage
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
of the budget
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
passing hb 15 will not impact the
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
voucher program established in hb2 in
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
any way
 
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
that program is being funded through the
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and the general
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
fund with taxes collected by the state
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
locally collected education property
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
taxes are not being used to fund that
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
program now
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
hb 1516
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
simply seeks to keep it that way
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
if you agree with me that local school
 
01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
taxes should be used to fund local
 
01:32:51.510 --> 01:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
public schools and that the expenditure
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
of local funds should be overseen by
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
locally elected officials answerable to
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
us the voters
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
to you and me
 
01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
then please vote no on the ito motion on
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
this bill so another motion can be made
 
01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
speaker do you recognize representative
 
01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:09.510 align:start position:0%
speaker do you recognize representative
cordelli

01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr speaker and mr speaker i
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
request a roll call vote
 
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
and so it starts
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
the attacks on the education freedom
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
account program
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
one of 17 such attacks
 
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
we will be discussing
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
death by a thousand cuts or so they hope
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
i almost don't know what to say about
 
01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.189 align:start position:0%
i almost don't know what to say about
this

01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
it is all over the place as you can see
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
in the minority report
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
first as the speaker just indicated
 
01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
education freedom accounts are funded by
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
the state education trust fund no local
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
funds are involved
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
it is a state tax
 
01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
this bill does and the program does not
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
use local funds
 
01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
maybe they've been confused with a bill
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
that we tabled earlier this year that
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
did do that
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
the argument in the minority report
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
switches to the use of taxpayer funds
 
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
to pay for religious schools
 
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
i guess the argument is now that
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
education freedom accounts are okay as
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
long as funds aren't used to send kids
 
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
to religious schools
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
the u.s supreme court has ruled in
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
numerous occasions that funds go to the
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
families who are then free to choose the
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
program option that meets their child's
 
01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:26.950 align:start position:0%
program option that meets their child's
needs

01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
most recently espinoza versus montana
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
and going all the way back to pierce
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
versus society of sisters in 1924
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
in which the court stated
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
a child is not a mere creature of the
 
01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:42.709 align:start position:0%
a child is not a mere creature of the
state

01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
love that line
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
all the supreme court decisions have
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
said that when funds go to a family they
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
are no longer public funds they are
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
private funds and it is their choice on
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
how to use the funds
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
to exclude religious schools now that
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
would be unconstitutional as the
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
supremes have said on many occasions
 
01:35:08.709 --> 01:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
but what other supreme courts would bill
 
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
supporters have us ignore
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
any suggestions
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
i could offer one
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
we just heard about local control
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
well i believe the best form of local
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
control is parental control and that's
 
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
what this program is all about
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
so the approach here is to throw things
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
at the wall and see what sticks
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
maybe that's the only way to attack a
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
popular and successful program that
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
helps children
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
i started out by saying that i almost
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
don't know what to say about this bill
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
but after thinking about it i do know
 
01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
what to say
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
zimcadelli has requested a roll calls
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's officially seconded
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:21.970 align:start position:0%

01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
house will come to order the chair
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative cornell for a
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker if i believe that
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill is to protect
 
01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
local taxpayers dollars and to keep them
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
local and if i know that there were only
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
four people online who registered to
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
and if i know that my constituents do
 
01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
not want their local school tax money
 
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
paying for educational freedom accounts
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
out of the district but instead going to
 
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
their local public schools
 
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
if you agree with me that local tax
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
dollars should remain in local schools
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
please join me and press the red button
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
so another notion can be made thank you
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative ladd for
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry thank you very

01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
win
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's a win for the kids who will be
 
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
getting nutritious foods rather than the
 
01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:35.679 align:start position:0%
packaged foods found in many school
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
lunches and snacks
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%

about where their food comes from
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's a win for local
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
family farmers to have increased
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
visibility in a new local market
 
01:45:52.709 --> 01:45:52.719 align:start position:0%
and the final win is for communities by
 
01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
providing opportunities to build family
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
and community engagement through
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
supporting our local family farms and
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%

yes new hampshire like all states
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%

the costs of cities town schools and our
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
own legislature
 
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
money we probably would have not
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
preferred to have if we could bypass the
 
01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
two years of
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
stress illness and inconvenience but
 
01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:53.669 align:start position:0%
stress illness and inconvenience but
alas

01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
alas
 
01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
there was one positive result that has
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
been the schools of the new hampshire
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
like most states began to offer all
 
01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
children breakfast and lunch daily
 
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
we've heard stories about teachers staff
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
parents and volunteers delivering meals
 
01:54:10.870 --> 01:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
via the school bus
 
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
every day stop by stop during the first
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
year of the pandemic when most children
 
01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
were home
 
01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
this process was supplemented by
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
multiple programs on meals for weekends
 
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
we'd like to start like programs like 68
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
hours of hunger thinking just one
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
most communities have something to help
 
01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
reduce the food needs for children
 
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the weekends
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
money to communities are provided to run
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
food feeding programs for children out
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
of schools and recreational sites
 
01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
throughout the summer months for the
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
same reason
 
01:54:43.350 --> 01:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
food is scarce or non-existent
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis for many of our new
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire children
 
01:54:49.589 --> 01:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
we recognize homelessness
 
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
as is prevalent in almost every city in
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
town new hampshire
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
and it's in the newspapers for one
 
01:54:57.910 --> 01:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
reason or another almost every day
 
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
but food insecurity
 
01:55:02.229 --> 01:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
not knowing when or where your next meal
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
will come from
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
is a real thing for our students
 
01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
research is chock full of data that
 
01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679 align:start position:0%
connects good nutrition
 
01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
and student success
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
kids need nutritional food to fuel their
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
brains in their bodies
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
i would guess that many of us in this
 
01:55:24.070 --> 01:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
room usually
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
just grab a cup of coffee in a suite and
 
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
we're on our way
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
a good choice
 
01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
probably not
 
01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
but for a host of reasons
 
01:55:36.390 --> 01:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
we had the option
 
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
there was food in the house
 
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
but we had the money to stop at the
 
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
corner store or gas station or dunkin or
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
pay four bucks at starbucks for a cup of
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
java by the way that four bucks would
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
pay for 10 students to have a
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
nutritional breakfast and lunch for one
 
01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:52.709 align:start position:0%
nutritional breakfast and lunch for one
day

01:55:52.709 --> 01:55:52.719 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
at school under hb 1660.
 
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
the point is
 
01:55:59.830 --> 01:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
that way too many kids do not have the
 
01:56:02.229 --> 01:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
basic food at home or their parents or
 
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
single parent
 
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
do not have enough money to buy
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
breakfast for the kids
 
01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
i bet that
 
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
like me
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
many of your parents made you have
 
01:56:13.109 --> 01:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
breakfast every single day before going
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
out to school
 
01:56:16.149 --> 01:56:16.159 align:start position:0%
my dad would lecture me on a regular
 
01:56:16.159 --> 01:56:17.109 align:start position:0%
my dad would lecture me on a regular

01:56:17.109 --> 01:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
how breakfast is the most important meal
 
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
of the day
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
for those of you that took cycle 101
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
many moons ago
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
just think back on maslow's hierarchy
 
01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:28.709 align:start position:0%
just think back on maslow's hierarchy
needs

01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
or if you can't recall what it was i
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
recommend that maybe you google it after
 
01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:35.679 align:start position:0%
the lieutenant is done giving his pi
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
maslow was right then and he's right now
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
i began a few minutes ago talking about
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
a plus a positive resolution
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
that hidden under the multiple layers of
 
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
gloom and aggravation is one
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
children had food daily
 
01:56:55.510 --> 01:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
all yes all children had access to food
 
01:56:57.589 --> 01:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
not free food by any means
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
our taxes paid for it but children had
 
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
food at least five days a week that they
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
and their parents could count on
 
01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
i listened at the exec session and read
 
01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
in the blue calendar a quote that was
 
01:57:09.599 --> 01:57:10.870 align:start position:0%
in the blue calendar a quote that was
made

01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
it's the parents responsibility
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
remind you another quote
 
01:57:19.109 --> 01:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
that said just let them eat cake
 
01:57:22.149 --> 01:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
the reality is there is no food on the
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
table or in this case in their stomachs
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
and we're wasting millions of new
 
01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire tax dollars trying to educate
 
01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
kids when they're hungry and unfed on a
 
01:57:33.669 --> 01:57:33.679 align:start position:0%

01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen that's hb 16-16

low-income guidelines
 
01:57:45.669 --> 01:57:45.679 align:start position:0%
this isn't like the current covert
 
01:57:48.149 --> 01:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
response where every child regardless of
 
01:57:50.790 --> 01:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
family income gets a female at school

02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%

speak against the committee report
 
02:12:54.149 --> 02:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr speaker
 
02:12:57.189 --> 02:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
house bill 1684 requires the education
 
02:12:59.910 --> 02:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
freedom account program to be held to
 
02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
budgeted amounts isn't that what we do
 
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
for state-run programs
 
02:13:06.629 --> 02:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
isn't this what we do for programs that
 
02:13:09.589 --> 02:13:09.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes are hard to budget for
 
02:13:12.229 --> 02:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
isn't this what we do for dcyf and the
 
02:13:14.229 --> 02:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
budget for caseworkers
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
isn't this what we do to support people
 
02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
with developmental disabilities
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
but the education freedom account
 
02:13:24.310 --> 02:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
program isn't held to its budget
 
02:13:26.790 --> 02:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
last june the department of education
 
02:13:28.470 --> 02:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
recommended a budget
 
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
of twenty nine thousand dollars
 
02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
and by november costs had exceeded eight
 
02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:13:39.430 --> 02:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
so how did this happen
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
the department used participation rates
 
02:13:44.629 --> 02:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
based on a similar program in arizona
 
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
the department estimated that 75 percent
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
of students who participate
 
02:13:51.910 --> 02:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
would directly be coming from exiting
 
02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
their public schools
 
02:13:55.830 --> 02:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
according to the department the savings
 
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
advantage for new hampshire taxpayers is
 
02:14:00.550 --> 02:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
when a student leaves their public
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
school to enter the voucher program
 
02:14:06.149 --> 02:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
presumably presumably saving the local
 
02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
property taxpayer from having to pay the
 
02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
per pupil cost to educate this student
 
02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
and not costing the state any more than
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
it was already paying to the student
 
02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
school district
 
02:14:20.870 --> 02:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
but that's not what happened
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
instead most of the students who signed
 
02:14:25.109 --> 02:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
up were already attending private
 
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
schools or being homeschooled these
 
02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
students had already made the choice to
 
02:14:31.270 --> 02:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
leave their public school and weren't
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
costing the state a dime
 
02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
but now we're all paying for it
 
02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
not the budgeted amount of 129 thousand
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
dollars but more than eight million
 
02:14:40.079 --> 02:14:41.589 align:start position:0%
dollars but more than eight million
dollars

02:14:41.589 --> 02:14:41.599 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
and that number's going up
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
not because the program is wildly
 
02:14:45.599 --> 02:14:46.790 align:start position:0%
not because the program is wildly
successful

02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
successful
 
02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
not because it's quote freeing students
 
02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
from quote oppressive public schools
 
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
but the numbers going up because it's a
 
02:14:56.470 --> 02:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
blank check to make taxpayers pay for
 
02:14:58.550 --> 02:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
someone else's private school tuition
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
and homeschool costs
 
02:15:02.950 --> 02:15:02.960 align:start position:0%

02:15:14.149 --> 02:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
house bill 1684 would stop this runaway

train
 
02:15:16.870 --> 02:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
the department of education would be
 
02:15:21.430 --> 02:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
held to present and defend a budget
 
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
that goes to the stated objectives
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
for instance to provide students from
 
02:15:29.189 --> 02:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
low-income backgrounds access to
 
02:15:31.830 --> 02:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
education opportunities outside of their
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
and they could be questioned by
 
02:15:37.510 --> 02:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
lawmakers to make sure taxpayer money is
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
actually being used to open doors for
 
02:15:42.390 --> 02:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
students and families
 
02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
i hope the house will look favorably on
 
02:15:47.589 --> 02:15:47.599 align:start position:0%
truth and budgeting budget integrity and
 
02:15:49.669 --> 02:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
the obligation to spend taxpayer money
 
02:15:49.679 --> 02:15:50.870 align:start position:0%
the obligation to spend taxpayer money
wisely

02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
wisely
 
02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't kill the program it
 
02:15:56.470 --> 02:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
lets the efa program both succeed and be
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible at the same time
 
02:16:02.310 --> 02:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
please vote no on the motion of itl so
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
that another motion can be made to
 
02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
protect taxpayers and accommodate
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
students already in the program thank
 
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
you does the member yield for a question
 
02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
the member from shuffling borough
 
02:16:17.430 --> 02:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative cordelia is recognized
 
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
speak in support of the committee report
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and i request a
 
02:16:24.790 --> 02:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
roll call vote
 
02:16:27.189 --> 02:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
here it is attack number two
 
02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
this bill would establish an arbitrary
 
02:16:31.510 --> 02:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
budget for the education freedom account
 
02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:32.790 align:start position:0%
budget for the education freedom account
program

02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
this bill would decimate the program
 
02:16:37.389 --> 02:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
it would throw
 
02:16:39.429 --> 02:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
1800 kids
 
02:16:41.349 --> 02:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
out of the program who are currently
 
02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
being helped
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
and possibly force parents to pay back
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
any efa funds they have used to educate
 
02:16:51.750 --> 02:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
their children this year can you imagine
 
02:16:55.349 --> 02:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
that how can we possibly let that happen
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
the goal of this program is evidently
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
aimed at the number of children that can
 
02:17:02.150 --> 02:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the program
 
02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
people are clearly scared of the success
 
02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
of this program as measured by the
 
02:17:11.349 --> 02:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
number of students electing for efas
 
02:17:13.349 --> 02:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
the minority report
 
02:17:15.429 --> 02:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
says that the department of education
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
and i quote should be held accountable
 
02:17:20.790 --> 02:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
because of their estimates and
 
02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
underestimating the number of students
 
02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
taking efas
 
02:17:26.709 --> 02:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
but this bill has nothing to do with the
 
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
department the bill would punish
 
02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
families and children who are just
 
02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
trying to find the best education to
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
meet their needs
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
what would bill supporters tell parents
 
02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
and kids who are kicked out of the
 
02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:43.349 align:start position:0%
and kids who are kicked out of the
program

02:17:43.349 --> 02:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
program

mr speaker
 
02:20:32.550 --> 02:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
if i know that the department of
 
02:20:35.349 --> 02:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
education originally estimated the cost
 
02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
of the education freedom voucher program
 
02:20:41.190 --> 02:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
at 129 000
 
02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
but it actually cost 8.1 million this
 
02:20:44.479 --> 02:20:45.349 align:start position:0%
but it actually cost 8.1 million this
year

02:20:45.349 --> 02:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:20:49.830 --> 02:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
a 6 000 percent miscalculation
 
02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the legislative
 
02:20:54.550 --> 02:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
budget assistant has calculated the
 
02:20:56.870 --> 02:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
projected risk of this program to the
 
02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayer at 70 million dollars a year
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
given the number of private school and
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
home school
 
02:21:06.550 --> 02:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
currently enrolled students that are
 
02:21:09.750 --> 02:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
likely to enroll in the program
 
02:21:12.309 --> 02:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
and if i believe that few hard-working
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire families would even
 
02:21:17.110 --> 02:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
consider betting the farm
 
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
against a
 
02:21:22.950 --> 02:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
poorly estimated quickly adopted
 
02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:24.150 align:start position:0%
poorly estimated quickly adopted
and

02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:26.550 --> 02:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
scheme that hardly anyone truly
 
02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
understands and that every family
 
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
knows how important it is to stick to
 
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
the family budget
 
02:21:36.870 --> 02:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
would i now press the red button to vote
 
02:21:39.270 --> 02:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
against the committee report so that
 
02:21:42.870 --> 02:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:44.469 --> 02:21:44.479 align:start position:0%

02:21:56.550 --> 02:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is yet another attempt to
 
02:21:56.560 --> 02:21:57.830 align:start position:0%

02:21:59.830 --> 02:21:59.840 align:start position:0%

and if i also know the average cost to
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
sustain a child in the new hampshire
 
02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:08.560 align:start position:0%

02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars per student
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
while the cost for an efa account per
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
student is only one quarter the state
 
02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
per pupil cost
 
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
and if i know this program is
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
wildly success successful
 
02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:25.600 align:start position:0%

02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%

every voter would receive
four

02:26:15.349 --> 02:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
four
 
02:26:18.070 --> 02:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
25 dollar certificates that they could
 
02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:19.270 align:start position:0%
25 dollar certificates that they could
direct

02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
direct
 
02:26:23.110 --> 02:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
to any qualified candidate
 
02:26:25.429 --> 02:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
candidates would qualify to receive
 
02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
these certificates
 
02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
by collecting lots of small donations
 
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
from in-state voters
 
02:26:34.710 --> 02:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
a candidate for the governorship would
 
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
have to collect twenty five hundred
 
02:26:39.510 --> 02:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
five dollar donations ninety percent of
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
which would need to come from
 
02:26:43.590 --> 02:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:44.790 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
residents

02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
residents
 
02:26:46.710 --> 02:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
in order to qualify
 
02:26:50.150 --> 02:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
for these voter dollars
 
02:26:52.469 --> 02:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
this system
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
would give candidates a very strong
 
02:26:57.110 --> 02:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
incentive to focus
 
02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
all of their attention
 
02:27:01.349 --> 02:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
on new hampshire voters
 
02:27:03.830 --> 02:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
and it would give candidates who do pay
 
02:27:06.630 --> 02:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
attention to new hampshire voters
 
02:27:08.469 --> 02:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
a real chance
 
02:27:10.469 --> 02:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
against those candidates who would
 
02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
rather court
 
02:27:15.429 --> 02:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
out of state big money
 
02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
creates a framework
 
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
for voluntary voter owned elections
 
02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
it would allocate one dollar
 
02:27:28.830 --> 02:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
toward this
 
02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:30.389 align:start position:0%
toward this
fund

02:27:30.389 --> 02:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:27:32.550 --> 02:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
in order to create a line in the budget
 
02:27:34.710 --> 02:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
for it future legislation would be
 
02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:36.150 align:start position:0%
for it future legislation would be
necessary

02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
to fully fund
 
02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
this system
 
02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is about endorsing the concept
 
02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
and it would cost one dollar
 
02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
to the state of new hampshire to do so
 
02:27:50.950 --> 02:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
legislation like this a system like this
 
02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
has been working
 
02:27:54.230 --> 02:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
in maine
 
02:27:56.950 --> 02:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
since 1996
 
02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
and that system has the support
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
of people on the left and the right
 
02:28:05.190 --> 02:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
democrats and republicans admire it and
 
02:28:09.510 --> 02:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:12.630 --> 02:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
some say that this system would be too
 
02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:14.790 align:start position:0%
some say that this system would be too
expensive

02:28:14.790 --> 02:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
but it's a lot less expensive
 
02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
than the perception of corruption
 
02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
that causes citizens in large numbers
 
02:28:25.270 --> 02:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
especially young citizens
 
02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
to lose their faith in constitutional
 
02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.550 align:start position:0%
to lose their faith in constitutional
democracy

02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
02:28:36.309 --> 02:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:38.070 --> 02:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
the house will be in order
 
02:28:39.590 --> 02:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
member from rochester representative
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
groan is recognized speak in support of
 
02:28:43.030 --> 02:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
the committee report
 
02:28:45.510 --> 02:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:28:49.429 --> 02:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
hb 1423 provides a mechanism for
 
02:28:52.389 --> 02:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funding of one million dollars
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
for candidates for governor and sixty
 
02:28:56.790 --> 02:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for candidates for
 
02:28:59.349 --> 02:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
i might say here that though the bill
 
02:29:05.110 --> 02:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
currently provides a one dollar
 
02:29:06.790 --> 02:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
initial budget
 
02:29:09.590 --> 02:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
if one candidate took the million
 
02:29:11.429 --> 02:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
dollars that will be offered under this
 
02:29:13.830 --> 02:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
bill i would suggest that it would go
 
02:29:16.630 --> 02:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
considerably further over budget than we
 
02:29:21.429 --> 02:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:23.429 --> 02:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
the majority of the election law
 
02:29:25.590 --> 02:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
committee believes that candidates who
 
02:29:27.590 --> 02:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
wish to represent citizens of new
 
02:29:30.070 --> 02:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire in their government should not
 
02:29:32.550 --> 02:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
have their campaign funded by the
 
02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
government they wish to serve in that's
 
02:29:37.510 --> 02:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
an inherent conflict of interest
 
02:29:39.830 --> 02:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
campaign financing has long been a
 
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
controversial issue
 
02:29:44.070 --> 02:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
at both state and federal level
 
02:29:46.630 --> 02:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
legislatures and the courts have spoken
 
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
on this issue over time and have
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
produced transparency for and limits to
 
02:29:53.429 --> 02:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
political contributions
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
transparency is provided by detailed
 
02:29:57.510 --> 02:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
reporting that is required of all
 
02:30:00.550 --> 02:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
political candidates and pacs
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
we can from our existing laws determine
 
02:30:05.670 --> 02:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
where political money comes from and to
 
02:30:08.309 --> 02:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
whom it is contributed our laws also
 
02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
provide limits to the amount of each
 
02:30:13.349 --> 02:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
contribution that can be received by a
 
02:30:17.110 --> 02:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
candidate for office in new hampshire
 
02:30:19.270 --> 02:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
the majority of this committee believes
 
02:30:21.990 --> 02:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is unnecessary and would not
 
02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
result in cleaner election funding i
 
02:30:26.790 --> 02:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
might add here that
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
02:30:31.110 --> 02:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
an assumption in this
 
02:30:31.120 --> 02:30:32.870 align:start position:0%
an assumption in this
legislation

02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:30:34.950 --> 02:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
that government money
 
02:30:36.309 --> 02:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
is cleaner
 
02:30:39.510 --> 02:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
than private money an assumption i don't
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
believe i agree with
 
02:30:45.030 --> 02:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
i urge you to support the itl motion
 
02:30:47.190 --> 02:30:47.200 align:start position:0%

02:30:49.030 --> 02:30:49.040 align:start position:0%

constitutional democracy are we a
 
02:31:07.270 --> 02:31:07.280 align:start position:0%

speaker
 
02:33:15.510 --> 02:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know recent polls of new
 
02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire voters
 
02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
show 80 percent
 
02:33:21.910 --> 02:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
believe big money and special interest
 
02:33:24.150 --> 02:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
have more influence on new hampshire
 
02:33:26.710 --> 02:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
politics than voters do
 
02:33:29.830 --> 02:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
and that two-thirds support some public
 
02:33:32.710 --> 02:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
funding of campaigns so that their
 
02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
voices can be heard more loudly
 
02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
and if i know this bill is the result of
 
02:33:43.590 --> 02:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
a 2018 public financing working group
 
02:33:47.190 --> 02:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
made up of six legislators two senators
 
02:33:49.110 --> 02:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
four representatives i don't know how
 
02:33:51.590 --> 02:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
they got the two senators but they did
 
02:33:54.870 --> 02:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
half democrats and half republicans
 
02:33:58.230 --> 02:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
including present and past chairs of the
 
02:34:00.469 --> 02:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
election law committees
 
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
after more than 20 years of study
 
02:34:06.389 --> 02:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
and if i know that participation in the
 
02:34:09.190 --> 02:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
public funding program is entirely

02:49:07.349 --> 02:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
of putting infrastructure key

a corporate governance structure
 
02:49:16.070 --> 02:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
it also requires risk mitigation
 
02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:17.110 align:start position:0%
it also requires risk mitigation
planning

02:49:17.110 --> 02:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
planning
 
02:49:19.110 --> 02:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
in the name of a privacy impact
 
02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:20.230 align:start position:0%
in the name of a privacy impact
assessment

02:49:20.230 --> 02:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:49:23.590 --> 02:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
establishes a couple of new positions
 
02:49:28.070 --> 02:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
with specific skills to investigating
 
02:49:30.710 --> 02:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
privacy issues and i.t security issues
 
02:49:31.990 --> 02:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
to come up with mitigation
 
02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:33.670 align:start position:0%
to come up with mitigation
recommendations

02:49:33.670 --> 02:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:34.630 align:start position:0%
recommendations
so

02:49:34.630 --> 02:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:49:36.870 --> 02:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
all together i
 
02:49:40.469 --> 02:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
think that this bill is the next logical
 
02:49:42.630 --> 02:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
step in the progression of protecting
 
02:49:44.710 --> 02:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
our citizens privacy
 
02:49:46.309 --> 02:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
and those
 
02:49:46.319 --> 02:49:47.510 align:start position:0%
and those
that

02:49:47.510 --> 02:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:49:49.349 --> 02:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
came to me before the hearing and said
 
02:49:51.590 --> 02:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
they had to oppose it i think were
 
02:49:54.070 --> 02:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
principled individuals i didn't hear
 
02:49:56.710 --> 02:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
myself disagreeing with our principles i
 
02:49:59.429 --> 02:49:59.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't saying no i was saying not yet
 
02:50:01.670 --> 02:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
because there's still time
 
02:50:04.389 --> 02:50:04.399 align:start position:0%
in either this session to hear bills on
 
02:50:07.830 --> 02:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
the topics of opt-in opt-out for future
 
02:50:09.910 --> 02:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
years if if we don't find that the
 
02:50:12.230 --> 02:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
department is complying with these uh
 
02:50:14.150 --> 02:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
privacy requirements
 
02:50:14.160 --> 02:50:15.030 align:start position:0%
privacy requirements
so

02:50:15.030 --> 02:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:50:17.030 --> 02:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
so with that i would ask
 
02:50:18.710 --> 02:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
for an affirmative vote on this i don't
 
02:50:20.830 --> 02:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
believe there's anyone speaking in
 
02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:22.389 align:start position:0%
believe there's anyone speaking in
opposition

02:50:22.389 --> 02:50:22.399 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
02:50:25.269 --> 02:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
and i'd be perfectly happy with the
 
02:50:25.279 --> 02:50:27.269 align:start position:0%
and i'd be perfectly happy with the
vote

02:50:27.269 --> 02:50:27.279 align:start position:0%

02:52:09.510 --> 02:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
will not accomplish what the bill's
 
02:52:11.429 --> 02:52:11.439 align:start position:0%
title suggests it will
 
02:52:13.030 --> 02:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
that is to make voter checklists
 
02:52:14.870 --> 02:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
available in spreadsheet form to any
 
02:52:17.190 --> 02:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
resident who requests it
 
02:52:19.110 --> 02:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
current law says that the supervisors of

the checklist or city or town clerk
 
02:52:24.469 --> 02:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
may provide the checklist in any form
 
02:52:26.950 --> 02:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
the format chosen is at the discretion
 
02:52:28.710 --> 02:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
of the supervisors of the checklist or
 
02:52:30.230 --> 02:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
the clerk

the amended bill states that the

supervisors of the checklist or clerk
 
02:52:36.389 --> 02:52:36.399 align:start position:0%

electronic copy
 
02:52:40.790 --> 02:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
again the format chosen is still at the

discretion of the supervisors of the
 
02:52:44.550 --> 02:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
checklist or the clerk
 
02:52:46.070 --> 02:52:46.080 align:start position:0%

the amendment states that electronic

02:52:55.990 --> 02:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
within the last 31 days
 
02:52:57.750 --> 02:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
but the supervisors of the checklist
 
02:53:00.070 --> 02:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
don't meet every month in fact most of
 
02:53:02.070 --> 02:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
them just meet prior to elections to

02:53:11.910 --> 02:53:11.920 align:start position:0%

02:53:15.670 --> 02:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
concerns were raised that the

to any resident upon request
 
02:53:23.269 --> 02:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
would intrude upon our citizens right to

would intrude upon our citizens right to

anyone can go to the city or town

business hours
 
02:53:33.830 --> 02:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
but once a spreadsheet containing the
 
02:53:35.990 --> 02:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
names and addresses of voters is
 
02:53:37.590 --> 02:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
released to anyone
 
02:53:39.349 --> 02:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
that information can be sorted

databases
 
02:53:44.309 --> 02:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
so that the mailing addresses can be
 
02:53:47.030 --> 02:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
used for commercial or other purposes
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
current law says the checklist can't be
 
02:53:51.110 --> 02:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
used for commercial purposes
 
02:53:52.790 --> 02:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
but how would that be controlled if this
 
02:53:54.710 --> 02:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
bill passes
 
02:53:56.389 --> 02:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
the bill as amended is flawed and won't
 
02:53:57.990 --> 02:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
accomplish what it was intended to
 
02:53:58.000 --> 02:53:59.030 align:start position:0%
accomplish what it was intended to
accomplish

02:53:59.030 --> 02:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
02:54:00.550 --> 02:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
we should not have passed a bill with an
 
02:54:02.309 --> 02:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
expectation that the senate will fix our
 
02:54:02.319 --> 02:54:03.510 align:start position:0%
expectation that the senate will fix our
mistakes

02:54:03.510 --> 02:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
mistakes
 
02:54:05.349 --> 02:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
the bill is poorly written
 
02:54:06.870 --> 02:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
and should be found in expedient to
 
02:54:06.880 --> 02:54:09.269 align:start position:0%
and should be found in expedient to
legislate

the ability for the average person to

in current law or in this bill that the

the committee report of the inexpedience

of legislate first let me give you a
 
03:05:01.830 --> 03:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of background information
 
03:05:03.830 --> 03:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
i was a firefighter for the city of
 
03:05:06.150 --> 03:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
nashville for 35 years
 
03:05:08.870 --> 03:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
i currently now serve as vice president
 
03:05:11.110 --> 03:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
on this uh board of aldermen and the
 
03:05:14.230 --> 03:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
city of nashua which gives me a fair
 
03:05:14.240 --> 03:05:15.670 align:start position:0%
city of nashua which gives me a fair
understanding

03:05:15.670 --> 03:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
03:05:19.750 --> 03:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
of what is actually happening here
 
03:05:22.230 --> 03:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
when we look at this particular bill we
 
03:05:24.950 --> 03:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
must remember when the state retirement
 
03:05:29.030 --> 03:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
system started in 1967
 
03:05:31.110 --> 03:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
a promise was made
 
03:05:33.349 --> 03:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
to entice the other all communities
 
03:05:34.870 --> 03:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
within the state
 
03:05:37.830 --> 03:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
to join into from four separate
 
03:05:40.870 --> 03:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh retirement plans into one
 
03:05:43.910 --> 03:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
and that the state would pay 40 percent
 
03:05:47.269 --> 03:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
in time that was negotiated down to 35
 
03:05:48.790 --> 03:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
and for decades
 
03:05:52.070 --> 03:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
it stayed at 35
 
03:05:55.030 --> 03:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
but in very recent times
 
03:05:57.190 --> 03:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
what has happened is
 
03:06:00.230 --> 03:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
that 35 percent
 
03:06:02.790 --> 03:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
was brought down to 30
 
03:06:05.110 --> 03:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
to 25
 
03:06:08.230 --> 03:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
in approximately 2011.
 
03:06:12.309 --> 03:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
so now the state pays zero
 
03:06:15.910 --> 03:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
now this liability that the cities and
 
03:06:18.630 --> 03:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
towns that you live in
 
03:06:20.550 --> 03:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
and if you have
 
03:06:22.710 --> 03:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
one teacher
 
03:06:24.630 --> 03:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
one police officer
 
03:06:27.670 --> 03:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
or one firefighters you are making up
 
03:06:29.269 --> 03:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
the difference
 
03:06:31.110 --> 03:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
now whether you make it up
 
03:06:33.349 --> 03:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh where does the money come from but
 
03:06:33.359 --> 03:06:34.630 align:start position:0%
uh where does the money come from but
basically

03:06:34.630 --> 03:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:06:36.309 --> 03:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
debt is going
 
03:06:39.590 --> 03:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh the state has paid nothing into the
 
03:06:43.590 --> 03:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
retirement system on that so therefore
 
03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
to me
 
03:06:46.469 --> 03:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
this is a true
 
03:06:49.990 --> 03:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
property tax bill the reason i rise
 
03:06:52.550 --> 03:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
against the itl
 
03:06:53.830 --> 03:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
is because
 
03:06:56.389 --> 03:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
citizens need property
 
03:06:58.630 --> 03:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
tax relief
 
03:07:00.710 --> 03:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
by you changing
 
03:07:03.110 --> 03:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
the committee's report of this
 
03:07:05.190 --> 03:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
you will be bringing
 
03:07:08.790 --> 03:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
some tax relief back to your community
 
03:07:11.670 --> 03:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
not at 35
 
03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
i'm easily 7.5
 
03:07:15.990 --> 03:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this bill that's
 
03:07:18.309 --> 03:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
going to say as we march on to the
 
03:07:21.190 --> 03:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
future and escalate but currently right
 
03:07:21.200 --> 03:07:22.830 align:start position:0%
future and escalate but currently right
now

03:07:22.830 --> 03:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:07:25.269 --> 03:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
7.5 percent
 
03:07:25.279 --> 03:07:26.389 align:start position:0%
7.5 percent
now

03:07:26.389 --> 03:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:07:28.710 --> 03:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
it may be presented to you that this was
 
03:07:31.429 --> 03:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
rolled back for the employees to make
 
03:07:33.750 --> 03:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
that make up the difference
 
03:07:36.230 --> 03:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
well when i started in the retirement
 
03:07:38.550 --> 03:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
system we paid nine and three quarters
 
03:07:38.560 --> 03:07:39.510 align:start position:0%
system we paid nine and three quarters
percent

03:07:39.510 --> 03:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:07:44.150 --> 03:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:47.030 --> 03:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
your employees are tapped out that is
 
03:07:49.269 --> 03:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
your employees in your community that
 
03:07:50.790 --> 03:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
are tied into the new hampshire
 
03:07:52.469 --> 03:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
03:07:52.479 --> 03:07:53.230 align:start position:0%
retirement system
have

03:07:53.230 --> 03:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:07:57.830 --> 03:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
2.13 percent less spending ability
 
03:08:00.389 --> 03:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
because of what the new hampshire return
 
03:08:02.469 --> 03:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
retirement system has done
 
03:08:06.630 --> 03:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
to meet that 11.8 day
 
03:08:08.710 --> 03:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
this bill here
 
03:08:10.950 --> 03:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the unfunded
 
03:08:10.960 --> 03:08:12.309 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the unfunded
liability

03:08:12.309 --> 03:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
liability
 
03:08:15.030 --> 03:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
i support the unfunded liability
 
03:08:17.990 --> 03:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
in order to make a pretty decent solid
 
03:08:19.590 --> 03:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
pension system
 
03:08:19.600 --> 03:08:20.630 align:start position:0%
pension system
again

03:08:20.630 --> 03:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:08:24.710 --> 03:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
this is just intending to be tax relief
 
03:08:27.990 --> 03:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
to the cities and towns that are making
 
03:08:31.990 --> 03:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
up to 35 percent deficit
 
03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:33.110 align:start position:0%
up to 35 percent deficit
now

03:08:33.110 --> 03:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:08:35.910 --> 03:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
where does that money come from it comes
 
03:08:38.950 --> 03:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
from the property tax
 
03:08:41.750 --> 03:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
money doesn't grow on trees
 
03:08:43.670 --> 03:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
so i ask you
 
03:08:45.990 --> 03:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
to override
 
03:08:49.110 --> 03:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
the committee's report of itl so that i
 
03:08:50.230 --> 03:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
can make
 
03:08:52.150 --> 03:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
another motion that would be more
 
03:08:54.870 --> 03:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate to assist
 
03:08:54.880 --> 03:08:56.150 align:start position:0%
appropriate to assist
every

03:08:56.150 --> 03:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
every
 
03:08:56.160 --> 03:08:57.269 align:start position:0%
every
single

03:08:57.269 --> 03:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
single
 
03:08:57.279 --> 03:08:59.110 align:start position:0%
single
municipality

03:08:59.110 --> 03:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
03:09:01.910 --> 03:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
city of town and political subdivisions
 
03:09:03.670 --> 03:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
that has one
 
03:09:03.680 --> 03:09:05.030 align:start position:0%
that has one
employee

03:09:05.030 --> 03:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
employee
 
03:09:07.110 --> 03:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire retirement system
 
03:09:09.030 --> 03:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:23.910 --> 03:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:27.030 --> 03:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
this is as the previous speaker
 
03:09:27.040 --> 03:09:28.150 align:start position:0%
this is as the previous speaker
mentioned

03:09:28.150 --> 03:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:09:32.389 --> 03:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
not a question of the unfunded liability
 
03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
except in so much as the only reason
 
03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
the contributions to the retirement
 
03:09:41.750 --> 03:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
system are so high is because we're
 
03:09:44.870 --> 03:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
still paying off 20 years
 
03:09:47.349 --> 03:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
of severe underfunding starting in the
 
03:09:49.030 --> 03:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
early 90s
 
03:09:51.269 --> 03:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
if we were only paying
 
03:09:53.670 --> 03:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
the cost of the pensions earned at the
 
03:09:53.680 --> 03:09:55.269 align:start position:0%
the cost of the pensions earned at the
moment

03:09:55.269 --> 03:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
moment
 
03:09:56.830 --> 03:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
nobody would
 
03:10:00.070 --> 03:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
care but as it is the towns took
 
03:10:02.070 --> 03:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
advantage of the
 
03:10:04.309 --> 03:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
under funding for 20 for
 
03:10:06.710 --> 03:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
almost 20 years
 
03:10:08.389 --> 03:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
and at
 
03:10:10.790 --> 03:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
for the last 10 years the state has
 
03:10:14.469 --> 03:10:14.479 align:start position:0%
declined to pay toward their share
 
03:10:15.790 --> 03:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
toward the
 
03:10:22.469 --> 03:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:24.630 --> 03:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
the one of the main reasons that the
 
03:10:27.349 --> 03:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
state chose not to do so
 
03:10:30.150 --> 03:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
is that every municipality
 
03:10:33.429 --> 03:10:33.439 align:start position:0%
has full control over how many employees
 
03:10:35.990 --> 03:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
they have and what they're paid
 
03:10:39.670 --> 03:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
so that a town that has
 
03:10:42.630 --> 03:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
six police officers like mine
 
03:10:42.640 --> 03:10:43.670 align:start position:0%
six police officers like mine
pays

03:10:43.670 --> 03:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
pays
 
03:10:47.429 --> 03:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
the same percentage as a town that a
 
03:10:50.870 --> 03:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
similar size that has 10 police officers
 
03:10:52.830 --> 03:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
we still pay the same
 
03:10:56.150 --> 03:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
percentage but if we were to contribute
 
03:10:57.670 --> 03:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
to the cost
 
03:11:00.790 --> 03:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
of the municipalities that spend more
 
03:11:02.229 --> 03:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
than others
 
03:11:03.349 --> 03:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
we would be
 
03:11:04.950 --> 03:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
charging the
 
03:11:08.150 --> 03:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
businesses and people in this in the
 
03:11:11.030 --> 03:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
more thrifty towns to pay for the towns
 
03:11:13.510 --> 03:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
that pay more
 
03:11:14.630 --> 03:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
03:11:16.950 --> 03:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
that that's not fair
 
03:11:19.110 --> 03:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
and i have to say that the reason that
 
03:11:19.120 --> 03:11:20.070 align:start position:0%
and i have to say that the reason that
the

03:11:20.070 --> 03:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:11:23.349 --> 03:11:23.359 align:start position:0%
towns are
 
03:11:25.990 --> 03:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
didn't notice that the the employees
 
03:11:27.269 --> 03:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
were paying
 
03:11:29.190 --> 03:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
what had previously been the state
 
03:11:31.990 --> 03:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
shares that when it was implemented
 
03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
there were a large number of other
 
03:11:37.030 --> 03:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
increases due to other unrelated changes
 
03:11:39.030 --> 03:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
to the pension system
 
03:11:40.070 --> 03:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:11:42.229 --> 03:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
they have
 
03:11:45.190 --> 03:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
insisted that their
 
03:11:47.030 --> 03:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
they just got cheated
 
03:11:47.040 --> 03:11:48.150 align:start position:0%
they just got cheated
and

03:11:48.150 --> 03:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:50.550 --> 03:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
that is not factual but
 
03:11:52.229 --> 03:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
that's what they believe and they have
 
03:11:55.269 --> 03:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
been trying for the last 10 years
 
03:11:57.429 --> 03:11:57.439 align:start position:0%
11 act almost
 
03:11:59.910 --> 03:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
to have the state take over part of
 
03:12:02.710 --> 03:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
their responsibility
 
03:12:05.269 --> 03:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
i think that we should continue to let
 
03:12:05.279 --> 03:12:05.990 align:start position:0%
i think that we should continue to let
the

03:12:05.990 --> 03:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:07.150 align:start position:0%
the
the

03:12:07.150 --> 03:12:07.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:12:09.990 --> 03:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities decide how many employees
 
03:12:11.670 --> 03:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
and what they're paid
 
03:12:13.750 --> 03:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
and include the cost of the retirement
 
03:12:17.269 --> 03:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
system as part of the employee benefits
 
03:12:20.150 --> 03:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank please vote green
 
03:12:23.590 --> 03:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:26.070 --> 03:12:26.080 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
03:14:35.030 --> 03:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative tony
 
03:14:37.269 --> 03:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
lakers for a parliamentary inquiry thank
 
03:14:39.030 --> 03:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
you mr speaker
 
03:14:41.349 --> 03:14:41.359 align:start position:0%
if i know that cities towns and schools
 
03:14:43.750 --> 03:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
determine how many employees they hire
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
and what they're paid and therefore to a
 
03:14:48.309 --> 03:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
large extent determine pension costs
 
03:14:50.229 --> 03:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
and if i know that given that if the
 
03:14:51.910 --> 03:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
state were to pay a portion of the
 
03:14:53.910 --> 03:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
pension costs the state should have
 
03:14:55.990 --> 03:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
control of the number of employees and
 
03:14:57.830 --> 03:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
their pay
 
03:14:59.990 --> 03:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
and further if i know that when the
 
03:15:02.229 --> 03:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
state stopped paying part of the pension
 
03:15:04.710 --> 03:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
costs that cost was
 
03:15:07.510 --> 03:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
shifted to employees not the city's
 
03:15:10.630 --> 03:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
towns and schools and therefore had no
 
03:15:13.269 --> 03:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
impact on property taxes
 
03:15:14.790 --> 03:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
would i press the green button to
 
03:15:16.950 --> 03:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
support the committee recommendation of
 
03:15:20.950 --> 03:15:20.960 align:start position:0%

03:30:32.469 --> 03:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien for a

thank you mr speaker

mr speaker if you know i don't want to
 
03:30:41.670 --> 03:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
continue to bore you with pis
 
03:30:47.190 --> 03:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
but in particular just to rehash briefly
 
03:30:49.830 --> 03:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
that this is a true property tax bill
 
03:30:52.630 --> 03:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
that will help out our cities and towns
 
03:30:55.910 --> 03:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
who have employees in the new hampshire
 
03:30:58.870 --> 03:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
retirement system and if you believe
 
03:31:01.269 --> 03:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
that every single taxpayer could use a
 
03:31:04.389 --> 03:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
break at this particular time and if you
 
03:31:06.469 --> 03:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
also believe that municipalities could
 
03:31:07.910 --> 03:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
use this break
 
03:31:10.710 --> 03:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
then would you vote with me
 
03:31:12.950 --> 03:31:12.960 align:start position:0%

the last 10 years
 
03:31:41.990 --> 03:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:31:44.309 --> 03:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
we are not bound by the decisions of
 
03:31:47.429 --> 03:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
previous legislators whether to share in
 
03:31:50.710 --> 03:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
the cost of their employees or not
 
03:31:53.510 --> 03:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
and if i know that their decisions on
 
03:31:56.070 --> 03:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
hiring and pay are what determines how
 
03:31:58.070 --> 03:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
much they pay toward the retirement

say about dawn
 
03:47:47.510 --> 03:47:47.520 align:start position:0%

committee
 
03:47:56.469 --> 03:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
he was a quiet
 
03:47:58.550 --> 03:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
self-contained man
 
03:48:01.750 --> 03:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
but quietly interesting
 
03:48:03.910 --> 03:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
as had been the case through my tenure
 
03:48:05.349 --> 03:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
in the house
 
03:48:09.189 --> 03:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
that committee left politics at the door
 
03:48:11.910 --> 03:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
and looked at issues and how they could
 
03:48:16.309 --> 03:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
have a positive or negative effect on
 
03:48:18.870 --> 03:48:18.880 align:start position:0%

towns
 
03:48:25.910 --> 03:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
we pretty much approached most issues
 
03:48:28.870 --> 03:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
with the same point of view
 
03:48:31.830 --> 03:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
don was a fine public servant
 
03:48:35.349 --> 03:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
who did not succumb to partisanship
 
03:48:38.630 --> 03:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
and i do not remember him being absent
 
03:48:42.150 --> 03:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
more than one or two days in the time i
 
03:48:45.510 --> 03:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
sat on that committee with him
 
03:48:48.469 --> 03:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
when we disagreed on an issue
 
03:48:50.550 --> 03:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
we'd argue a point
 
03:48:53.189 --> 03:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
but never let that disagreement
 
03:48:56.389 --> 03:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
interfere with being cordial
 
03:48:58.150 --> 03:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
he enjoyed his work
 
03:49:00.309 --> 03:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
and did a great job
 
03:49:02.630 --> 03:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
we both took great delight

the honorable dave babson related an
 
03:49:16.950 --> 03:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
interesting story about dawn
 
03:49:18.950 --> 03:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
there was a discussion
 
03:49:21.590 --> 03:49:21.600 align:start position:0%

mr hansen
 
03:49:59.030 --> 03:49:59.040 align:start position:0%

don also spent 22 years in the air force

and as an aside
 
03:50:30.389 --> 03:50:30.399 align:start position:0%
you don't get to work on air force one
 
03:50:32.790 --> 03:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
unless you are among the lead of the air

evening honorable colleagues
 
03:52:49.830 --> 03:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday marked 10 years since i was
 
03:52:52.950 --> 03:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer
 
03:52:54.309 --> 03:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
now i'm thankful for the fact that
 
03:52:56.550 --> 03:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
cancer made me into the man i am today
 
03:52:58.469 --> 03:52:58.479 align:start position:0%
and has made me appreciate every day of
 
03:52:59.590 --> 03:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
my life
 
03:53:01.349 --> 03:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
and to see the positives in every
 
03:53:01.359 --> 03:53:03.110 align:start position:0%
and to see the positives in every
situation

03:53:03.110 --> 03:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
situation
 
03:53:05.110 --> 03:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
i distinctly remember that having cancer
 
03:53:06.309 --> 03:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
and dealing with the american health
 
03:53:08.550 --> 03:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
care system is what led me to political
 
03:53:08.560 --> 03:53:09.910 align:start position:0%
care system is what led me to political
activism

03:53:09.910 --> 03:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
activism
 
03:53:11.670 --> 03:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
the hospital for which i received care
 
03:53:14.469 --> 03:53:14.479 align:start position:0%
was charging my insurance forty dollars
 
03:53:17.030 --> 03:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
for a single tylenol
 
03:53:19.910 --> 03:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
that meant for a guy my size i need two
 
03:53:21.349 --> 03:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
so that's eighty dollars for a single
 
03:53:21.359 --> 03:53:22.630 align:start position:0%
so that's eighty dollars for a single
dose

03:53:22.630 --> 03:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
dose
 
03:53:24.389 --> 03:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
that means that during my seven day
 
03:53:27.110 --> 03:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
hospitalization the hospital made over
 
03:53:29.189 --> 03:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
one thousand five hundred dollars in
 
03:53:32.150 --> 03:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
pure profit on tylenol alone
 
03:53:33.910 --> 03:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
while the bottle of tylenol across the
 
03:53:37.510 --> 03:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
street at cvs costed or costed it cost
 
03:53:40.469 --> 03:53:40.479 align:start position:0%
6.99 at the time
 
03:53:42.389 --> 03:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
dealing with cancer was already hard but
 
03:53:43.910 --> 03:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
knowing that somebody was making money
 
03:53:46.229 --> 03:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
off of my suffering was kicking me while
 
03:53:47.670 --> 03:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
i was down
 
03:53:49.189 --> 03:53:49.199 align:start position:0%

profiting off my suffering
 
03:53:53.429 --> 03:53:53.439 align:start position:0%
