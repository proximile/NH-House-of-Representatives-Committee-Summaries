00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:16.309 align:start position:0%
broader sense
you're<00:07:14.560><c> right</c><00:07:14.880><c> i</c><00:07:15.039><c> mean</c><00:07:15.440><c> a</c><00:07:15.520><c> lot</c><00:07:15.680><c> of</c><00:07:15.840><c> power</c><00:07:16.160><c> can</c>

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
you're right i mean a lot of power can
 

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:18.070 align:start position:0%
you're right i mean a lot of power can
be<00:07:16.560><c> accumulated</c><00:07:17.199><c> in</c><00:07:17.280><c> the</c><00:07:17.360><c> hands</c><00:07:17.599><c> of</c><00:07:17.759><c> a</c><00:07:17.840><c> board</c>

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
be accumulated in the hands of a board
 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.830 align:start position:0%
be accumulated in the hands of a board
whether<00:07:18.319><c> or</c><00:07:18.400><c> not</c><00:07:18.560><c> it</c><00:07:18.639><c> comes</c><00:07:18.880><c> under</c><00:07:19.120><c> oplc</c><00:07:19.759><c> or</c>

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not it comes under oplc or
 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.629 align:start position:0%
whether or not it comes under oplc or
not

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
not
 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:23.189 align:start position:0%
not
the<00:07:20.800><c> difference</c><00:07:21.199><c> is</c><00:07:21.360><c> is</c><00:07:21.520><c> that</c><00:07:22.160><c> under</c><00:07:22.479><c> oplc</c><00:07:23.039><c> it</c>

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
the difference is is that under oplc it
 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:26.230 align:start position:0%
the difference is is that under oplc it
now<00:07:23.360><c> brings</c><00:07:23.599><c> the</c><00:07:23.680><c> force</c><00:07:24.000><c> of</c><00:07:24.160><c> law</c><00:07:24.560><c> of</c><00:07:24.720><c> the</c><00:07:24.880><c> state</c>

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
now brings the force of law of the state
 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.469 align:start position:0%
now brings the force of law of the state
uh<00:07:26.479><c> so</c><00:07:26.800><c> the</c><00:07:26.960><c> board</c><00:07:27.199><c> had</c><00:07:27.440><c> the</c><00:07:27.680><c> force</c><00:07:27.919><c> of</c><00:07:28.080><c> the</c><00:07:28.160><c> law</c>

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
uh so the board had the force of the law
 

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:31.270 align:start position:0%
uh so the board had the force of the law
for<00:07:28.639><c> its</c><00:07:28.880><c> rules</c>

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.550 align:start position:0%

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
any rules that it may have have
 

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:37.270 align:start position:0%
any rules that it may have have
generated<00:07:35.599><c> the</c><00:07:35.840><c> problem</c><00:07:36.240><c> is</c><00:07:36.479><c> that</c><00:07:36.800><c> that</c><00:07:37.039><c> some</c>

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
generated the problem is that that some
 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.870 align:start position:0%
generated the problem is that that some
of<00:07:37.360><c> the</c><00:07:37.440><c> boards</c><00:07:37.840><c> didn't</c><00:07:38.240><c> actually</c><00:07:38.639><c> write</c>

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
of the boards didn't actually write
 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.990 align:start position:0%
of the boards didn't actually write
rules

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.909 align:start position:0%
 
right<00:07:42.479><c> yeah</c><00:07:42.639><c> these</c><00:07:42.880><c> these</c><00:07:43.120><c> boards</c><00:07:43.360><c> were</c><00:07:43.680><c> were</c>

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
right yeah these these boards were were
 

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:45.029 align:start position:0%
right yeah these these boards were were
not

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
not
 

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:47.830 align:start position:0%
not
they<00:07:45.360><c> were</c><00:07:45.919><c> statutory</c><00:07:46.639><c> boards</c>

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
they were statutory boards
 

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.869 align:start position:0%
they were statutory boards
so

00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:51.110 align:start position:0%
so
again<00:07:49.199><c> that's</c>

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
again that's
 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.670 align:start position:0%
again that's
i<00:07:51.280><c> think</c><00:07:52.000><c> the</c><00:07:52.240><c> uh</c>

that are not actually in the rule but
they

they
 

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.789 align:start position:0%
they

understand are important to them and
 

00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:43.909 align:start position:0%
understand are important to them and
therefore<00:24:41.200><c> they</c><00:24:41.440><c> should</c><00:24:41.679><c> get</c><00:24:41.919><c> into</c><00:24:42.159><c> the</c><00:24:42.240><c> world</c>

00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
therefore they should get into the world
 

00:24:43.919 --> 00:24:45.590 align:start position:0%
therefore they should get into the world
yeah<00:24:44.159><c> i</c><00:24:44.400><c> would</c><00:24:44.559><c> say</c><00:24:44.960><c> you</c><00:24:45.039><c> know</c><00:24:45.200><c> one</c><00:24:45.360><c> of</c><00:24:45.440><c> my</c>
