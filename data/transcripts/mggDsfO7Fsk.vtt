so

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
come up to the mic if you don't mind
 
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
this is being recorded so
 
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
push make it red
 
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
there's a button nope down the bottom
 
00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.310 align:start position:0%
there you go
sorry

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh the things that you left in
 
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
this i'm morgan gaines i'm the president
 
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire midwife association
 
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
fantastic um
 
00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 align:start position:0%
the things that you left in the
 
00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
profession the midwifery profession like
 
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
is it still an advisory sort of
 
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
situation so we the oplc will
 
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.270 align:start position:0%
situation so we the oplc will
be

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
reaching out for
 
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
sort of like consult with the midwifery
 
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
council but still making the ultimate
 
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
decision there as far as like
 
00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
medications and devices
 
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
scope of practice those sorts of things
 
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
and then is it ultimately still
 
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
the executive director's decision
 
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.389 align:start position:0%
the executive director's decision
if

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:59.590 align:start position:0%
if
the

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
as i understand the changes we're making
 
00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
the idea is that the
 
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
executive director will make sure there
 
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
are rules regarding that
 
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.590 align:start position:0%
are rules regarding that
but

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
your organization and that with the
 
00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
represented by the advisory board will
 
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
be making the technical decisions on the
 
00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
scope of practice
 
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
and things like that
 
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
free counsel makes those actual those
 
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
decisions not the oplc
 
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
or together
 
00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
together the oplc will probably be
 
00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 align:start position:0%
nagging you to make sure you get them in
 
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
on time okay
 
00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.270 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
allegro

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
allegro
 
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
morning everybody
 
00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
i have to say that this this is a
 
00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 align:start position:0%
broader um
 
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
view of this bill
 
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
and this was a turning point for me
 
00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
because that move to try to form a board
 
00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
with no midwives
 
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
on it
 
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
really opens my eyes and makes me very
 
00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 align:start position:0%
concerned about the motivations
 
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor
 
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that's okay well you can ask her
 
00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
that's okay no it's not your motivation
 
00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.389 align:start position:0%
that's okay no it's not your motivation
specifically

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's just the whole motivation of oplc
 
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
when i first came on board here i
 
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.110 align:start position:0%
when i first came on board here i
understood

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
understood
 
00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 align:start position:0%
what i thought was the purpose of oplc
 
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
but i'm becoming more and more reticent
 
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
to put more power into the hands of an
 
00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 align:start position:0%
executive agency once again
 
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
right these guys they make the rules
 
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
they decide if the rule may have been
 
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
broken whether or not to initiate an
 
00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 align:start position:0%
investigation they conduct the
 
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
investigation they render the verdict
 
00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
they dictate the punitive actions
 
00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.110 align:start position:0%
they dictate the punitive actions
and

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
this is the same thing with a lot of
 
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
federal agencies
 
00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
and i just really am hesitant about
 
00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 align:start position:0%
putting more power into the hands
 
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
of oplc i'm going to be thinking about
 
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.869 align:start position:0%
of oplc i'm going to be thinking about
that

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
every bill going forward
 
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
and this one i just i just don't
 
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
understand honestly so i understand the
 
00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 align:start position:0%
intentions are good but i think our way
 
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
may be a little errant
 
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
so the you know as as we've
 
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
as we've talked about the the the
 
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
purpose of the creation of oplc
 
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
was very specific and i don't
 
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
i personally don't want to create an
 
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
empire that that is that is not the
 
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
intent the intent of the creation of
 
00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 align:start position:0%
oplc was to
 
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
remove a tremendous amount of duplicated
 
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
functions in confusion frankly because
 
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
we had folks that cross professions
 
00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
and there was no consistency to anything
 
00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.509 align:start position:0%
and there was no consistency to anything
so

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
again that's why you know going through
 
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
this there's certain administrative
 
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
things that that
 
00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 align:start position:0%
seem to make sense with them
 
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
but on the flip side
 
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
of of giving too much to oplc the
 
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.070 align:start position:0%
of of giving too much to oplc the
alternative

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
what we've had is that we've had these
 
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
boards that have had tremendous power as
 
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.110 align:start position:0%
boards that have had tremendous power as
well

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
and how do we
 
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
balance that i guess is probably
 
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
because the same thing is that you know
 
00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
whether it's the office of professional
 
00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 align:start position:0%
licensure or the original board that was
 
00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:10.630 align:start position:0%
licensure or the original board that was
created

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
created
 
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.830 align:start position:0%
created
that

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
you're still instilling a limited amount
 
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
or a substantial amount of power to a
 
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's probably not relevant to the
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
current council
 
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
but 10 15 years ago when i first got
 
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.270 align:start position:0%
but 10 15 years ago when i first got
involved

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
the midwifery council was notorious for
 
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
having a director who kept all the
 
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
board's records in her back bedroom
 
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't share them
 
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
and it was a problem to get that solved
 
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
i believe it that has been solved
 
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.950 align:start position:0%
i believe it that has been solved
but

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
it's an example of what can happen when
 
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
you have a very small board
 
00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 align:start position:0%
and one person in charge who who ran it
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
like her own kingdom
 
00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.749 align:start position:0%
like her own kingdom
which

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
as i said it happened it happened you
 
00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
know 10 15 years ago
 
00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and like i say i'm i'm
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
just rethinking these things i'm not
 
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
rendering my own decision right now
 
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.550 align:start position:0%
rendering my own decision right now
um

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that that
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
clarification which i was aware of but
 
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
you you added some things
 
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
verbs of show it
 
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'll add to
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
what representative mcguire said also
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
regarding oplc
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
this agency
 
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.710 align:start position:0%
this agency
was

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
originally put in place
 
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
to run a few boards
 
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
and they ended up
 
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
an executive decision was made to try
 
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
and consolidate many boards under it to
 
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
ease the burden of the clerical work
 
00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 align:start position:0%
we did see
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
in the past that there seemed to be
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
a mindset of building empire there
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
i will say i don't i don't really see
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
that motivation
 
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
for the current leader but the
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
leadership changes and so that's what
 
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
we're trying to guard against
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
and yet still allow them to be able to
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
take over those administrative duties
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
and the clerical work
 
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
that the professions don't necessarily
 
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
need to be bothered with and to be more
 
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.270 align:start position:0%
need to be bothered with and to be more
efficient

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
and more efficient way to run state
 
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.830 align:start position:0%
and more efficient way to run state
government

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so this you know this is a broad
 
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
scope we're not really picking on
 
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
midwifery or any any specific group
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
because there's been examples of issues
 
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.430 align:start position:0%
because there's been examples of issues
in

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
multiple boards but that's why you know
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
going through the document here and
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
carving out what
 
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
rather than just dumping the whole thing
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
onto the oplc
 
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
saying okay there are some places where
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate for the professional
 
00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
board to retain
 
00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:55.510 align:start position:0%
board to retain
and

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean so it it's it keeps
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
the it's spreading the power out in
 
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
essence yeah um yeah and and i don't
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
want to draw too much
 
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
off the track from
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
the focus of this meeting which is the
 
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
details of this bill sure but um you
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
know the the
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
again just for the last time in the
 
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
broader sense
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
you're right i mean a lot of power can
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
be accumulated in the hands of a board
 
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not it comes under oplc or
 
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.629 align:start position:0%
whether or not it comes under oplc or
not

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
the difference is is that under oplc it
 
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
now brings the force of law of the state
 
00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
uh so the board had the force of the law
 
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.550 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
any rules that it may have have
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
generated the problem is that that some
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
of the boards didn't actually write
 
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.990 align:start position:0%
of the boards didn't actually write
rules

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
right yeah these these boards were were
 
00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:45.029 align:start position:0%
right yeah these these boards were were
not

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
they were statutory boards
 
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.869 align:start position:0%
they were statutory boards
so

00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
again that's
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
i think the uh
 
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
midwives have something that they want
 
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
to add to this
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sherry stevens i'm the chair of the
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
midwifery board
 
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.390 align:start position:0%
midwifery board
um

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
i could take a long time and talk to you
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
about the history of the board
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
and the history of the relationship with
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
oplc but that's not the purpose of this
 
00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:16.469 align:start position:0%
oplc but that's not the purpose of this
meeting

00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
i have been on the board since 2015
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
and since then we have been
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
desperately trying to work with oplc
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
trying to get things to go through
 
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
trying to get things organized
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
watching them go through their growing
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
pains and getting
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
you know even our licensure online
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
done which is still a little bit of a
 
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.870 align:start position:0%
done which is still a little bit of a
nightmare

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
nightmare
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
working through our investigations and
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
using all these different entities to
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
try to you know we're trying to be like
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
the purpose of you is to organize right
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
so you're you're going to organize our
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
our licensing process so that it's it's
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
much easier i've been doing it all
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
myself for years not because
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
i wanted to because there was nothing
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
else there to do and and i've reached
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
out to them
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
multiple times and saying you guys going
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
to take this over what do we need to do
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't until this last session
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
last fall that they finally took it over
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
and it was a nightmare it did not go
 
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
smoothly and it's not going to go
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
smoothly this spring because they
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
haven't got their software together and
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
so that's fine you know we're we as a
 
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.550 align:start position:0%
so that's fine you know we're we as a
board

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
aren't trying to
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
take over the
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
um administrative duties we're happy to
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
work with somebody but also the
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
frustration level of handing over
 
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know our ability to license our you
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
know constituents are not constituents
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
but you know the the midwives right they
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
they need their licensure and if they're
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
it goes overdue because of
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
administrative duties we lose medicaid
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
we lose med mao we lose our ability to
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
order medications
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
and that's what's happening so
 
00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:55.519 align:start position:0%
you know we really want this
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
organization to be organized and work
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
for us but taking it over
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
and and giving that power to somebody
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
doing it for the midwives they're doing
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
it across the board if they got that
 
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
together they got their rules together
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
and every board had their same way of
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
running a meeting every board had their
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
same way of licensing all that stuff was
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
happy we would be thrilled
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
but then what we see happening
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
is you're taking over midwifery at his
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
advisory board historically
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
has put midwifery out of business
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
there's other states that move midwifery
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
into an advisory board and it puts it in
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
a very vulnerable state because somebody
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
else can just decide nope we don't want
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
that anymore
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
and and it's gone even in vermont they
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
keep using vermont as a an example as an
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
advisory board they're very vulnerable
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
to whoever's in that position we would
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
be very vulnerable whoever is in that
 
00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:55.269 align:start position:0%
be very vulnerable whoever is in that
position

00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
of the executive director
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
and saying we want midwifery and they
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
don't and when you say oh we're not
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
trying to get rid of mid-referee
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's true right now that's true i i
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
totally um don't think that that's this
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
this um entity's
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
desire and i don't think is the
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
executive director's desire at all i
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
don't think this is an attack on
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
midwifery specifically right here and
 
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
now but broadly it most certainly is a
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
danger for us and having
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
the executive director be in complete
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
control over these things
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
they can decide
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
you know what we want to have our
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
licensure be three thousand dollars wipe
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
out every midwife in the state we want
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
there is a some talk about having
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
everybody have liability insurance wipe
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
out every midwife in the state that's
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
not you know you're not looking at how
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
this profession is working
 
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
and why it's working this way and why
 
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.550 align:start position:0%
and why it's working this way and why
it's

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
serving the women and the families of
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
the state the way it is there's a whole
 
00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.350 align:start position:0%
the state the way it is there's a whole
big

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
big
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
um issue
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
right with medicaid reimbursement all
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
that stuff and these smaller hospitals
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
are closing
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
there's midwives there's myself and a
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
midwife in littleton and that's the
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
whole north country you know families
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
are not and there's very few hospitals
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
up there so where are families going to
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
go they have to travel an hour an hour
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
and have to give their birth to their
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
babies the midwives can fill in those
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
spots it's a very important profession
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
and this bill takes that out of our
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
hands and puts it into an entity oplc
 
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.470 align:start position:0%
hands and puts it into an entity oplc
why

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
what's what's not working if there's
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
something not working we need to have
 
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.870 align:start position:0%
something not working we need to have
some

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
level of
 
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
protection for oplc getting sued or the
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
mid-reward getting sued let's work on
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
that let's figure that problem out
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
because that's probably across the board
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
on every board right that's not just
 
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.030 align:start position:0%
on every board right that's not just
midwifery

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
midwifery
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
that's not the intent oplc is not there
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
is some sort of a legal barrier that's
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
right that's what they're telling us
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
they're telling us we're a small board
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
we're at risk of getting sued that's why
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
they're doing this that's
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's the the reason they're telling
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
this to us so that's what they're
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
telling us then let's solve that problem
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
this doesn't solve that problem
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
what is the problem
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
if you have if we need to have
 
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
administrative stuff going on with our
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
licensing process we need to have um
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
rules being made we're working with that
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
process we are actively working you're
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
working with it but i don't think you
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
have the statutory authority to be doing
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
what you're doing right now that's
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
that's part of the problem we're not
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
doing anything on our own we're doing
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
everything with the lawyers at oplc
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
within a meeting but what i'm saying is
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
you know you just mentioned handing off
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
some of the administrative functions to
 
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.470 align:start position:0%
some of the administrative functions to
oplc

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
in the past few years
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
but where in statute has that been
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
oplc's responsibility to take that from
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
you we're not asking them to do it
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
they're telling us that with that that
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
that's what we have to do and we're
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
trying to comply with what they're
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
telling us we're not asking i'm confused
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
what you said then because you said that
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
you have worked in the past and trying
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
to get oplc to to
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
handle administrative things
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
but i don't know that statutorily you
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
oplc had the
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
was required to do that for you not
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
until this piece of legislation came
 
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.470 align:start position:0%
until this piece of legislation came
forward

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
i have been doing it
 
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
the council has been doing it
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
and every time we go to a meeting they
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
say you're not supposed to be doing that
 
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
we have a whole board over here so when
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
i get it for instance i got a new
 
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
licensure to come in right an
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
application come in
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
i usually vet it i usually call all the
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
references i call all the high schools i
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
make sure that the information is
 
00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:26.710 align:start position:0%
make sure that the information is
accurate

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
and then i
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
present it to the board the board votes
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
they look through it they vote on it and
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
is the midwifery council you're talking
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
about the same as the board yes sorry
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
okay fine that's part of my confusion
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry from the way you were
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
describing it it sounded as though we
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
were a separate entity no i'm sorry
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
that's board and counseling i couldn't
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
sort of mix them up so the last time we
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
had a new application come in
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
i i called the licensing part of oplc a
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
woman named sharon that we work with and
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
i said what do you want me to do with
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
this do you want to do this or do you
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
want me to do it she goes no do what you
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
normally do so i started calling and
 
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.949 align:start position:0%
normally do so i started calling and
vetting

00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
vetting
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
i got to the meeting and i said here's
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
what i did and the administrator of oplc
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
said absolutely not you're not supposed
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
to be doing that
 
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
i said since when
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
and they i checked it out and they said
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
nope and so they took it and they put it
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
into their
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
pool of of
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
um licensing
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
people right the licensing part of the
 
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.030 align:start position:0%
people right the licensing part of the
oplc

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
took it out of our hands
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
brought it back to us said it was all
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
vetted i said where's the where's the
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
vetting where's what you did and they
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
said nope don't have to do it it's not
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
in your law and that person got licensed
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
i don't understand how oplc could have
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
done that because they the authority for
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
them to handle the administrative part
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
of that is in this legislation that has
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
not passed yet i agree with you and i
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
was like okay and then a new one came in
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
we didn't even look at it they took it
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
they vetted it and i said where's the
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
vetting did you call
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
and vet this license and they said we
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
don't have to it's not in your rules
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
to call like to call the high school
 
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.430 align:start position:0%
to call like to call the high school
to

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
call anybody's references and i'm like
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
why would you even have to have that in
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
a rule that seems like an applications
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
that's just like basic administrative
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
duties right you check out on somebody's
 
00:16:24.959 --> 00:16:26.069 align:start position:0%
duties right you check out on somebody's
references

00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
references
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
they did not
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
and then in this you're look you're
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
going to get clarification of what is
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the office to be doing
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
and what is appropriate for your board
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
to be doing right but that's not what
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
this is this is the executive director
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
is taking it
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
completely out of our hands they're
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
running it
 
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.230 align:start position:0%
running it
and

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to change our it's
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's that would be great if if they were
 
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.990 align:start position:0%
it's that would be great if if they were
actually

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
doing that but they're not so you're
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
saying i didn't i as a council chair
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have given them
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
this application and let them do it i
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
don't know that that was if the rule if
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
the statute under the midwife council
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that was appropriate
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
then why am i being told by them that's
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
what i have to do
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know why so this is the entity
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
that we're going to then give all this
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
power to
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
this entity that is consistently not
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
being clear and honest with us
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
and and the licensing of the midwives in
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
the state are at stake and that's my
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
problem with giving all this to
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
this oplc
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
at this point in time if they could say
 
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.669 align:start position:0%
at this point in time if they could say
here's

00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
here's
 
00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:36.870 align:start position:0%
here's
our

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
licensing operation
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
and then we look at it we say okay that
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
works i mean we want it to be consistent
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
across all boards everybody does right
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
that makes perfect sense
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
organizationally every board having
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
their own method of doing this is a
 
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.430 align:start position:0%
their own method of doing this is a
nightmare

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
nightmare
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
so that's the point of getting them
 
00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.789 align:start position:0%
so that's the point of getting them
organized

00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
organized
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
but we as a board right now you're
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
taking that
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
and they're telling us you need to do
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
this you need to do that and it's not
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
into the best interest of the mid-rights
 
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.350 align:start position:0%
into the best interest of the mid-rights
currently

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
and this this
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
new taking our law and putting
 
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
everything into the executive director
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
and having her oh administratively
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
you're saying attached you're saying um
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
that she needs to what was the words um
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the with the board
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
on this part in this part that we are
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
experts on that's absolutely appropriate
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
if that has to go through we definitely
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
want those parts in there
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
but the overall broader spectrum of this
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
rule this law change
 
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
is against the intent of the original 3
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
26 d
 
00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:45.990 align:start position:0%
26 d
establishing

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
establishing
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
the midwifery board
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
the medical board has a medical board
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
the nursing board right and they're
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
going to continue to remain autonomous
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
but the other 54 boards are going to all
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
follow under
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
the administrative over
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
site of oplc that's why it was created
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
and we're in carving out one or two
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
specific boards for this
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
is not oversight and administrative is
 
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.470 align:start position:0%
is not oversight and administrative is
great

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
that's not the same as what this bill is
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
doing if they're doing their oversight
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
and they're doing their administrative
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
job we have no problem well that's again
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's why this this bill is going to be
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
amended and we plunked out
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
the the parts that are specific to the
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
that that's what that's the purpose of
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee meeting was to pull you
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
know what i'm saying but you know as far
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
as like disciplinary action
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
investigation subpoenaing
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
the the basic process of renewals all
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
that all that is appropriate to be done
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
under oplc
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
that's an administ that's just a purely
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
administrative function and that's not
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's not in
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
that that's across the board that's not
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
just specific to your profession so
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's what the purpose of this is to
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
take the things that are specific to the
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
profession and leave them with the board
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
to decide how their profession is run
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
but the rest of this as far as just the
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
processing of things that is why oplc
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
was created
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
well and i would have a lot of faith in
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
that if i could had seen even in
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
even last week that that worked for me
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
but again oplc
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's i just find it peculiar that you
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
have a relationship with oplc that is
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
not codified in law
 
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.190 align:start position:0%
not codified in law
it's

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
someone's jumping the gun here
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
so if i can if you want to touch on the
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
well it seems like the right times now
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
because because it seems like we're
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
having a bit of a oplc's jumping the gun
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
here a little bit before this has
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
actually been
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
there you go good morning
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
for the record joe shoemaker director of
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
licensing and board administration for
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative pearson just to clarify
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
so when the oplc was created
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
approximately six years ago
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
all administrative functions for all
 
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.710 align:start position:0%
all administrative functions for all
boards

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
were put in that original statute
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
so we have since the office was created
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
always have had the authority for all
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
administrative functions for the board
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense it was a blank just
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
a blanket statement of authority yes
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
and that's why we've spent the last
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
three or four years
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
cleaning up all this
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
all of the interconnected statutes that
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
touch on to that correct it i understand
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
there is some confusion um again as
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire just said um
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
because the
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
different statutes for the different 54
 
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.149 align:start position:0%
different statutes for the different 54
professions

00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
professions
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
were not changed or modified
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
but it's very clear if you go back
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
through record and you go to the oplc
 
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.270 align:start position:0%
through record and you go to the oplc
statute

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
all administrative functions for all
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
boards the authority was granted at that
 
00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.470 align:start position:0%
boards the authority was granted at that
time

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
that was not a smart way to do that well
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct with that statute
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
might have been better done at the time
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
but listening to the council i'm
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
concerned that they have
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
procedures for
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
processing applications that the oplc
 
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
is ignoring and i would hope that you
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
would take that to heart and
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
and fix that because things like
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
checking ref
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
in something like midwifery where
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
there is a large practical aspect
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to need to check references
 
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
and things like that and i hope that
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
that will be
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
i want to be careful here i'm certainly
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
not here to
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
throw stones and
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
throw people under the bus
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
there's a couple corrections that need
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
to be made
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
the records for the 38 midwives
 
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
up until approximately a year and a half
 
00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.230 align:start position:0%
up until approximately a year and a half
ago

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
were at somebody's house it wasn't 10
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
years ago and it's been a
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
concern for a long time
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
as we discussed earlier part of the
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
reason for this submission was there's
 
00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.110 align:start position:0%
reason for this submission was there's
been

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
many things done that
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's been legal concerns on
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
the reference to
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
checking references per se
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
you can't have
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
things done that aren't in rule or
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
statute so for instance if you've
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
checked a reference and you determine
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's not correct and you withhold
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
somebody's license and there's no law
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
or rule in place that says
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
reference checks and i'm using this as
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
an example
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
are to be done
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
that becomes a problem
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
so we've continued to
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
have concerns with investigations with
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
processes and that's why this has come
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
forward as it's come forward
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
and when will you be revising your rules
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
the rules are the responsibility of the
 
00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.590 align:start position:0%
the rules are the responsibility of the
board

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
we're here to assist the board with rule
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
making but again and i i don't want to
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
get into a
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
throwing stones but again but assuming
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
this bill passes
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to need to enter into rule
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
making on a number of areas and i'm
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
wondering when that will happen because
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
it sounds like there are
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
that the board is working under a set of
 
00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:33.269 align:start position:0%
that the board is working under a set of
state

00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
assumptions on how things should proceed
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
that are not actually in the rule but
 
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.470 align:start position:0%
that are not actually in the rule but
they

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
understand are important to them and
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
therefore they should get into the world
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i would say you know one of my
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
concerns in here is this this law if
 
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.110 align:start position:0%
concerns in here is this this law if
passed

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
passed
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
would take effect 60 days later as i
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
think most are aware
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
60 days to pass rules is is very
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
difficult i i would say to answer your
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
question representative mcguire we would
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
start immediately
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
on rules
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
but you know best case if all goes
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
really well with boards that only meet
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
once a month jail card that meets once a
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
month best cases we are
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
you know probably 90 days 120 days if if
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
yes but my experience is that once you
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
actually start into rulemaking people
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
understand that you're taking it
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
seriously enough absolutely and that's
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
why we would start immediately
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
right and and the other thing too is you
 
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:31.830 align:start position:0%
right and and the other thing too is you
know

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
these boards
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
the various boards
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
the scope the size the effect on
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
professions is all different and what i
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to see
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
is the smaller boards becoming the
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
stepchildren of the oplc
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
right i mean all all these boards need
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
to function
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
that again the purpose being to make
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
government flow better
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
in any time that we modify government
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
with that intention and it flows worse
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know we we have to stop and pause
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
and and look at what what happened right
 
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.190 align:start position:0%
and and look at what what happened right
so

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.870 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
we it seems to me that there is a
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
a clear communication problem right now
 
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.549 align:start position:0%
a clear communication problem right now
and

00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
i don't know if 1061 is going to force
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
i think it will force better
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
communication because there's some
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
things that are going to change
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
but i do i do understand your your
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
trepidation with 60 days that number can
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
be adjusted that's not sure that's not a
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
actually it shouldn't
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
because you
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
can't actually formally start rulemaking
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
until the bill passes
 
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.190 align:start position:0%
until the bill passes
right

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
yeah so we want it to start as soon as
 
00:26:47.279 --> 00:26:48.149 align:start position:0%
yeah so we want it to start as soon as
possible

00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:26:48.159 --> 00:26:49.029 align:start position:0%
possible
sure

00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
i guess the only other thing i would add
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
is i
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
you know i as as
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know board chair
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
stevens mentioned earlier
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
i i want to make sure it's it's pretty
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
clear this bill was created
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
and if if
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
passed as written as an advisory board
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
the authority
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
you know for ultimate decision making
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
would lie with the executive director
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
and that's where we mentioned earlier
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
director courtney submitted a uh
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
amendment uh
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
that i have here in front of me that
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
that certainly adds in every place
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
but it seems like there there
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
was some confusion earlier in our
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
discussion i just i want to make sure
 
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.149 align:start position:0%
discussion i just i want to make sure
we're

00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
i don't really see any other any other
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
areas to
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
i mean other than what we've done
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
already for the inside in consultation
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
part i mean this is a relatively
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
short one and again the
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
process stuff
 
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
investigations renewals that's all
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:30.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
i can certainly email you a copy of the
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
decision maker like if there's an
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
advisory board
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
because that's a single-ended entity
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
and as
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
i mentioned before
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
leadership changes
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
right so leadership changes the
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
executive director that we have today
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
may not be a concern but if it changes
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
in three years or five years and we have
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
somebody who comes in who is not in
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
favor of out of hospital birth which has
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
happened in other states
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
uh there is definitely a threat to
 
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799 align:start position:0%
midwifery in that case if you have a
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
single entity making a decision even
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
with an advisory board so the advisory
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
board essentially could say no we don't
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
agree with whatever is being proposed
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
the executive director is the ultimate
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
executive director does not have
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
unfettered authority to make changes to
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
the rules they have to follow the laws
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
and we have a legislative oversight to
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
ensure that that is the case
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
this chapter that i was just glad about
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
the midwifery council
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
starts out by saying
 
00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:45.830 align:start position:0%
starts out by saying
that

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
we're in what does it say
 
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.710 align:start position:0%
we're in what does it say
midwifery

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
midwifery
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
it starts out by saying that the state
 
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.710 align:start position:0%
it starts out by saying that the state
is

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
is part of the culture
 
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
that childbirth is a culmination of
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
pregnancy a natural
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
process rather than an illness the
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
services of a certified midwife are
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable alternative for pregnant
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
women and intends that the scope of
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
midwifery shall be modeled on the
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
international definition of midwifery
 
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.149 align:start position:0%
international definition of midwifery
etc

00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
etc
 
00:30:18.159 --> 00:30:18.950 align:start position:0%
etc
so

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
we that's that's in the law that's not
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
changing that's not changing and the
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
executive director has
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
no ability to change any of the rules
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
that would that would conflict with that
 
00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.510 align:start position:0%
that would that would conflict with that
okay

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
if i may state also um
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
for the members of the council that
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
as part of the activity of this
 
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.070 align:start position:0%
as part of the activity of this
committee

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
because as you know we're acting on
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
these bills for several different boards
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
and we are attempting
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
when we put these forward to the full
 
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.470 align:start position:0%
when we put these forward to the full
legislature

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
to specifically state the intent
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the legislature
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
is to maintain the autonomy of the
 
00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.430 align:start position:0%
is to maintain the autonomy of the
boards

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
to control their professions
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
and that oplc does the administrative
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
and clerical work that we're trying to
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
state that as the intent going forward
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
on all of these to protect boards such
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
as yourself and keep in mind too the
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
write-ups that occur
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
that we do when in this is part of
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
the legal record so when
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
when judicially when they look at law
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
they will pull
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
what we write to look at legislative
 
00:31:33.679 --> 00:31:34.710 align:start position:0%
what we write to look at legislative
intent

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
intent
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
that's why we write them
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean it's a
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
clarification thing so and so does the
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
the lawyers that review the rules they
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
look at the legislative intent very
 
00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:48.149 align:start position:0%
look at the legislative intent very
closely

00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
closely
 
00:31:48.159 --> 00:31:51.269 align:start position:0%
closely
yep

00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:31:53.039 --> 00:31:54.310 align:start position:0%
okay so
seeing

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
if you want sure
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
and then we'll we'll end the
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
as the
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
chair of the new hampshire midwifery
 
00:32:11.679 --> 00:32:12.950 align:start position:0%
chair of the new hampshire midwifery
council

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
and i've said to you that i have tried
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
to work with oplc
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
and every time
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
we come up to an ish an issue a new one
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
comes up you know first it's your small
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
board then it's you don't have you know
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
enough members on your board which we
 
00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.710 align:start position:0%
enough members on your board which we
haven't

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
had a problem with um quorum we had a
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
small problem this summer our
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
rules our laws say we have four meetings
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
a year we have 12 meetings a year so
 
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
we've met our
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
quorum for by four you know so if we had
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
a few meetings that we didn't have
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
quorum because somebody was ill we've
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
met our judicial we've met our law
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
but it keeps coming up as an issue and
 
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
and it makes it sound like it's an issue
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the records you know i
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
have been chair
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
since i don't know i've been on the
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
board since 2015.
 
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
and when i say i've worked with oplc
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
when i've done the recertification or
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
the certifications
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
or any of the
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
investigations we've
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
you know given them
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
the records i'm not holding anything the
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
the midwife before that had no place to
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
put them
 
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
there was oplc was
 
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
you know and as soon as it came to a
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
place where we could put them
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
we brought them and there was boxes and
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
boxes and we don't know where they're if
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
i wanted to call up
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
a record from an older midwife
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
i don't know where i would get it i'm
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
assuming it's in there but
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
oplc site
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
it lists
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
who is current midwives and whose laps
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have the whole history
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's not unique to you at all
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
that that holds true for a lot of the
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
boards and there is someone at oplc that
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
is working backwards and that's right
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
and that's wonderful and we know they're
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
going to fix it i do have faith they're
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
going to fix it right but you know it's
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
like now it's been brought up you know
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
they're holding things in their house
 
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not holding anything and when i've
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
given something we've had
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
administrators assigned to us from oplc
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
that change i give them a bunch of stuff
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
it changes it goes away
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to track it i keep it
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
as the chair so i can keep track of
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
things so things don't get lost because
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
an investigation is you know a mother
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
and a baby a license is somebody's
 
00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.430 align:start position:0%
and a baby a license is somebody's
profession

00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
profession
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know so i'm trying to keep track of
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
things and i'm constantly getting a new
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
administrator and saying here's here's
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
this stuff and i give it to them
 
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
and the next meeting they're gone and i
 
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
don't know where it is so we give it
 
00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.430 align:start position:0%
don't know where it is so we give it
again

00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
we're really trying hard i have nothing
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
against the appeals oplc we want
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
this burden
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
to be given to them for the
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
administrative stuff but the concern is
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
the control of it
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
right where is that stuff going and it
 
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.950 align:start position:0%
right where is that stuff going and it
if

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
we could trust that
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
profession of midwifery didn't have a
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
stake in this we wouldn't be so
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
concerned but we are and so i just want
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
to address that because every time i sit
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
down to one of these meetings something
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
new comes up and i'm like
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
has anybody asked me have you asked me
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
when they want something what do you do
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
with it i give it to them happily i give
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
it to them 10 times if they need it you
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
know we are not
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
not trying to work with them
 
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
but again
 
00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.030 align:start position:0%
but again
statutorily

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
statutorily
 
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
we're giving them things that are we
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
even supposed to be right like
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
we work with the rules lawyers we've
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
done our rules several times in a row we
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
work with the people from oplc sit down
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
work with them we're giving them
 
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.349 align:start position:0%
work with them we're giving them
the

00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
expertise and they're giving us the
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
right words to do it we've gone through
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
the gel car process several times
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
you know we're
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to make our rules
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
ourselves we're trying to work within
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
the system the way it's supposed to
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
right we
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
the boards make the rules that goes
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
through gel cart it gets vetted by the
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
bigger professionals that know this is
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
okay and this is not
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
so i don't understand
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
i i just don't like i understand they're
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
trying to take all these small boards
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
and organize them
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
but i just i'm i'm just a little
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
confused to where this is all coming
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
from but anyways
 
00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.349 align:start position:0%
from but anyways
okay

00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
all right i'll uh i'll close the
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
yes i i saw a note that the governor
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
intends to
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
improve licensing and
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
since he hasn't told me how how he
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
intends to do it
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
yeah well that's one of the issues that
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
was in the state of state advice yeah
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
well that's great which is great but
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's a valid concern that the
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
we need to have better oversight overall
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
plc and that's
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
i do not personally know exactly how to
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
do so well we can model it
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
well no you can model it after health
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
and human services health and human
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
services committee has an oversight
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
committee for the department of health
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
and human services it would make sense
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
that that edna would have an oversight
 
00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.790 align:start position:0%
that that edna would have an oversight
representative

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
was going to put something forward for
 
00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.430 align:start position:0%
was going to put something forward for
this

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.270 align:start position:0%
this
session

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
i mean it wouldn't be germane to either
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
these buildings no no well yeah if you
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
if you wish to do so
 
00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.190 align:start position:0%
if you wish to do so
i

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
we haven't yet got any senate bills
 
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.030 align:start position:0%
we haven't yet got any senate bills
but

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
i've noticed that a large number of them
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
look like they're dead on arrival
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
so if you want to come up with a
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
oversight committee we can do a
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
non-jermaine amendment because i think
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's not a bad idea and you can model
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
it like i said brooke health and human
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
services human services
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
and it would just put there would be an
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
that edna would have over oplc for the
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
purposes of this
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
of hearing the concerns from the board
 
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.630 align:start position:0%
of hearing the concerns from the board
yeah

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.710 align:start position:0%
yeah
yep

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:22.390 align:start position:0%
yep
yeah

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
sure we would i mean they're sending us
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of days
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
are they really yeah
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.839 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
you
