there is nothing scheduled for next week
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
because I want the subcommittees to
 
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
finish all the bills we have in process
 
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
and also the people that have said
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
I want to look into this one so next

week do your looking into get your

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.350 align:start position:0%
can
um

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
and then we will
 
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 align:start position:0%

priorities

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 align:start position:0%
precisely we've got to get our
 
00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:01.979 align:start position:0%
priorities right
 
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm introducing the hearing on
 
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.580 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419 align:start position:0%
71 and I called Senator Carson
 
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair and good
 
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
morning to members of the House Edna
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
Sharon Carson and I have the pleasure of
 
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:24.860 align:start position:0%
representing Senate District 14
 
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
comprising the towns of Londonderry
 
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
Hudson and Auburn and I have for your
 
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
consideration this morning Senate Bill
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
71 which seeks to establish a commission
 
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
to study workers compensation for
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
firefighter cancer disease and allows
 
00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:41.699 align:start position:0%
for workers compensation for firefighter
 
00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:46.259 align:start position:0%
cancer disease of all types Madam chair
 
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure you're aware that we have
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
passed legislation concerning
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
um firefighters and cancer
 
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
and the list of those cancers which are
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
available for compensation are already
 
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
in statute but what this legislation
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
tries to do is to provide better support
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
and care for firefighters who are
 
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with cancer and to study the
 
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
implementation of National annual cancer
 
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
screenings the Prima facial presumption
 
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
in the legislation acknowledges that
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
cancer and firefighters is often caused
 
00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
by occupational exposure this provision
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
ensures that firefighters are eligible
 
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
for occupation cancer workers
 
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
compensation regardless of the form of
 
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:36.419 align:start position:0%
cancer and I'd like to point out because
 
00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
I notice some of the members of your
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
committee are from my district and in
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
case anyone doesn't know
 
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
we have an issue in my district as well
 
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
as in other districts of pfas in our
 
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
water and many of my constituents are on
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
bottled water because they cannot drink
 
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
the water from their own Wells due to
 
00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:03.959 align:start position:0%
contamination that's how serious this is
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
and I just didn't know if or make you
 
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
aware that pfas is located is currently
 
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
in firefighter protective gear so every
 
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
time they put on that protective gear
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
they are exposed to pfas and they have
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
no choice this is what they must wear to
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
protect themselves and quite frankly
 
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
Madam chair they're being exposed to
 
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
that pfas contamination
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
um currently our current law does not
 
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
include cancers such as brain cancer
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
stomach cancer mouth cancer
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
testicular cancer malignant melanoma
 
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
colon cancer Hodgkin's lymphoma and
 
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
female reproductive cancers which are
 
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
all commonly found in firefighters what
 
00:09:58.269 --> 00:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
this Commission
 
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
establishes in legislation will study
 
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
the prevalence of cancer among
 
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
firefighters the benefits of early
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
detection and the costs of optional
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
yearly cancer screening programs as seen
 
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:14.300 align:start position:0%
in other states
 
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
specifically Massachusetts and New
 
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.530 align:start position:0%
specifically Massachusetts and New
Jersey

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
Jersey
 
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.490 align:start position:0%
Jersey
um

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
Madam chair at this point I will
 
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
terminate I will end my my uh my
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
testimony I will try to answer any
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
questions I'll make sure to pass in a
 
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
pink card so you have it for your
 
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
records and thank you all very much for
 
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
your time and your consideration this
 
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.310 align:start position:0%
your time and your consideration this
morning

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
foreign yes thank you Senator I do have
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
one question sure why do we need to
 
00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:44.090 align:start position:0%
one question sure why do we need to
study

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.430 align:start position:0%
study
the

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
the benefits of of cancer screenings
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
when we know that they work if on Camp
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
cancers that
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
do have indications or that can be
 
00:10:58.009 --> 00:10:58.019 align:start position:0%
screened for
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I believe that's fairly well
 
00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:03.779 align:start position:0%
known in the medical field that that's
 
00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:05.030 align:start position:0%
known in the medical field that that's
useful

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
useful
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair it's my
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
this screening process is not currently
 
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
in statute and part of the study would
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
be to make that decision whether or not
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
to include it in statute I could be
 
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
wrong there are folks here who are much
 
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:26.220 align:start position:0%
more involved in this issue than I am
 
00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:28.820 align:start position:0%
but I agree with you completely
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
pre-screening I think is critical that
 
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
it should happen but I think we all know
 
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
that there are some folks that will find
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
themselves experiencing symptoms and
 
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
they won't
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
get looked at but if we say look you've
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
got to go through pre-screening I think
 
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
that might be the reason why it's there
 
00:11:54.889 --> 00:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
and they want to look at it so I'm okay
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for the
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
Senator Senator Grodin the neighbor
 
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
um in the bill I believe you mentioned
 
00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:08.459 align:start position:0%
that there is
 
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
now going to be workman's workman's
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
compensation won't be limited to the
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
type of cancer correct so where does it
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
say that I see that it's been stricken
 
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
from lines five to eight
 
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
but I don't is there someplace else
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
where it says that they'll receive
 
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
compensation I don't see that in here so
 
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
um thank you I the copy that I have is
 
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.329 align:start position:0%
um thank you I the copy that I have is
introduced

00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:38.339 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe if it was stricken it
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
was probably stricken in house finance
 
00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me Senate Finance I don't have
 
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
that copy all I have is as introduced
 
00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:50.700 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes this ad is the version as
 
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
introduced okay
 
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.569 align:start position:0%
introduced okay
um

00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:53.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
to do this one we have I don't think it
 
00:12:57.129 --> 00:12:57.139 align:start position:0%
was I think
 
00:12:59.690 --> 00:12:59.700 align:start position:0%
I think this section is in the workers
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
comp section and it does say in here
 
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
there shall exist Prima facial
 
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
presumption the cancer disease the
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
firefighter is occupationally closed I'm
 
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
so sorry and so all it does is remove
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
the limitation I was
 
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
okay if I had just read the line above
 
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
where it says workman's compensation it
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
would have been helpful thank you you're
 
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you thank you for that
 
00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:22.019 align:start position:0%
safe representative Lucas because I was
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
a little confused there because I didn't
 
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:27.740 align:start position:0%
see that okay representing the baby bear
 
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
Madam chair logistical I just read the
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
same thing and thought it was excluding
 
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
what Senator Carson had just detailed
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
out so I missed it too thank you
 
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
all right we will have remedial reading
 
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
classes next week representative Simon
 
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I think my
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
question was pretty much answered but I
 
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify uh Senator and
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question this
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
bill does two things it establishes as a
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
study committee and it also
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
um institutes the presumption that any
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
cancer that is ever found in any
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
firefighter is based in the work
 
00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:08.339 align:start position:0%
is is um
 
00:14:08.339 --> 00:14:10.430 align:start position:0%
is is um
occupationally

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
occupationally
 
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
correct you are correct sorry I couldn't
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
come up with the last word but thank you
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
that's okay no no you're you're exactly
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
correct it does establish the commission
 
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
um to study the compensation for
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
firefighter cancer disease and it allows
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
for workers compensation for firefighter
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
so not just for all types though correct
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
there will be a presumption that the
 
00:14:35.449 --> 00:14:35.459 align:start position:0%
cancer that they had is the result of
 
00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
their occupation correct okay thank you
 
00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:41.220 align:start position:0%
well I trust there aren't any smoking
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
firefighters around because that would
 
00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:45.530 align:start position:0%
firefighters around because that would
um

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
I mean there are many known cases where
 
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
other than
 
00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:53.339 align:start position:0%
exposure to contaminants I mean you
 
00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:55.019 align:start position:0%
mentioned melanoma
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh it's representative baldosaro for
 
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
example developed melanoma I would I
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
would say that's not related to his
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
exposure to toxic substances due to his
 
00:15:07.569 --> 00:15:07.579 align:start position:0%
excessive toasting
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
well I think Madam chair I I'm on good
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
ground to say representative baldosaur
 
00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
is really
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
um the epitome of a sun worshiper
 
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
yes but it's some worshiping is known to
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
cause cancer and I
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
I would hope that the um
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
the workers comp board would take that
 
00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
into and those those kind of things into
 
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:36.860 align:start position:0%
consideration when saying it's
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
caused but okay thank you any uh
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
very very sympathetic to the issue with
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
firefighters uh as the senator uh
 
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
brought up but I had a process question
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
in my second life is my committee on
 
00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.329 align:start position:0%
in my second life is my committee on
commissions

00:15:59.329 --> 00:15:59.339 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
um would an option be to hand this back
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
to HHS for them to study this issue
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
within their own committee
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
this is a new commission this bill is
 
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
not going to any other committee we're
 
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
stuck with it
 
00:16:20.569 --> 00:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
um in fact now that I'm looking at it
 
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:22.740 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I think you've got a problem
 
00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.410 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I think you've got a problem
okay

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
section two which is the study committee
 
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
takes place
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
take effect in November
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
the repeal in Section 3 takes place on
 
00:16:35.459 --> 00:16:37.249 align:start position:0%
the repeal in Section 3 takes place on
Passage

00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
Passage
 
00:16:37.259 --> 00:16:39.470 align:start position:0%
Passage
so

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
is that what you meant to do
 
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.310 align:start position:0%
is that what you meant to do
um

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I will leave that up to you
 
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll we'll deal with it but
 
00:16:50.449 --> 00:16:50.459 align:start position:0%
so you're appealing basically you're
 
00:16:53.569 --> 00:16:53.579 align:start position:0%
repealing commission before it's founded
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
okay good makes it much easier for the
 
00:16:59.170 --> 00:16:59.180 align:start position:0%
committee on commissions
 
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
okay representative O'Brien
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
um and thank you senator for taking my
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
question as the senator probably knows I
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
was a firefighter for 35 years and what
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
the senator believed that
 
00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:19.579 align:start position:0%
early in my career was uh
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
reclining uniform requirement that we
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
wore white skivvies you know t-shirts
 
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
and everything else so which we did
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
and I used to have to throw them out
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
after every single fire because you
 
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
can't get to sit out of them you know so
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
I often wondered what was getting into
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
my skin so therefore besides the pifa's
 
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
uh pffas and everything else we do
 
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
breathe through the skin I know you may
 
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
not be technically you know Savvy as far
 
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
as the medical profusion and everything
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
else but until the firefighter gets back
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
to the station and have a chance and
 
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
most fire departments have that now
 
00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
decontamination but until that point you
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
got you know this stuff is right on your
 
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
skin would I be correct in assuming that
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes you would
 
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
be representative as well as any
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
chemical that was used to put out the
 
00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:21.299 align:start position:0%
fire would also be on your skin and I
 
00:18:24.529 --> 00:18:24.539 align:start position:0%
believe that's why melanoma was included
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
um in in that because we we
 
00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
automatically make the assumption that
 
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
melanoma is caused because of an
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
overexposure to the Sun but there are
 
00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:36.299 align:start position:0%
other reasons why an individual would
 
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
have melanoma and I think that's why
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
requiring early screening and or an
 
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
annual screening is you can catch that
 
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
way ahead of time before it has a chance
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
to spread to an individual's lymph nodes
 
00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:52.340 align:start position:0%
and cause problems elsewhere
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
you're welcome okay represent Gerhard
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
and then Lucas thank you madam chair
 
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
in 2000 this is related just follow me
 
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
for once okay in 2008 California started
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
putting up cell towers on the fire
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
departments and there was immediate
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
within a week the firemen were
 
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
experiencing memory loss um
 
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
at UNH Ken Chamberlain was commissioned
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
through the governor in both uh chambers
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
of the legislature it's the head of
 
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
Wi-Fi and cellular radiation commission
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
that actually they released like a 380
 
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
page report but it's just interesting
 
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
inside of this health
 
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
within a week they developed unusual
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
symptoms of headaches fatigue insomnia
 
00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:33.419 align:start position:0%
memory loss after while firefighters in
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
stations with adjacent cell towers were
 
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
found aftergotten CPR or became lost
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
responding to a fire call in the city
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
they grew up in
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
so my point is in my town There's A Fire
 
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
there's a cell tower right by the fire
 
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
department and they claim it's okay
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
because it's not permanently occupied
 
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
but I'm just concerned would you would
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
your commission also look into this
 
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
because there's been studies with
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
schools having these towers up and
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
children developing brain cancer and so
 
00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:56.570 align:start position:0%
children developing brain cancer and so
forth

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
is that something this commission would
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
be involved in studying since it's
 
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
affecting them as well as everyone else
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
um the way that I read it that they
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
would be discussing all types of
 
00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:12.179 align:start position:0%
diseases or cancer so if someone wanted
 
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
to bring that up I would think that the
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
commission would entertain that
 
00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
information as well all right thank you
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
all right um I thought I heard you say
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
that there was in statute a list of
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
cancers currently that are considered uh
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
work related for firemen where where is
 
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.610 align:start position:0%
work related for firemen where where is
that

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't remember exactly
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative where they're located I
 
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
just remember that legislation was
 
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
passed a few years ago where certain
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
types of cancers were specified in
 
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.130 align:start position:0%
types of cancers were specified in
statute

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
um so I I wouldn't be able to tell you
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
exactly where it is I'm sure that the
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
folks that are going to be coming up
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
behind me would be able to answer that
 
00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
question better than I could follow up
 
00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mr Greenland if you could
 
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
check and find out where that list is
 
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
for us we'd appreciate it
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
the reason I ask is that I'm wondering
 
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
if there's a conflict because of
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
somewhere in statute it lists a specific
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
list of cancer types that are considered
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
um occupation related for firemen
 
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
um you know would that still have an
 
00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
effect even if um you know this section
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
here were struck out that was my concern
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.330 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
representative

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
um the commission if you deem to pass it
 
00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
will do its work and hopefully there
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
will be legislative findings and
 
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
legislative recommendations and if that
 
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
means filing a piece of legislation to
 
00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
amend any existing statute to expand
 
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
that list that would be within the
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
purview of the commission to make that
 
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
recommendation and if that
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
recommendation is ma is made by any
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
member of this committee please include
 
00:21:59.390 --> 00:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
me as a co-sponsor uh Senator the
 
00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
problem is that
 
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
the first section applies no matter what
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
the commission does and it simply
 
00:22:08.039 --> 00:22:09.950 align:start position:0%
the commission does and it simply
deletes

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
deletes
 
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.330 align:start position:0%
deletes
um

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
basically it says that list is
 
00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
irrelevant because any type of cancer is
 
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
considered to be covered
 
00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
so I'm I agree that we're going to have
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
to look at what's going on in the other
 
00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
statutes before we do something like
 
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
that Madam chair I would agree with with
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
you on that
 
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
the commission will do its work and if
 
00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
the commission decides well all cancers
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
might be a little too much
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
look at what we already have in statute
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
and we're going to add a couple things
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
to it again that has to be done
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
statutorily so I guess you can say I'm
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
trying to cover all bases
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
because we don't you don't know what a
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
commission will find and they will do
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
the work follow-up representative yeah
 
00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
I'm I mean because of that and it looks
 
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
like the details this might come out of
 
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
the commission I'm wondering if
 
00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
at this point although I'm sympathetic
 
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
because getting rid of of section one
 
00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:09.419 align:start position:0%
might make sense and let the commission
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
decide what's the right thing to do and
 
00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:15.059 align:start position:0%
then have future legislations that's
 
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
you know interesting comment we'll take
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
it up in the executive session
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien thank you madam
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
chair and follow up along the same lines
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
with representative Lakers but your
 
00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
intention here of this particular bill
 
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
is to look at all cancers in other words
 
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
when Dupont invented Nomex which is you
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
know contaminated with pifas and
 
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
firefighters are now wearing this they
 
00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
were selling that as a life safety
 
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
enhancement to Firefighters who knew 30
 
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
years ago that it would cause these type
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
of cancers of firefighters so we have to
 
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
be a little bit more open-minded uh and
 
00:23:57.409 --> 00:23:57.419 align:start position:0%
that's what your intention is with this
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
bill what may not be cancerous now we
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
may find other products coming down
 
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
through invention or whatever trying to
 
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
increase the safety may actually be
 
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
doing more harm than good to 500 suits
 
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
that's your intention yes
 
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
um just rub representative just I mean
 
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
for general knowledge a few years we had
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
legislation dealing with the types of
 
00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:24.299 align:start position:0%
foam that deals with putting out
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
chemical fires that the the exposure
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
um was extremely toxic for firefighters
 
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
and we did address that particular issue
 
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
and in the at the time that the foam was
 
00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:39.909 align:start position:0%
and in the at the time that the foam was
first

00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
used or and created it was look this is
 
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
for a specific purpose but then we find
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
out it's contaminating our water and our
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
ground as well as affecting the
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
firefighters that are using it so now I
 
00:24:57.649 --> 00:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
I don't exactly remember what we what
 
00:24:59.390 --> 00:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
happened but I do know that we pass
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
legislation dealing with that because we
 
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
felt that not only the firefighters
 
00:25:06.409 --> 00:25:06.419 align:start position:0%
needed to be protected
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
um the environment needed to be
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
protected from this chemical that was
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
sold to us as being essential and it was
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
going to put out really horrible
 
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
chemical fires
 
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are there any other
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
questions for the senator
 
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
seeing none I would like to say you're
 
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
extremely optimistic in thinking that a
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
15 person commission can be appointed
 
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
and actually accomplished something in
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
six months Madam chair I have the most
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
faith in all of your ability to deal
 
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
with this and every member of the house
 
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
if they're assigned they're going to do
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
their job and they're going to do a good
 
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.870 align:start position:0%
their job and they're going to do a good
job

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
job
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you oh and by the way we
 
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
have kind of like an informal rule in
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
the Senate if you uh propose a
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
commission you get to serve on it so
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
um if you should deem to pass this the
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
Senate I will be the Senate member so
 
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for letting Senator
 
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
Susie Rosenwald and Abbas off the hook
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
I'm letting them all off the hook no
 
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
there's two senators so oh well we'll
 
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'll find someone else to work with me
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.529 --> 00:26:36.539 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the record I'm
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
Mike Rollo I'm the director of
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
government relations for the American
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
Cancer Society cancer Action Network in
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Vermont and I thought
 
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
for sure I would be going last because I
 
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
thought all the firefighters would be
 
00:26:48.529 --> 00:26:48.539 align:start position:0%
going first because they'd have better
 
00:26:51.289 --> 00:26:51.299 align:start position:0%
information for you but here I sit and I
 
00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
am here in support of section two we
 
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
don't have uh we don't have a position
 
00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
on section one ma'am uh just section two
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
the study which seems to be getting the
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
most attention this afternoon as well
 
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.810 align:start position:0%
most attention this afternoon as well
um

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:04.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
we um much of our surprise when I was
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
looking at titles of the bill and and
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
tracking it when it was finally printed
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
I noticed that my organization was uh
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
going to be a member of this commission
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
so I thought we'd better we better pay
 
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
even more attention to this and we'd be
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
happy to help
 
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
um has been listening to to Senator
 
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
Carson's testimony and then the
 
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
questions the first question that you
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
yourself raised Madam chair was
 
00:27:36.649 --> 00:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
well we all know that early detection
 
00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
and prevention is important and it works
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't think anyone is
 
00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:42.779 align:start position:0%
questioning that I mean we all
 
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.649 align:start position:0%
understand that
um

00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
and it's true
 
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
um that um
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
testing is very important
 
00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
um and you won't get any argument out of
 
00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:57.529 align:start position:0%
um and you won't get any argument out of
us

00:27:57.529 --> 00:27:57.539 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
but I think what's really important if
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
you go down the list of all the other uh
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
potential duties of this commission if
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
you go down to line seven I'm sorry I'm
 
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:08.220 align:start position:0%
on page two by the way if you go down to
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
line seven that's uh letter F and I
 
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
didn't bring my glasses but you know
 
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
because I've only been doing this for
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
over a decade but
 
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
um the existence and access to potential
 
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
third-party vendors to provide cancer
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
screenings and early detection for
 
00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
firefighters that goes hand in hand with
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
the health benefits of early detection
 
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
which is uh letter C line one
 
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
um there are tests that are being
 
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
developed currently and there's more in
 
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
the pipeline that are able to do things
 
00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:45.260 align:start position:0%
that current testing can only dream of
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
currently if you go get a mammogram it's
 
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
testing for one type of cancer if you go
 
00:28:54.409 --> 00:28:54.419 align:start position:0%
get a colonoscopy it's testing for we're
 
00:28:58.930 --> 00:28:58.940 align:start position:0%
looking for one type of cancer there are
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
tests being developed there's one and
 
00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
now that I'm sitting here I'm drawing a
 
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
blank on what is actually the name of it
 
00:29:06.169 --> 00:29:06.179 align:start position:0%
the commercial name of it but the test
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
being developed through
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
Mass General down in Boston that's a
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
blood test that is looking at screening
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
that that Mass General is partnering
 
00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419 align:start position:0%
with communities within Massachusetts I
 
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
know whether than fire service but I'm
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
sure that the folks from the fire
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
service behind me can probably we'll
 
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
probably speak to this as well
 
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
um they're used they're they're they're
 
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're testing this as
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
a means of doing early detection for for
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
cancers that we have no test for
 
00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
currently commercial tests for currently
 
00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:51.299 align:start position:0%
so why do we need a commission to look
 
00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
at whether or not early detection is
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
important because we already know it's
 
00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
important because there are options
 
00:30:00.289 --> 00:30:00.299 align:start position:0%
coming that may not be commercially
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
available at the moment but may be
 
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
coming soon very soon that you might
 
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
want to be looking at and investigating
 
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
and perhaps there are opportunities for
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire Community to be part of
 
00:30:15.409 --> 00:30:15.419 align:start position:0%
the the tests that are ongoing now I
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know that there I don't
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
want to speak for those research
 
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.610 align:start position:0%
want to speak for those research
hospitals

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
yeah pardon me that are doing the
 
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
research currently but I mean there
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
could be opportunities out there so I um
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
I for one don't know if I want to spend
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
my entire summer home by doing this I
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
mean I I will do it because it's very
 
00:30:36.409 --> 00:30:36.419 align:start position:0%
important work I don't mean to make
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
light of this it's very important work
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
um there is a lot of work that needs to
 
00:30:45.169 --> 00:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
be done
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
every single one of these letters are
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
listed here isn't something that's
 
00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
important that needs to be studied so
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
that's why this study is important
 
00:30:54.529 --> 00:30:54.539 align:start position:0%
that's why you would want to consider
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
adding one more additional study to the
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
very long list of
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
studies that you're considering
 
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.250 align:start position:0%
studies that you're considering
mothballing

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:03.260 align:start position:0%
mothballing
 
00:31:06.289 --> 00:31:06.299 align:start position:0%
pardon me excuse me
 
00:31:08.889 --> 00:31:08.899 align:start position:0%
um I understand the the
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
overwhelming desire to get rid of and
 
00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
not and perhaps add to the very long
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
list of commissions that need to be
 
00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
mothballed I get that this is one of
 
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
those that um that needs to be
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
decommissioned before it's commissioned
 
00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:25.740 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that's long overdue
 
00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
this is um I think every time you look
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
at the news or read a newspaper it seems
 
00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
like we're learning about another
 
00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:37.140 align:start position:0%
firefighter in our towns that has
 
00:31:39.409 --> 00:31:39.419 align:start position:0%
developed a cancer
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
um I think back to over a decade ago to
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
the city of Portsmouth there was a young
 
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
firefighter who had developed a breast
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
cancer that um they didn't think was
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
related to her service I think they now
 
00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
know that it was you know 20 I actually
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
do the math now 28 years ago my father
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
died of colon cancer
 
00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
um he smoked for 50 something years and
 
00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
everyone said well he didn't die of lung
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
cancer so it had nothing to do with his
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
smoking we now know that colon cancer
 
00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:15.539 align:start position:0%
stomach cancer and a whole Hood bladder
 
00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
cancer these are all affected by smoking
 
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
we didn't know that years ago
 
00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.110 align:start position:0%
we didn't know that years ago
representative

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
um I remember it was you madam chair
 
00:32:24.889 --> 00:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
brought up about melanoma and our dear
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
friend former representative beldazaro
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
and his his love of tanning well and
 
00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
then representative O'Brien brought up
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
the the pfaffs and some of the Foams and
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
and the gear that he used to wear
 
00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
we now know that there's a connection
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
between some melanoma the melanomas and
 
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
some of those those chemicals that he
 
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
was exposed to as a career firefighter
 
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
that we might not have known a few years
 
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
ago so it's an evolving science cancer
 
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
it's not a static science so
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
I don't want to belabor this point but
 
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
this study commission is one that I
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
think you really do want to embrace and
 
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:02.220 align:start position:0%
and as much as I might not want to spend
 
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
my summer and fall on this building
 
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
either I think it's one that we gotta
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
have to do and I'm happy to take
 
00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:09.539 align:start position:0%
questions man thank you are there
 
00:33:09.539 --> 00:33:11.810 align:start position:0%
questions man thank you are there
questions

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none very good thank you
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:31.810 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:31.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:34.019 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
good morning uh if I could I'm going to
 
00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:39.059 align:start position:0%
I've submitted some written testimony
 
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to give my verbal testimony
 
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
this morning and then I hope to clear up
 
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
some of uh the questions that you had uh
 
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson
 
00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:51.059 align:start position:0%
first I'd like to uh thank Senator
 
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
Carson for her continued advocacy for
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
the health and safety of firefighters
 
00:33:59.630 --> 00:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
she is astonish advocate for for us and
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
our membership my name is Brian rill and
 
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:03.419 align:start position:0%
I serve as the president of the
 
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
professional firefighters from New
 
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm also a captain for the
 
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:08.220 align:start position:0%
city of Portsmouth Fire Department
 
00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
professional firefighters of New
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire represents 42 local unions and
 
00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:15.419 align:start position:0%
approximately 2 000 active and retired
 
00:34:17.089 --> 00:34:17.099 align:start position:0%
professional firefighters and paramedics
 
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
across the granite state
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
there's a preeminent firefighter
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
organization in New Hampshire we
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
advocate for the health and safety of
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
the brave men and women that protect the
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
citizens of this great state I'm here to
 
00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
testify and support as you can imagine
 
00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:32.339 align:start position:0%
of Senate bill 71.
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
research conducted by the National
 
00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
Institute for occupational safety and
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
health shows that firefighters have a 14
 
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
higher risk of dying from cancer than
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
the general population
 
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
in fact occupational cancer recently
 
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
surpassed heart attack as the leading
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
cause of line of duty deaths in the fire
 
00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.329 align:start position:0%
cause of line of duty deaths in the fire
service

00:34:50.329 --> 00:34:50.339 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:34:54.169 --> 00:34:54.179 align:start position:0%
in 2019 more than 75 percent of the
 
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
names added to the International
 
00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
Association of firefighters Fallen
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
Firefighter Memorial were members who
 
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
died from occupational cancer
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's no secret that firefighting is an
 
00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
inherently dangerous profession
 
00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
firefighters lay their lives on the line
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
day in and day out to protect the lives
 
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
and property of complete strangers
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they're rewarded with a
 
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
cancer diagnosis for their efforts
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
in 2018 New Hampshire took a huge step
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
in advocating for and protecting their
 
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
firefighters by passing Senate Bill 541
 
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
which provides presumptive cancer
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
coverage for occupational cancer
 
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
this legislation laid the foundation for
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
comprehensive cancer coverage for
 
00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
firefighters in the state of New
 
00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Senate Bill 71 is an
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
attempt to build upon this Foundation
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
if passed Senate Bill 71 would expand
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
the presumptive cancer coverage to be
 
00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
inclusive of all cancers
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
you heard Senator Carson testify this
 
00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
morning as to some of the cancers that
 
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
aren't currently covered
 
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
uh under our current statute
 
00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
current law states that occupational
 
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
cancer must be a type which may be
 
00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
caused by the exposure to heat radiation
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
or a known carcinogen as defined by the
 
00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
international Agency for research on
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
cancer I heard a question asked this
 
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
morning as to where that list was found
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
in statute it is in fact a document
 
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
under the international Agency for
 
00:36:22.849 --> 00:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
research on cancer that is cited in this
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
statute so that can be identified
 
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
through through research from this
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
agency I will say the way that they've
 
00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:34.940 align:start position:0%
structured this is a multi-tier
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
structure to say that firefighters are
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
more susceptible to being diagnosed with
 
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
certain types of cancer under a tier one
 
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
and then there's a tier two where
 
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
they're less likely and so on and so
 
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
forth this has created a problem with
 
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
presumptive workers compensation as many
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
of our
 
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
members claims have been denied by by
 
00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
current law as you heard Senator Carson
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
speak to excludes an extensive list of
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
cancers that I won't repeat uh for the
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
sake of of time here one that I do want
 
00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:15.380 align:start position:0%
to identify
 
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
that is in fact covered but I think it
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
really supports the claim that
 
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
firefighters are at an increased risk of
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
developing cancer is malignant
 
00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.109 align:start position:0%
developing cancer is malignant
mesothelioma

00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
mesothelioma
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
this is an extremely rare form of cancer
 
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
that affects the tissue that lines the
 
00:37:35.329 --> 00:37:35.339 align:start position:0%
lungs stomach heart and other organs
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's a cancer in which firefighters are
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
129 percent more likely to die from than
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
the general population
 
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
this statistic makes it easy to
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
understand why the expansive expensive
 
00:37:50.569 --> 00:37:50.579 align:start position:0%
coverage under this RSA is so critical
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
to our firefighters
 
00:37:55.609 --> 00:37:55.619 align:start position:0%
and as the second part of this
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
legislation States it would establish a
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
commission to study the implementation
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
of these cancer screenings for
 
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.109 align:start position:0%
of these cancer screenings for
firefighters

00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
firefighters
 
00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:05.339 align:start position:0%
early diagnosis of as we've heard
 
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
discussed this morning of cancer focuses
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
on detecting symptomatic patients as
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
early as possible nobody can deny that
 
00:38:17.089 --> 00:38:17.099 align:start position:0%
early detection is key and critical
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
early diagnosis improves cancer outcomes
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
by providing care at the earliest
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
possible stage and is therefore an
 
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
important Public Health strategy
 
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
cancer screenings on the other hand
 
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
which is what we're just discussing this
 
00:38:32.329 --> 00:38:32.339 align:start position:0%
morning are summarized slightly
 
00:38:32.339 --> 00:38:33.770 align:start position:0%
morning are summarized slightly
differently

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
differently
 
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
the World Health Organization defines a
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
screening as a presumptive
 
00:38:40.849 --> 00:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
identification of unrecognized disease
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
in an apparently healthy asymptomatic
 
00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
population by means of tests
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
examinations or other procedures that
 
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
can be applied rapidly and easily
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
compared to early diagnosis cancer
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
screenings are a distinct and more
 
00:38:59.089 --> 00:38:59.099 align:start position:0%
complex Public Health strategy that
 
00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:00.980 align:start position:0%
requires additional resources
 
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and coordination
 
00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
this is not a strategy which can be
 
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
developed overnight and it is one in
 
00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.099 align:start position:0%
which requires planning research and
 
00:39:11.099 --> 00:39:12.290 align:start position:0%
which requires planning research and
collaboration

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
collaboration
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
this is why this commission to identify
 
00:39:17.569 --> 00:39:17.579 align:start position:0%
this structure and the processes of such
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
an elaborate program are especially
 
00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.790 align:start position:0%
an elaborate program are especially
crucial

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
the importance of this portion of Senate
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 71 cannot be overstated
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
as a routine cancer screening program
 
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
would promote early detection and offer
 
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
potentially life-saving intervention for
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
firefighters while reducing long-term
 
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
costs to employers and risk pool
 
00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:38.990 align:start position:0%
costs to employers and risk pool
providers

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
again the World Health Organization in
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
research states that the cost of health
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
care for patients who receive early
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
cancer diagnosis is two to four times
 
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
less than that
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
for those who have an advanced diagnosis
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
this is significant when we consider the
 
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
financial burden for cancer related
 
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
Health Care is projected to surpass 246
 
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
although this legislation is Progressive
 
00:40:11.089 --> 00:40:11.099 align:start position:0%
in its intent it should be noted that
 
00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
other states have already implemented
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
screening programs similar to what we're
 
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
asking for and have had great success
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and New Jersey were
 
00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
mentioned Massachusetts screens
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
firefighters for prostate lung skin and
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
mouth cancer while New Jersey screens
 
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
for 11 different types of cancers
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
a quick Google search will show you that
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
similar programs exist in other states
 
00:40:38.089 --> 00:40:38.099 align:start position:0%
including Colorado South Carolina and
 
00:40:38.099 --> 00:40:39.230 align:start position:0%
including Colorado South Carolina and
California

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
California
 
00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
most notably Vermont is nearing passage
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
of legislation similar to that of what
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
we're trying to push forward today and
 
00:40:49.849 --> 00:40:49.859 align:start position:0%
in fact is being heard in the house and
 
00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
committee today as well
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
this has received widespread support
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
from policy makers in Vermont
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
so when we discuss the importance of not
 
00:41:04.569 --> 00:41:04.579 align:start position:0%
only including all cancers
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
the screening study commission is
 
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
incredibly important not only to figure
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
out how to develop such a complex
 
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
program but to figure out how to do so
 
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
and and remain
 
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
financially responsible in in getting a
 
00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
program like this completed
 
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
so with that um
 
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to answer any questions
 
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
I I would ask Madam chair in hearing
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
your your question to Senator Carson uh
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
and as those the organization that
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
requested this bill be passed
 
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
um to give the commission some more time
 
00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
and potentially move this date to
 
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
November of 2024 rather than 2023
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
um and and being respectful to
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
everyone's time
 
00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
um and then the last thing I would touch
 
00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:58.460 align:start position:0%
upon that was a question that was asked
 
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh is that just because all cancers
 
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
would be covered under the presumption
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
there are still
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
a number of safeguards in place to
 
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
ensure that uh the
 
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
the cancer is in fact job related
 
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair you mentioned smoking and
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
members that uh you you hope that
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
members don't smoke there is Provisions
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
in current statute that members need to
 
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
live a tobacco-free lifestyle
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
in addition just because there is
 
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
presumptive coverage that doesn't
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that all cancers will
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
be covered
 
00:42:41.569 --> 00:42:41.579 align:start position:0%
um under under the law it's just the
 
00:42:44.089 --> 00:42:44.099 align:start position:0%
presumptive coverage moves the burden of
 
00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
proof to the workers comp carrier rather
 
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
the employee
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
so once again thank you for your time
 
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions I
 
00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
urge your support of this very critical
 
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
legislation okay I have a number of
 
00:42:59.809 --> 00:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
questions uh first of all I understand
 
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
that near legal firefighters are
 
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
employed by municipalities
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
correct and each municipality has its
 
00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.130 align:start position:0%
correct and each municipality has its
own

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
health coverage of some sort for its
 
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
employees correct correct so is the
 
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
would be fair to say that one effect of
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
this bill will be to move all cancer
 
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
cases to workers comp and essentially
 
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
consolidate all of them under workers
 
00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.390 align:start position:0%
consolidate all of them under workers
comp

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
I would say on its surface yes initially
 
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
if I make a cancer claim it would be it
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
would go under workers compensation but
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
it would be no different than any other
 
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
workers compensation claim
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
um a a
 
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
someone would look at it an adjuster
 
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
would look at this determine whether or
 
00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:51.710 align:start position:0%
would look at this determine whether or
not

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
um it does meet the requirements of the
 
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
law and either approve the claim for
 
00:43:59.089 --> 00:43:59.099 align:start position:0%
deny it and then move forward in that
 
00:44:02.809 --> 00:44:02.819 align:start position:0%
process eventually these May Circle back
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
around to be covered under Health Care
 
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
okay so that's what you so that's what
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
you meant when you said that some claims
 
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
were workers comp claims were denied is
 
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
that they are now falling back on the
 
00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
employers insurance
 
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:20.150 align:start position:0%
correct okay
okay

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
um I also had a question
 
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
um if cancer is that much of a concern
 
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
for firefighters
 
00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
why aren't they taking the initiative to
 
00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
get these cancer screenings
 
00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
earlier and more often
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
because I mean that's what somebody who
 
00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.010 align:start position:0%
because I mean that's what somebody who
has

00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
you know an inherited risk for cancer
 
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
does is you start earlier and you do it
 
00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
more frequently because they're more
 
00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
likely to catch something is that not
 
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
common practice among the firefighters
 
00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
so we are just like everyone else for
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
likely in this room are subject to what
 
00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
our health care will cover
 
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
um for instance because we are at higher
 
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
risk we are eligible to receive
 
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.150 align:start position:0%
risk we are eligible to receive
um

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
diagnostic testing like colonoscopies at
 
00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
an earlier age than the general
 
00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:16.569 align:start position:0%
an earlier age than the general
population

00:45:16.569 --> 00:45:16.579 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:45:16.579 --> 00:45:18.190 align:start position:0%
population
however

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of screening or
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
tests that can be conducted but it tends
 
00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
a significant cost to that that in a lot
 
00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
of cases your insurance provider does
 
00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
interesting thank you representative
 
00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
so on March 17th there was a one of the
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
local affiliates down in Natick
 
00:45:48.119 --> 00:45:49.309 align:start position:0%
local affiliates down in Natick
Massachusetts

00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
they're instituting heart screenings for
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
Natick police through the fire
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
department police department and also
 
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
surrounding ones a 39 year old fell dead
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
from a heart attack so I'm just curious
 
00:46:02.089 --> 00:46:02.099 align:start position:0%
as to do you see this expanding into the
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
other branches of public service because
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
there's there's health issues that we've
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
seen rise in unexplained deaths over
 
00:46:11.089 --> 00:46:11.099 align:start position:0%
many different fields recently
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm just curious do you see that as a
 
00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
future angle or is this simply for fire
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
department that's it
 
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
I can tell you I represent firefighters
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
um and my angle is cancer screenings for
 
00:46:24.119 --> 00:46:25.430 align:start position:0%
um and my angle is cancer screenings for
firefighters

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
um I would love to see all public safety
 
00:46:32.329 --> 00:46:32.339 align:start position:0%
personnel be protected to whatever their
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
um whatever they're most susceptible to
 
00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you I you will not see me
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
come to you and ask you for legislation
 
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
for police officers or other Personnel
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
outside of the firefighters
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
okay other questions
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
I saw a study that was done that looked
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
um the time it takes to put out a fire
 
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
and how that's changed over the years
 
00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:17.220 align:start position:0%
and the outcome is was that um fires
 
00:47:19.609 --> 00:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
consume buildings much quicker today
 
00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:22.460 align:start position:0%
than it did in Years Gone by and that
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
that's because of the chemicals in all
 
00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
of the items in a building
 
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
that didn't used to be there do you know
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
if any my question to you is do you know
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
if there have been any studies as we
 
00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.329 align:start position:0%
if there have been any studies as we
heard

00:47:35.329 --> 00:47:35.339 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
um representative O'Brien talk about the
 
00:47:41.809 --> 00:47:41.819 align:start position:0%
skin absorbing the toxins on the amount
 
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
of toxins
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
that uh are are put out in these fires
 
00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
when all of the materials if we look in
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
this building these materials are not
 
00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
natural materials they're chemical
 
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
materials and do we have there been
 
00:47:57.890 --> 00:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
studies that have looked at that and the
 
00:47:59.930 --> 00:47:59.940 align:start position:0%
impact that has on cancer to our
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
firefighters thanks for the question
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh I I will say yes and
 
00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
and I can try and identify some of those
 
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
studies for you I don't have any of them
 
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
offhand what I will tell you is is you
 
00:48:14.089 --> 00:48:14.099 align:start position:0%
hit the nail right on the head
 
00:48:14.099 --> 00:48:14.809 align:start position:0%
hit the nail right on the head
um

00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:14.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know many years ago
 
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh with Legacy construction as you
 
00:48:21.839 --> 00:48:22.790 align:start position:0%
uh with Legacy construction as you
mentioned

00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
materials used to build a house where
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
natural materials a lot of the furniture
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
that you would buy was not coated with
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
as many chemicals now everything that
 
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
burns within a residence
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
um has polycarbons in it which cause
 
00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:41.220 align:start position:0%
cancer and then I and I heard identified
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
earlier was the pfas in our turnout gear
 
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
there is not a manufacturer out there
 
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
currently that manufactures protective
 
00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
turnout gear are our protective
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
equipment that we wear to every fire
 
00:48:59.230 --> 00:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
that does not have pfas chemicals in it
 
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
so we are going to put out
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
the the communities house fires
 
00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.150 align:start position:0%
the the communities house fires
knowingly

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
knowingly
 
00:49:10.609 --> 00:49:10.619 align:start position:0%
um the the gear that we're using so that
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:17.339 align:start position:0%
representative true and then O'Brien
 
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:19.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm I'm trying to
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
understand the ramifications of section
 
00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.730 align:start position:0%
understand the ramifications of section
one

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:49:28.609 --> 00:49:28.619 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:49:28.619 --> 00:49:29.750 align:start position:0%
of the bill
so

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:31.849 --> 00:49:31.859 align:start position:0%
basically does this mean and I believe
 
00:49:34.609 --> 00:49:34.619 align:start position:0%
you've already touched on it
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
that if a firefighter is diagnosed with
 
00:49:37.079 --> 00:49:38.270 align:start position:0%
that if a firefighter is diagnosed with
cancer

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
it is assumed
 
00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
that that is a workman's compensation
 
00:49:42.359 --> 00:49:44.450 align:start position:0%
that that is a workman's compensation
compensation

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.430 align:start position:0%
compensation
claim

00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
claim
 
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
unless workers compensation
 
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
can prove it isn't by isn't isn't job
 
00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:53.690 align:start position:0%
can prove it isn't by isn't isn't job
related

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
related
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
correct so under current statute
 
00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:00.500 align:start position:0%
there is the presumption that a
 
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
definitive number of cancers
 
00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.089 align:start position:0%
definitive number of cancers
are

00:50:05.089 --> 00:50:05.099 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
occupationally caused
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
and with that in order to debunk that
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
the insurance provider would have to
 
00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
um show that that was not occupationally
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
caused maybe that's as simple as digging
 
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
into medical records to find that
 
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
someone is a pack a day smoker
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
um so that part of the statute would not
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
change it would just be inclusive of all
 
00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.130 align:start position:0%
change it would just be inclusive of all
cancers

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
cancers
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh you're welcome
 
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
okay representative O'Brien
 
00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh thank you
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
brother for taking my question
 
00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
um I know when the fire service was
 
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
supposed to be Jacks of all trades and
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
master all of them you know uh so I'm
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
gonna get into the pieces a little bit
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
here uh is that really relevant to this
 
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
Bill yes yes it is okay thank you
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
because the thing is I want to committee
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
to understand me Madam chair uh when
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
Dupont invented the Nomex and it came
 
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
out it was a boon to the industry we all
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
bought into it it was uh uh gonna you
 
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
know save us from getting burnt uh and
 
00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
thermal Burns and everything
 
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
but many uh departments do have a policy
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
that firefighters must wear the
 
00:51:33.049 --> 00:51:33.059 align:start position:0%
protective clothing before you know
 
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
going teams or two and everything
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
there's no other choice that is out
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
there for our firefighters to put on
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
this jacket or you know impregnated
 
00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
material with what we come now to
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
understand the pifas uh that is harmful
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
to us am I correct and assuming that
 
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative you're correct
 
00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
and and we don't I think it's worth
 
00:51:56.569 --> 00:51:56.579 align:start position:0%
noting we don't just wear that
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
protective Ensemble for structural fires
 
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
we're expected to uh and required to
 
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
wear them for uh motor vehicle accidents
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
hazardous materials events
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
um any uh poor weather events because it
 
00:52:15.049 --> 00:52:15.059 align:start position:0%
has reflective material on it
 
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
um so in most cases when we go out on a
 
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:20.220 align:start position:0%
call we're required to wear that gear
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
and representative Simon
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam I'm assuming that this
 
00:52:28.609 --> 00:52:28.619 align:start position:0%
is going to come to my subcommittee so I
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that I have the
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
relevant data
 
00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:34.740 align:start position:0%
um following on representative O'Brien's
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
question is that statutorily required or
 
00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:40.460 align:start position:0%
the fire departments themselves require
 
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your question uh fire
 
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
fire departments require it it's not in
 
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:48.300 align:start position:0%
statute okay and a quick follow-up
 
00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:49.430 align:start position:0%
statute okay and a quick follow-up
follow-up

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
um the other question that I had for you
 
00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:51.650 align:start position:0%
um the other question that I had for you
is

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:52:54.049 --> 00:52:54.059 align:start position:0%
do other groups have access to workman's
 
00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
comp for cancer related incidences I'm
 
00:53:00.109 --> 00:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
thinking about like minors who also have
 
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
high exposure to cancer or even nail
 
00:53:05.809 --> 00:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
salon workers tend to have a very above
 
00:53:05.819 --> 00:53:07.069 align:start position:0%
salon workers tend to have a very above
average

00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
average
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
um exposure to cancer
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
um do you know whether this would is
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
unique to the fire department or do
 
00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:16.140 align:start position:0%
other high-risk
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
jobs also have access to workman's comp
 
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
for cancer so I'm unaware of any
 
00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
any other subgroups that have access to
 
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
this coverage I do know that
 
00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:28.730 align:start position:0%
this coverage I do know that
um

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
widely throughout the country
 
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
firefighters have presumptive coverage
 
00:53:36.849 --> 00:53:36.859 align:start position:0%
for cancer
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
that's not to say that there are other
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
groups that are susceptible to it but
 
00:53:44.329 --> 00:53:44.339 align:start position:0%
the research has certainly been there to
 
00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
show that this is no longer anecdotal
 
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
that this is this is real life that
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
we're at a much higher risk okay thank
 
00:53:52.559 --> 00:53:53.750 align:start position:0%
we're at a much higher risk okay thank
you

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.849 align:start position:0%
you
questions

00:53:55.849 --> 00:53:55.859 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much oh sorry
 
00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.549 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much oh sorry
Peter

00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
Peter
 
00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
um so I apologize for being late I was
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
testifying on another bill in another
 
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.530 align:start position:0%
testifying on another bill in another
committee

00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
um but if this issue has been raised
 
00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
already I apologize again but uh several
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
years ago we had an issue with his
 
00:54:21.549 --> 00:54:21.559 align:start position:0%
firefighting foam uh that's been raised
 
00:54:26.569 --> 00:54:26.579 align:start position:0%
it has been raised yes okay uh but I in
 
00:54:29.569 --> 00:54:29.579 align:start position:0%
in the course of uh I'll ask another one
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
then when I was on the Dover City
 
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
Council about 25 years ago I had the
 
00:54:37.849 --> 00:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
opportunity to suit up when we were
 
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
investigating the cut their Council was
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
investigating these infrared cameras
 
00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
that are so helpful in being able to to
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
be able to see even when a room is
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
filled with smoke
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
and I got an opportunity to suit up and
 
00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:55.220 align:start position:0%
I know with a hat the whole thing
 
00:54:59.230 --> 00:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
including the the oxygen tanks I believe
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
that that that's a very constricting uh
 
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
outfit to have one and it's quite heavy
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
so uh are there Alternatives uh to uh to
 
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:13.640 align:start position:0%
the the gear that's currently being worn
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
which are uh safer or
 
00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:21.500 align:start position:0%
uh maybe not as constrictive I know this
 
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
this is this bill is very much about the
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
cancer aspect uh and from what
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
representable Brian's question I did
 
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
hear that you know the mandatory use of
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
this gear uh so
 
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
um could you answer the question I
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
raised thank you representative I will
 
00:55:42.049 --> 00:55:42.059 align:start position:0%
answer this one quickly no
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
there are no alternatives thank you all
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
right all right thank you very much
 
00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:08.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
turn your mic on please
 
00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
here we go uh good morning thank you
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
madam chair members of the committee uh
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
my name is Larry best I represent the
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of Fire Chiefs
 
00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
as the president I'm also the fire chief
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
in the town of Salem uh president real
 
00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:26.579 align:start position:0%
in front of me just spoke he covered a
 
00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
lot of what I would have to say so I'm
 
00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
not going to reiterate a lot of that
 
00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
based upon the time for today however I
 
00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
am here as a representative of New
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Fire Chiefs asking for support
 
00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
on passing Senate Bill 71
 
00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
back in 2018 when Senate Bill 541 was
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
passed that was step one in this step
 
00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
two is what is currently written today
 
00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:55.559 align:start position:0%
in Senate Bill 71 as the next logical
 
00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
step moving it forward for cancer
 
00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
coverage for firefighters
 
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
the risks associated with firefighting
 
00:57:05.569 --> 00:57:05.579 align:start position:0%
they don't end when just the fire is
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
extinguished it's there's a lot that
 
00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
goes with it later on exposures to
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
carcinogens um not only doing the job
 
00:57:17.569 --> 00:57:17.579 align:start position:0%
but that gets in your gear and and as
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien talked about gets
 
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
absorbed into your skin that's a very
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
real thing
 
00:57:26.089 --> 00:57:26.099 align:start position:0%
representative gold I think talked about
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
the types of gases that are created in
 
00:57:34.609 --> 00:57:34.619 align:start position:0%
in these new fires today from when I've
 
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
been doing this job for 31 years as a
 
00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:38.220 align:start position:0%
full-time firefighter another four years
 
00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
on top of that as a volunteer it's
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
completely changed from then and now
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
some of the things that we do towards
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
the end of a fire to determine what
 
00:57:50.329 --> 00:57:50.339 align:start position:0%
level of protective equipment that we
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
need to wear we do air monitoring and we
 
00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
monitor for hydrogen cyanide which is
 
00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
often a gas that we find that has is
 
00:58:01.309 --> 00:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
there because of the products that have
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
burnt during the fire so
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
with that said it is a very real thing
 
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:11.720 align:start position:0%
there are a number of cancers this bill
 
00:58:14.329 --> 00:58:14.339 align:start position:0%
helps expand the coverage for those
 
00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:16.740 align:start position:0%
cancers I think one of the other things
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
here that I'd just like to hit on real
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
quick is there's been quite a bit of
 
00:58:23.329 --> 00:58:23.339 align:start position:0%
discussion about uh early screening and
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
detection and what you can do
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
to try and prevent cancer in my
 
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
department I I've we've had two cases
 
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
that we've lived one I would like to say
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
that it was found because they were
 
00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
searching for cancer but it was actually
 
00:58:42.049 --> 00:58:42.059 align:start position:0%
found early on I'm kind of trying to
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
figure out what the medical situation
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
was but it was still an early detection
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
of cancer that firefighter received
 
00:58:51.289 --> 00:58:51.299 align:start position:0%
treatment and is continued on the job
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
today the second case and we're on we
 
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
weren't as fortunate it was it was very
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
late diagnosis on cancer and
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that firefighter passed
 
00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
away from cancer so I think when you
 
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
talk about the law longevity of
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
firefighters health and wellness the
 
00:59:10.849 --> 00:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
more that we can do for early screening
 
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
to determine if people have cancer
 
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
firefighters have cancer or not that's a
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
huge benefit to this and that's
 
00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:59:20.099 --> 00:59:20.870 align:start position:0%
something that
um

00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
the study commission would would help
 
00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
support and help give that information
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
to us and stuff so quickly just in
 
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
closing like I said uh president real
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
covered a lot of what I was going to
 
00:59:33.289 --> 00:59:33.299 align:start position:0%
talk about uh the New Hampshire
 
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
Association of Fire Chiefs we
 
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that you vote to
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
pass Senate Bill 71 since it will help
 
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
those who receive a cancer diagnosis
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
while enabling the commission to develop
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
a more effective plan for early
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
detection of cancer in the future I'd be
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:59:59.690 --> 00:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
representative Gould
 
01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
knowing what I stated earlier I live in
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
a house that was built in 1827 it has no
 
01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
chemicals in it my carpets are all wool
 
01:00:16.609 --> 01:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
my curtains are all cotton or wool I
 
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
don't have any synthetic fibers in my
 
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
home my question to you is
 
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
knowing what we know what alternatives
 
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
and why
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
why do firemen put on cancer producing
 
01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:32.339 align:start position:0%
clothing every day I think that many of
 
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
us sitting here are trying to understand
 
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
why we would have to study like isn't
 
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
prevention better than early detection
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand and I want to
 
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
be supportive so thank you for your
 
01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:45.289 align:start position:0%
be supportive so thank you for your
question

01:00:45.289 --> 01:00:45.299 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:00:47.569 --> 01:00:47.579 align:start position:0%
um as far as what can be done and
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
talking about Furnishings in particular
 
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
and and construction of houses that one
 
01:00:54.490 --> 01:00:54.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that that's a
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
industry-wide question that would have
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
to be dealt with that's above me
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
um as far as what can be done for
 
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
prevention on uh firefighters and and
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
reducing the risk of cancer we try and
 
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
do as much as we can with
 
01:01:11.329 --> 01:01:11.339 align:start position:0%
decontamination and washing when we
 
01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:14.339 align:start position:0%
return from calls but it's not 100
 
01:01:17.089 --> 01:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
percent as far as I've there's been a
 
01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
few questions about alternatives to the
 
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
type of gear that we wear there are not
 
01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
any alternatives to the type of gear
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
that we wear right now I'm sure there's
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
there's studies that are going on but
 
01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
right now there is no other choice
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you madam chair
 
01:01:36.119 --> 01:01:37.670 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you madam chair
so

01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
um what is the benefit like if you know
 
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
you're putting clothing on it's going to
 
01:01:44.089 --> 01:01:44.099 align:start position:0%
create cancer uh representative Gould
 
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
the advantage is that keeps you from
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
getting burnt to death
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
and that's what I wanted to hear I don't
 
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
think we've heard enough of that we've
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about what the damage it
 
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
does I don't think we've heard clearly
 
01:01:58.370 --> 01:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
stated one I'm sure if I can help I'll
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
be glad to speak to the commission about
 
01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
the committee about that because this is
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
something that I was involved with in my
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
previous life and one of the reasons why
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
firefighters wear this gear is because
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
it is the only thing that protects them
 
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
from getting burned
 
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
all right so we can talk about that but
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's not something that people
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
voluntarily do okay thank you but
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
without the gear we can't do our job we
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
can't go in the fires because the smoke
 
01:02:27.049 --> 01:02:27.059 align:start position:0%
and the Heat and we get burnt thank you
 
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
very much that was important to be said
 
01:02:30.549 --> 01:02:30.559 align:start position:0%
I think yes
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
chair once again just for clarification
 
01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
so obviously the reason for wearing the
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
gear into a fire I mean it seems pretty
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
self-evident but it sounded like
 
01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
um firefighters also wear it to a bunch
 
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
of other kinds of calls is that correct
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
or is it just a fire so so there are
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
other types of calls um uh the president
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
real uh touched on a couple of those
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
would be a motor vehicle accident
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
um you wear it typically during a motor
 
01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
vehicle accident
 
01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
um sometimes you're not sure like if
 
01:02:59.809 --> 01:02:59.819 align:start position:0%
there's spilled gasoline if there may be
 
01:03:02.329 --> 01:03:02.339 align:start position:0%
a flash fire um so you need to have that
 
01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
protective gear because of that there
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
may be a technical rescue incident where
 
01:03:08.089 --> 01:03:08.099 align:start position:0%
there could be a flammable atmosphere so
 
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
you would need to wear your gear then
 
01:03:14.809 --> 01:03:14.819 align:start position:0%
um we we try to limit in the sense of
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
not wearing it all the time but
 
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
obviously if we're in a situation where
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
there's a flammable atmosphere or
 
01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
something and we're concerned that there
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
could be a fire then we would need to
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
wear the gear in those situations and
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
there's a whole array of different
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
scenarios of when that would occur
 
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you okay other
 
01:03:34.849 --> 01:03:34.859 align:start position:0%
questions representative shua thank you
 
01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair is it not true also that if
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
you're responding to say an automobile
 
01:03:44.569 --> 01:03:44.579 align:start position:0%
accident uh this these uh turnout codes
 
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
include reflective gear that protect you
 
01:03:49.849 --> 01:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
from being hit by another vehicle that's
 
01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:53.180 align:start position:0%
passing by that is correct the gear does
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
have reflective striping on it to help
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
give us visibility when we're out in the
 
01:04:01.329 --> 01:04:01.339 align:start position:0%
street we also do try and wear
 
01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
reflective vests similar to what you
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
would see a construction worker wear as
 
01:04:07.789 --> 01:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
well so in cases when we can do that and
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
it's safe and we're not in a flammable
 
01:04:11.569 --> 01:04:11.579 align:start position:0%
atmosphere that gives us an alternative
 
01:04:14.690 --> 01:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
to maintain that reflectiveness so we
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
can people can see us when we're in the
 
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.210 align:start position:0%
can people can see us when we're in the
street

01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
street
 
01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other representative
 
01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:20.930 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other representative
Schmidt

01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
Schmidt
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
I had occasion back when I lived in
 
01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
Chicago about 45 years ago to be in a
 
01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
neighboring apartment building where
 
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
there had been an apartment fire now the
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
fire fighters had knocked down the fire
 
01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
without the building being destroyed but
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh the apartment itself was a you have
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
lots of experience the apartment itself
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
was the owners was really terrible so my
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
question is how much does the
 
01:04:54.049 --> 01:04:54.059 align:start position:0%
respiratory deer that you wear a
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
protective against because you have the
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
oxygen and but so there must be filters
 
01:05:02.569 --> 01:05:02.579 align:start position:0%
and so forth how how much danger are you
 
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
still exposed to from the
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
the chemicals that are produced by the
 
01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:08.390 align:start position:0%
the chemicals that are produced by the
fire

01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
fire
 
01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question uh so as
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
long as we're wearing our self-contained
 
01:05:14.349 --> 01:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
breathing apparatus respiratory wise
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
we're self-contained we we have our air
 
01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
with us we're good there
 
01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
um it's a matter of it's not only the
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
respiratory part it's the absorption
 
01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
part Through Your Skin there's been a
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
number of studies that have shown the
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
absorption of the the carcinogens
 
01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
through the through your skin there was
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
a several firefighters out of Rhode
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
Island I believe is Providence the
 
01:05:38.329 --> 01:05:38.339 align:start position:0%
entire engine company four people had
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
cancer all in this area because it was
 
01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
absorbed through the skin so if we wear
 
01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
our respiratory wise as long as we have
 
01:05:47.930 --> 01:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
our self-contained breathing apparatus
 
01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
on at the time we're good absorption is
 
01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
another component of this and then
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
there's also the component where I
 
01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:56.339 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier when we go into the
 
01:05:58.849 --> 01:05:58.859 align:start position:0%
overhaul phase of a fire where the the
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
main body of fire is knocked down we
 
01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
have to go in and overhaul it make sure
 
01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
it's completely out there's still
 
01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
off-gassing that goal that is going on
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
at that point we do try and take
 
01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
measures to protect ourselves
 
01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
respiratory wise and that's where some
 
01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
of the air monitoring comes in at that
 
01:06:18.289 --> 01:06:18.299 align:start position:0%
point again but it's not a 100 percent
 
01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
given that we're able to protect
 
01:06:20.099 --> 01:06:21.230 align:start position:0%
given that we're able to protect
ourselves

01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you are there
 
01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
all right I don't see any thank you for
 
01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.049 --> 01:06:42.059 align:start position:0%
most people don't uh correct it when
 
01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
they say Melissa thank you madam chair
 
01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
um members of um good morning everyone
 
01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
my name is Marissa Chase I represent the
 
01:06:49.609 --> 01:06:49.619 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association for justice
 
01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
which is a euphemism for the trial
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
lawyers we're here in support of Senate
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 71
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
um just requesting one little change
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
that I spoke to the medical society and
 
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
uh president rill about
 
01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
um on page one line 25
 
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
um Jay an attorney appointed by the New
 
01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:08.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medical Society we would
 
01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that be changed to
 
01:07:11.329 --> 01:07:11.339 align:start position:0%
appointed by the New Hampshire
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
Association for justice should this bill
 
01:07:16.329 --> 01:07:16.339 align:start position:0%
move forward that's in line with 2018
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 553 which established an
 
01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:22.460 align:start position:0%
oversight commission to look into
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
incidents of PTSD and workers comp part
 
01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
of our organization includes a large and
 
01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
active workers comp peer group where our
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
members represent claimants in workers
 
01:07:38.650 --> 01:07:38.660 align:start position:0%
comp claims and I think that
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge base would be be really

questions
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you that might be helpful it is
 
01:08:01.569 --> 01:08:01.579 align:start position:0%
going to subcommittee
 
01:08:05.089 --> 01:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan thank you
 
01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:08.579 align:start position:0%
yes uh as you've been I thank you for
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question as you've been
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
following this this uh legislation
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
through the process uh do you are you
 
01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:18.980 align:start position:0%
confused or
 
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
concerned that this wasn't taken up by
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
the senate in the in its HHS role and it
 
01:08:29.530 --> 01:08:29.540 align:start position:0%
ended up in the in the Edna uh
 
01:08:33.289 --> 01:08:33.299 align:start position:0%
role for the senator and house that I'm
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
a little confused as to why this didn't
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
get uh managed to the HHS uh with with
 
01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
the ex with the expertise is probably
 
01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:43.370 align:start position:0%
the ex with the expertise is probably
greater

01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
greater
 
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe that's her
 
01:08:48.349 --> 01:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
her decision that's the decision of the
 
01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
president of the Senate and the speaker
 
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
of the house as to what committees the
 
01:08:54.289 --> 01:08:54.299 align:start position:0%
bill goes to
 
01:08:56.209 --> 01:08:56.219 align:start position:0%
I I would just note representatives in
 
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
looking at the um the legislative
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
history on 2018 Senate Bill 553 that
 
01:09:02.269 --> 01:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
established the other oversight
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
commission I talked about with workers
 
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
comp and PTSD and First Responders
 
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
um that bill actually went to Commerce
 
01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:09.470 align:start position:0%
um that bill actually went to Commerce
so

01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
we all get to get to the fun of dealing
 
01:09:13.610 --> 01:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
with these things all right are there
 
01:09:16.249 --> 01:09:16.259 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you
 
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
are there any is there anyone else who
 
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on Senate bill 71.
 
01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
all right not seeing any I will close
 
01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
the public hearing and refer this to the
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:22.440 --> 02:02:23.450 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:02:23.450 --> 02:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:29.810 --> 02:02:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:29.820 --> 02:02:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:34.010 --> 02:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie I'm opening the hearing on
 
02:02:37.189 --> 02:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 72.
 
02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chairman
 
02:02:40.370 --> 02:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:02:42.589 --> 02:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
I'm Donna soucy I represent Senate
 
02:02:45.169 --> 02:02:45.179 align:start position:0%
District 18 which is comprised of the
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
town of Litchfield and five Wards in the
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester
 
02:02:51.470 --> 02:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
um I just want to start by giving you a
 
02:02:53.770 --> 02:02:53.780 align:start position:0%
little context about this bill because
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
it did go to the Senate Edna committee
 
02:03:00.050 --> 02:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
but it's not the typical credentialing
 
02:03:01.970 --> 02:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
or licensing issue that this committee
 
02:03:04.370 --> 02:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
deals with because it's not the state or
 
02:03:06.050 --> 02:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
government entity that's doing the
 
02:03:08.209 --> 02:03:08.219 align:start position:0%
licensing in this case it's
 
02:03:11.390 --> 02:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
credentialing by insurers
 
02:03:16.870 --> 02:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
so with that context Senate Bill 72
 
02:03:19.609 --> 02:03:19.619 align:start position:0%
proposes to make minor changes to the
 
02:03:21.410 --> 02:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
provider credentialing verification
 
02:03:24.290 --> 02:03:24.300 align:start position:0%
procedures that are required by law for
 
02:03:27.050 --> 02:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
Health Care carriers uh to follow when
 
02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
credentialing Health Care Professionals
 
02:03:33.649 --> 02:03:33.659 align:start position:0%
72 attempts to avoid delays in patients
 
02:03:36.890 --> 02:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
seeking care when their provider is only
 
02:03:39.770 --> 02:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
changing their office location or making
 
02:03:42.050 --> 02:03:42.060 align:start position:0%
a change in practice ownership
 
02:03:44.510 --> 02:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
this bill would not change any
 
02:03:46.970 --> 02:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
requirements to notify the carrier of
 
02:03:49.370 --> 02:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
these changes it just ensures that
 
02:03:51.470 --> 02:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
there's no disruption in the network
 
02:03:54.169 --> 02:03:54.179 align:start position:0%
participation status of a credentialed
 
02:03:56.330 --> 02:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
provider with the carrier
 
02:03:58.250 --> 02:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 72 also gives the
 
02:04:00.649 --> 02:04:00.659 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Insurance Authority it
 
02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
would have given him authority to
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
resolve disputes but essentially what we
 
02:04:08.810 --> 02:04:08.820 align:start position:0%
want to ensure is that if you or going
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
to a doctor if you have an established
 
02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
relationship with the practice and a
 
02:04:18.169 --> 02:04:18.179 align:start position:0%
change regarding that Physician's
 
02:04:20.589 --> 02:04:20.599 align:start position:0%
relationship with your insurance carrier
 
02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
is made that the insurer make the change
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
promptly or notify the person uh the
 
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
provider of the reason for any delay or
 
02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:34.030 align:start position:0%
provider of the reason for any delay or
inactivity

02:04:34.030 --> 02:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
inactivity
 
02:04:36.410 --> 02:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
if I can give you a more concrete
 
02:04:39.050 --> 02:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
example because I know this sounds a
 
02:04:41.510 --> 02:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's a lot simpler than it sounds but
 
02:04:43.850 --> 02:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
there's individual who had long
 
02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
established relationship with the
 
02:04:49.609 --> 02:04:49.619 align:start position:0%
physician in New Hampshire City and it
 
02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:51.719 align:start position:0%
turned out that the Physicians practice
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
was acquired by a hospital so that's
 
02:04:58.550 --> 02:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
considered a change in ownership it took
 
02:05:02.589 --> 02:05:02.599 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of time for that physician
 
02:05:06.109 --> 02:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
to be recrudentialed so to speak with
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
the provider in the interim the patient
 
02:05:13.729 --> 02:05:13.739 align:start position:0%
was uncertain of whether or not the
 
02:05:15.709 --> 02:05:15.719 align:start position:0%
provider would still be part of their
 
02:05:17.990 --> 02:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
Network and they were on a maintenance
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
drug that required regular blood testing
 
02:05:23.629 --> 02:05:23.639 align:start position:0%
for it to continue the concern was if
 
02:05:26.270 --> 02:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
they did seek the services through their
 
02:05:28.370 --> 02:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
physician and the physician was then
 
02:05:29.810 --> 02:05:29.820 align:start position:0%
deemed to have no longer been part of
 
02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
the network they may have been on the
 
02:05:35.570 --> 02:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
hook for a substantial cost so all this
 
02:05:38.209 --> 02:05:38.219 align:start position:0%
is trying to do is to ensure that
 
02:05:38.219 --> 02:05:39.589 align:start position:0%
is trying to do is to ensure that
providers

02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
providers
 
02:05:39.599 --> 02:05:41.149 align:start position:0%
providers
um

02:05:41.149 --> 02:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
have those requests made in a very
 
02:05:45.770 --> 02:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
timely fashion
 
02:05:47.689 --> 02:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
thank you I
 
02:05:50.689 --> 02:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
on line nine it says the commissioner
 
02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
shall record complaints is that the
 
02:05:55.370 --> 02:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner that is correct
 
02:05:58.729 --> 02:05:58.739 align:start position:0%
Madam chair okay because
 
02:06:01.010 --> 02:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
that's not one of our normal statutes as
 
02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
I said I um I I found it curious when
 
02:06:06.649 --> 02:06:06.659 align:start position:0%
the bill was assigned to Senate Edna and
 
02:06:09.890 --> 02:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
not Commerce and it appears that whoever
 
02:06:11.870 --> 02:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
assigned just followed suit here in the
 
02:06:14.810 --> 02:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
house I you know I certainly
 
02:06:17.089 --> 02:06:17.099 align:start position:0%
seeing the faces around this table and
 
02:06:20.330 --> 02:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
quite certain of competent resolution of
 
02:06:22.669 --> 02:06:22.679 align:start position:0%
the legislation regardless of whether
 
02:06:24.890 --> 02:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
it's here or the Commerce Committee so I
 
02:06:27.290 --> 02:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
would appreciate your consideration and
 
02:06:29.570 --> 02:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
passage of the bill okay thank you are
 
02:06:30.830 --> 02:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
there any questions representative
 
02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:32.089 align:start position:0%
there any questions representative
Schmidt

02:06:32.089 --> 02:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
Schmidt
 
02:06:33.890 --> 02:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:06:37.729 --> 02:06:37.739 align:start position:0%
welcome Senator uh so it says in line
 
02:06:40.970 --> 02:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
nine the commissioner shall accept uh
 
02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
and obviously uh I'm wondering whether
 
02:06:46.669 --> 02:06:46.679 align:start position:0%
that's too specific
 
02:06:46.679 --> 02:06:47.570 align:start position:0%
that's too specific
um

02:06:47.570 --> 02:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:49.729 align:start position:0%
um
because

02:06:49.729 --> 02:06:49.739 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:06:49.739 --> 02:06:50.450 align:start position:0%
because
um

02:06:50.450 --> 02:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
the commissioner ain't going to be the
 
02:06:54.649 --> 02:06:54.659 align:start position:0%
one accepting 99 of the time right it's
 
02:06:58.490 --> 02:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
going to be some one of his subordinates
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
or some specific you know the legal
 
02:07:04.430 --> 02:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
office whatever uh and I'm wondering
 
02:07:06.350 --> 02:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
whether that question was raised in the
 
02:07:09.530 --> 02:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
Senate so the the language on line nine
 
02:07:12.410 --> 02:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
actually is fairly standard throughout
 
02:07:15.530 --> 02:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
the statute Throughout the chapter the
 
02:07:18.050 --> 02:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
commissioner by definition is the
 
02:07:20.570 --> 02:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
individual but also
 
02:07:22.970 --> 02:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
um that language is used fairly
 
02:07:24.589 --> 02:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
consistently I know this is a chapter
 
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
that you don't often do work in but
 
02:07:30.410 --> 02:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
there's also someone here from the
 
02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
Department who could probably further
 
02:07:33.950 --> 02:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
address that because there is a standard
 
02:07:36.410 --> 02:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
complaint procedure for right I think
 
02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
you really answered the question because
 
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
to the degree it's standard language
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's standard language
 
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
02:07:45.410 --> 02:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you man
 
02:08:03.050 --> 02:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
hello I'm Deborah Cates
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
um and I have not spoken before
 
02:08:10.729 --> 02:08:10.739 align:start position:0%
something like this so excuse me but I
 
02:08:12.830 --> 02:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
am a practice manager for Pembroke
 
02:08:15.470 --> 02:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
Wellness Center which is an independent
 
02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:16.490 align:start position:0%
Wellness Center which is an independent
practice

02:08:16.490 --> 02:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
practice
 
02:08:19.070 --> 02:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
who does credentialing and actually the
 
02:08:20.930 --> 02:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
practice was sold to an independent
 
02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
doctor on December 1st I could speak
 
02:08:25.970 --> 02:08:25.980 align:start position:0%
passionately on this bill because I am
 
02:08:27.470 --> 02:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
in the process of trying to credential
 
02:08:29.689 --> 02:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
the position that purchased the practice
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
it is April
 
02:08:34.729 --> 02:08:34.739 align:start position:0%
and she is still not credentialed with
 
02:08:39.129 --> 02:08:39.139 align:start position:0%
some insurances due to the fact with
 
02:08:44.450 --> 02:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
delays on that with inability to get
 
02:08:46.669 --> 02:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
um some insurances to correspond with me
 
02:08:48.649 --> 02:08:48.659 align:start position:0%
in a timely manner this particular
 
02:08:51.410 --> 02:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
physician just moved over from the
 
02:08:53.810 --> 02:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
Concord area to the one town over
 
02:08:56.149 --> 02:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
basically she was already credentialed
 
02:08:57.770 --> 02:08:57.780 align:start position:0%
with insurances and I have one
 
02:08:59.629 --> 02:08:59.639 align:start position:0%
particular one and I won't I guess I
 
02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
can't name names but literally I can
 
02:09:05.629 --> 02:09:05.639 align:start position:0%
only email this one I call the provider
 
02:09:07.609 --> 02:09:07.619 align:start position:0%
representative and I'm told that there
 
02:09:09.530 --> 02:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
is no credentialing department or no
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
representative I can speak to I can only
 
02:09:15.290 --> 02:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
email and I email an email and I can't
 
02:09:17.450 --> 02:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
get anywhere to credential this does
 
02:09:19.129 --> 02:09:19.139 align:start position:0%
affect patients which would be people
 
02:09:22.129 --> 02:09:22.139 align:start position:0%
like yourself who I was told I started
 
02:09:23.930 --> 02:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
October 21st to credential her because
 
02:09:25.490 --> 02:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
she was purchasing the practice December
 
02:09:28.250 --> 02:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
1st because my husband retired
 
02:09:28.260 --> 02:09:29.030 align:start position:0%
1st because my husband retired
um

02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:31.609 --> 02:09:31.619 align:start position:0%
and these patients were seen in December
 
02:09:33.890 --> 02:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
their bill still is not paid they are on
 
02:09:35.510 --> 02:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
the hook for the bill they were
 
02:09:37.609 --> 02:09:37.619 align:start position:0%
previously our patient this is like a
 
02:09:41.209 --> 02:09:41.219 align:start position:0%
snowballing effect so it is you know she
 
02:09:42.589 --> 02:09:42.599 align:start position:0%
was credentialed with this particular
 
02:09:45.290 --> 02:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
insurance company previously and is now
 
02:09:47.649 --> 02:09:47.659 align:start position:0%
not credentialed even though I was told
 
02:09:51.649 --> 02:09:51.659 align:start position:0%
December October 21st I sent the email I
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
got a thing back saying if we need any
 
02:09:55.729 --> 02:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
more information from you we'll let you
 
02:09:55.739 --> 02:09:56.629 align:start position:0%
more information from you we'll let you
know

02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:09:58.129 --> 02:09:58.139 align:start position:0%
I didn't
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't need any more information to
 
02:10:01.129 --> 02:10:01.139 align:start position:0%
my knowledge because they didn't say we
 
02:10:02.689 --> 02:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
needed anything so I thought she was all
 
02:10:06.109 --> 02:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
set patients were seen December 1st
 
02:10:08.270 --> 02:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
I got paid by said insurance company
 
02:10:10.729 --> 02:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
from some of the plans so I thought all
 
02:10:12.890 --> 02:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
of the plans were all set apparently not
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
all the plans are all set this one
 
02:10:17.089 --> 02:10:17.099 align:start position:0%
particular plan where I'm not being paid
 
02:10:19.970 --> 02:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
on it affects about six patients and I
 
02:10:23.149 --> 02:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
cannot speak to a representative so I
 
02:10:25.070 --> 02:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
have spent calling the insurance
 
02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner last week I have been at my
 
02:10:29.810 --> 02:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
wit's end because I can't talk to a live
 
02:10:33.410 --> 02:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
body to get this doctor credentialed so
 
02:10:35.810 --> 02:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
I mean I would love this to be passed
 
02:10:38.810 --> 02:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
because 30 days is reasonable for a
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
doctor that is already credentialed with
 
02:10:44.089 --> 02:10:44.099 align:start position:0%
the insurance company previously all she
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:49.790 --> 02:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
well thank you for sharing that that
 
02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
horrifying story and I'm I'm glad it is
 
02:10:55.490 --> 02:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
only one Insurance some plans that one
 
02:10:57.410 --> 02:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
insurance company that are quite this
 
02:10:59.870 --> 02:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
bad I would hope that most of them are
 
02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:01.010 align:start position:0%
bad I would hope that most of them are
better

02:11:01.010 --> 02:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
I'm dealing with four that she is still
 
02:11:07.390 --> 02:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
not credentialed with it is not just one
 
02:11:09.970 --> 02:11:09.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying I'm
 
02:11:12.189 --> 02:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
sufficiently uh
 
02:11:15.050 --> 02:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
impressed by your your diligence
 
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative blackis
 
02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
so I guess if let's say this uh this
 
02:11:26.689 --> 02:11:26.699 align:start position:0%
becomes law and a problem like this
 
02:11:30.530 --> 02:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
reoccurs or this one continues I suppose
 
02:11:32.570 --> 02:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
um so it sounds like the remedy would be
 
02:11:35.209 --> 02:11:35.219 align:start position:0%
a complaint to the insurance insurance
 
02:11:35.219 --> 02:11:36.890 align:start position:0%
a complaint to the insurance insurance
commissioner

02:11:36.890 --> 02:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:11:38.810 --> 02:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm not familiar again with
 
02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
how the insurance commissioner works in
 
02:11:43.070 --> 02:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
the whole department what what kind of
 
02:11:45.229 --> 02:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
action can they and are they likely to
 
02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
take that would actually fix this
 
02:11:50.450 --> 02:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
problem uh we have a representative from
 
02:11:52.669 --> 02:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
the commissioner who will be speaking to
 
02:11:55.010 --> 02:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
us later withdraw the question for the
 
02:11:55.020 --> 02:11:56.510 align:start position:0%
us later withdraw the question for the
moment

02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
moment
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:12:02.089 --> 02:12:02.099 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
02:12:08.410 --> 02:12:08.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:10.729 --> 02:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
could we have the spelling of the last
 
02:12:13.550 --> 02:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
witness's last name
 
02:12:18.729 --> 02:12:18.739 align:start position:0%

Association is in strong support of
 
02:12:50.030 --> 02:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 72 and we do appreciate
 
02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie sponsoring this bill as
 
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
well as all the co-sponsors with
 
02:12:57.550 --> 02:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support this bill as stated
 
02:12:59.629 --> 02:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
amends the provider credentialing
 
02:13:02.290 --> 02:13:02.300 align:start position:0%
statute under the insurance statute RSA
 
02:13:06.589 --> 02:13:06.599 align:start position:0%
420j and again just slightly as Senator
 
02:13:09.890 --> 02:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
soucy um has indicated and again I will
 
02:13:11.810 --> 02:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
not read my testimony because you have
 
02:13:13.750 --> 02:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
it it is
 
02:13:16.729 --> 02:13:16.739 align:start position:0%
again ensuring that the patients do not
 
02:13:19.129 --> 02:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
experience unnecessary delays as Miss
 
02:13:22.129 --> 02:13:22.139 align:start position:0%
Cates just identified that is really
 
02:13:24.109 --> 02:13:24.119 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to resolve and our
 
02:13:27.530 --> 02:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
hospitals own many practices and as
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie said they go maybe from
 
02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
One hospital practice to a different
 
02:13:34.490 --> 02:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
hospital little practice and but they
 
02:13:37.970 --> 02:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
remain credentialed or in network those
 
02:13:39.830 --> 02:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals are still in network with the
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
carriers so these are not complex fully
 
02:13:46.609 --> 02:13:46.619 align:start position:0%
credentialed processes these are pretty
 
02:13:49.310 --> 02:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
straightforward and again I think um
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
Miss Cates did a really good job of
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
explaining in um in in reality what
 
02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
actually happens and the problem is the
 
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
patients are caught in the middle and
 
02:14:01.129 --> 02:14:01.139 align:start position:0%
that's what we are trying to resolve so
 
02:14:03.229 --> 02:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
the bill that you have in front of you
 
02:14:05.390 --> 02:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
was amended we did work with the
 
02:14:08.089 --> 02:14:08.099 align:start position:0%
Department of Insurance as well as the
 
02:14:10.430 --> 02:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
carriers I know that they're here I
 
02:14:13.850 --> 02:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
don't know if they plan to speak but my
 
02:14:16.010 --> 02:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
understanding is that everyone was in
 
02:14:18.410 --> 02:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
agreement with the language as
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
as amended in the Senate and we are
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
appreciative of their engagement and
 
02:14:28.189 --> 02:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
willingness to to amend the bill and I
 
02:14:30.109 --> 02:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
am happy to answer any questions but I
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
do um strongly support this bill and
 
02:14:34.669 --> 02:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
hope you will as well thank you thank
 
02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions
 
02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:39.229 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions
representative

02:14:39.229 --> 02:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:14:41.149 --> 02:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
Madam chair thank you I have a legit
 
02:14:43.490 --> 02:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
logistical question how come this would
 
02:14:47.209 --> 02:14:47.219 align:start position:0%
be in a FN Bill Financial like where's
 
02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
where's that tied to I didn't understand
 
02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:51.830 align:start position:0%
where's that tied to I didn't understand
that

02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh because
 
02:14:58.010 --> 02:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
somebody got who was involved thought
 
02:14:59.510 --> 02:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
that it might cause the insurance
 
02:15:02.990 --> 02:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
department a lot of trouble and expense
 
02:15:05.149 --> 02:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
apparently the insurance department
 
02:15:07.490 --> 02:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
responded to the request for fiscal note
 
02:15:10.490 --> 02:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
saying no problem
 
02:15:14.270 --> 02:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
it's that's not that uncommon
 
02:15:17.450 --> 02:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else
 
02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you thank
 
02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:20.209 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you thank
you

02:15:20.209 --> 02:15:20.219 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:15:26.810 --> 02:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:31.149 --> 02:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:34.250 --> 02:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
turn your mic on please
 
02:15:35.990 --> 02:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
there you go oh
 
02:15:38.810 --> 02:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
there we go thank you madam chair my
 
02:15:41.089 --> 02:15:41.099 align:start position:0%
name is Alex Feld Babel I'm an insurance
 
02:15:43.069 --> 02:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
company examiner with the insurance
 
02:15:45.410 --> 02:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
department and part of my responsibility
 
02:15:48.609 --> 02:15:48.619 align:start position:0%
is to address
 
02:15:52.209 --> 02:15:52.219 align:start position:0%
legislation and legislative committees
 
02:15:57.290 --> 02:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
on various Health Care issues so this
 
02:15:59.209 --> 02:15:59.219 align:start position:0%
insurance department has no position on
 
02:16:01.310 --> 02:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
this billboard we were very comfortable
 
02:16:03.010 --> 02:16:03.020 align:start position:0%
with the language
 
02:16:05.930 --> 02:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
that as it has been amended by the
 
02:16:10.510 --> 02:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
Senate I had proposed a certain language
 
02:16:14.209 --> 02:16:14.219 align:start position:0%
and that is incorporated here
 
02:16:14.219 --> 02:16:15.229 align:start position:0%
and that is incorporated here
um

02:16:15.229 --> 02:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:18.530 --> 02:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
the one question that came from the
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
committee was what is
 
02:16:22.609 --> 02:16:22.619 align:start position:0%
um the process that the insurance
 
02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner would use for enforcement
 
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
if there's a violation essentially the
 
02:16:31.069 --> 02:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
issue is
 
02:16:33.770 --> 02:16:33.780 align:start position:0%
um violation of the timeliness standards
 
02:16:36.530 --> 02:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
for processing these credentialing
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
applications and it's 30 days for
 
02:16:41.330 --> 02:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians and 45 days for
 
02:16:41.340 --> 02:16:43.549 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians and 45 days for
specialists

02:16:43.549 --> 02:16:43.559 align:start position:0%
specialists
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
um and uh it's our experience that we I
 
02:16:50.690 --> 02:16:50.700 align:start position:0%
mean we already receive a fair number of
 
02:16:52.490 --> 02:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
complaints from Health Care Providers
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
about untimely processing of
 
02:16:58.250 --> 02:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
credentialing applications and the
 
02:17:01.490 --> 02:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
department even put out a bulletin to
 
02:17:06.349 --> 02:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
carriers last year to remind them of The
 
02:17:08.690 --> 02:17:08.700 align:start position:0%
Importance of Being in compliance with
 
02:17:10.129 --> 02:17:10.139 align:start position:0%
the timeliness standards for
 
02:17:12.770 --> 02:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
credentialing especially these days when
 
02:17:14.209 --> 02:17:14.219 align:start position:0%
there is
 
02:17:14.219 --> 02:17:14.810 align:start position:0%
there is
um

02:17:14.810 --> 02:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
a crisis in access to Providers
 
02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
especially certain kinds of providers
 
02:17:22.030 --> 02:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
like Mental Health Providers
 
02:17:25.389 --> 02:17:25.399 align:start position:0%
nurses and and others it's important
 
02:17:28.190 --> 02:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
when there are providers who are
 
02:17:31.009 --> 02:17:31.019 align:start position:0%
available to get them credentialed
 
02:17:31.019 --> 02:17:32.349 align:start position:0%
available to get them credentialed
properly

02:17:32.349 --> 02:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
properly
 
02:17:34.549 --> 02:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
there was also
 
02:17:34.559 --> 02:17:35.570 align:start position:0%
there was also
um

02:17:35.570 --> 02:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:36.889 align:start position:0%
um
what

02:17:36.889 --> 02:17:36.899 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:17:38.870 --> 02:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
oh just the question about the reference
 
02:17:41.450 --> 02:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner it's uh that's
 
02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
typical knowledge statutes it's um like
 
02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
Louis XIV Leta Samoa
 
02:17:51.889 --> 02:17:51.899 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner is the department
 
02:17:54.530 --> 02:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
um and that's just the way all all of
 
02:17:57.049 --> 02:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
title 37 is worded
 
02:17:59.629 --> 02:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
um just a little bit of context I think
 
02:18:01.389 --> 02:18:01.399 align:start position:0%
might also help here
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
this law for 20 J
 
02:18:08.870 --> 02:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
um is a model law developed through the
 
02:18:10.009 --> 02:18:10.019 align:start position:0%
National Association of insurance
 
02:18:11.810 --> 02:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and it's in place in many
 
02:18:14.570 --> 02:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
states it came about in order to address
 
02:18:17.929 --> 02:18:17.939 align:start position:0%
the regulation of managed care which
 
02:18:20.530 --> 02:18:20.540 align:start position:0%
really came into
 
02:18:23.929 --> 02:18:23.939 align:start position:0%
predominance in the 1990s and Managed
 
02:18:25.969 --> 02:18:25.979 align:start position:0%
Care essentially means health coverage
 
02:18:28.490 --> 02:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
that's offered through a network where
 
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
you the covered person are incentivized
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
or Limited in some way to getting your
 
02:18:37.450 --> 02:18:37.460 align:start position:0%
care from that network of providers
 
02:18:40.849 --> 02:18:40.859 align:start position:0%
and this portion of the law requires
 
02:18:42.530 --> 02:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
Health carriers to make sure that
 
02:18:45.230 --> 02:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
everyone in their network is
 
02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:45.830 align:start position:0%
everyone in their network is
um

02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:47.389 align:start position:0%
um
uh

02:18:47.389 --> 02:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:18:51.230 --> 02:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
qualified to be delivering care to those
 
02:18:53.330 --> 02:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
covered persons so there's a lot that
 
02:18:55.849 --> 02:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
the health care has to do
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
um in this section of Statute they have
 
02:19:00.830 --> 02:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that uh the provider is
 
02:19:04.129 --> 02:19:04.139 align:start position:0%
graduated from professional school
 
02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
um has a license
 
02:19:09.889 --> 02:19:09.899 align:start position:0%
um check the malpractice history check
 
02:19:12.250 --> 02:19:12.260 align:start position:0%
the general practice history
 
02:19:14.870 --> 02:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a list of
 
02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:16.310 align:start position:0%
and there's a list of
about

02:19:16.310 --> 02:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:19:19.969 --> 02:19:19.979 align:start position:0%
13 items that the carrier has to carry
 
02:19:22.849 --> 02:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
out so it's not an easy process and
 
02:19:24.530 --> 02:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of policy discussion
 
02:19:26.629 --> 02:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
over the years over how we can satisfy
 
02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
the on the one hand the need to make
 
02:19:30.770 --> 02:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
sure providers are qualified that are in
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
the network on the other hand to make
 
02:19:35.690 --> 02:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
sure everything is timely done so that
 
02:19:37.790 --> 02:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
our whole healthcare system isn't bogged
 
02:19:40.190 --> 02:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
down so that's been the issue and this
 
02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:42.709 align:start position:0%
down so that's been the issue and this
modification

02:19:42.709 --> 02:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
modification
 
02:19:46.450 --> 02:19:46.460 align:start position:0%
um you know would address that in some
 
02:19:49.849 --> 02:19:49.859 align:start position:0%
limited way and we're also comfortable
 
02:19:52.250 --> 02:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
with the provision that says that the
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner will take
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
complaints from providers and bring
 
02:19:59.210 --> 02:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions
 
02:19:59.220 --> 02:19:59.830 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions
um

02:19:59.830 --> 02:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:03.650 --> 02:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
for violations and we have
 
02:20:06.650 --> 02:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
a whole menu of options when we bring in
 
02:20:09.530 --> 02:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
enforcement action we can conduct what's
 
02:20:11.450 --> 02:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
called a market conduct exam it's like
 
02:20:15.650 --> 02:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
an audit and then have findings from
 
02:20:19.849 --> 02:20:19.859 align:start position:0%
that which could lead to a fine or a
 
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan and continued
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
monitoring so we have
 
02:20:26.640 --> 02:20:27.230 align:start position:0%
monitoring so we have
um

02:20:27.230 --> 02:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:29.810 --> 02:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
sort of a whole menu
 
02:20:31.849 --> 02:20:31.859 align:start position:0%
of options for enforcement including
 
02:20:35.230 --> 02:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately pulling a company's license
 
02:20:39.349 --> 02:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
if they're particularly intransigent
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
so I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
02:20:43.130 --> 02:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
that probably I know a little too long
 
02:20:43.140 --> 02:20:45.349 align:start position:0%
that probably I know a little too long
okay

02:20:45.349 --> 02:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:20:45.359 --> 02:20:46.610 align:start position:0%
okay
Mongolian

02:20:46.610 --> 02:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
Mongolian
 
02:20:49.849 --> 02:20:49.859 align:start position:0%
thank you you mentioned a 30 days and 45
 
02:20:52.130 --> 02:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
days but the bill I see before us only
 
02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
has 30 days so
 
02:20:57.050 --> 02:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
yeah the um
 
02:20:59.870 --> 02:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
I think what it is
 
02:20:59.880 --> 02:21:01.490 align:start position:0%
I think what it is
um

02:21:01.490 --> 02:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:01.500 --> 02:21:02.950 align:start position:0%
um
is

02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:21:04.990 --> 02:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
the original
 
02:21:07.610 --> 02:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
application has to be processed in 30
 
02:21:09.710 --> 02:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
days of your primary care provider and
 
02:21:12.290 --> 02:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
within 45 if you're a specialist but
 
02:21:14.570 --> 02:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
then if you have to be recrudentialed
 
02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
because of an event such as you're
 
02:21:19.790 --> 02:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
bought out by another practice then that
 
02:21:22.670 --> 02:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
deadline is 30 days ah thank you
 
02:21:25.550 --> 02:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
represent goalie
 
02:21:28.490 --> 02:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:21:30.410 --> 02:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:21:33.410 --> 02:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
issues we're having with health care and
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
finding enough practitioners in that
 
02:21:39.950 --> 02:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
can you tell me why
 
02:21:42.590 --> 02:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
it would take so long to credential
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
someone if they're just moving from one
 
02:21:46.429 --> 02:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
practice to another if they're already
 
02:21:49.370 --> 02:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
in network why does it take so long to
 
02:21:51.410 --> 02:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
the providers say oh we're already
 
02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
covering them under this health care
 
02:21:52.680 --> 02:21:54.110 align:start position:0%
covering them under this health care
provider

02:21:54.110 --> 02:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
provider
 
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
sure we'll carry along the patients and
 
02:21:58.969 --> 02:21:58.979 align:start position:0%
go over to the next why why is it such a
 
02:22:02.750 --> 02:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
process yeah that's a good question but
 
02:22:05.090 --> 02:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
I think the reason that we're accepting
 
02:22:08.570 --> 02:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
this uh 30-day deadline instead of
 
02:22:11.690 --> 02:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
anything longer is that for
 
02:22:14.750 --> 02:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
recrudentialing it ought to be the case
 
02:22:16.969 --> 02:22:16.979 align:start position:0%
that not
 
02:22:19.969 --> 02:22:19.979 align:start position:0%
the whole you don't have to go down the
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
whole list that you perhaps have already
 
02:22:26.450 --> 02:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
confirmed that this provider is licensed
 
02:22:29.090 --> 02:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
and just because of a change in
 
02:22:29.100 --> 02:22:30.469 align:start position:0%
and just because of a change in
ownership

02:22:30.469 --> 02:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
02:22:32.270 --> 02:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
you know you don't have to recheck that
 
02:22:35.210 --> 02:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
so it it ought to be easier
 
02:22:38.330 --> 02:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:40.490 --> 02:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
so could we shorten the time frame from
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
30 days
 
02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:43.630 align:start position:0%
30 days
um

02:22:43.630 --> 02:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:46.730 --> 02:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
I uh would think it would be important
 
02:22:49.309 --> 02:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
to hear from the industry
 
02:22:51.770 --> 02:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
um on that question before making a
 
02:22:53.389 --> 02:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
decision like that
 
02:22:56.929 --> 02:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
I have a question how often does a
 
02:22:58.790 --> 02:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
provider need to be re-certified
 
02:23:00.889 --> 02:23:00.899 align:start position:0%
assuming no change in address or
 
02:23:02.809 --> 02:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
whatever the statue says every three
 
02:23:02.819 --> 02:23:04.210 align:start position:0%
whatever the statue says every three
years

02:23:04.210 --> 02:23:04.220 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
credentialed yeah
 
02:23:09.530 --> 02:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:23:12.349 --> 02:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
what we've heard from and we just
 
02:23:16.010 --> 02:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
received some testimony about the
 
02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
difficulty or the length of time to get
 
02:23:21.290 --> 02:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
somebody credentialed thinking of it in
 
02:23:22.969 --> 02:23:22.979 align:start position:0%
reverse if you wanted to take away
 
02:23:25.490 --> 02:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
somebody's credentials is it this a
 
02:23:31.309 --> 02:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:33.950 --> 02:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
um I doubt
 
02:23:37.849 --> 02:23:37.859 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm not an expert on the whole
 
02:23:39.170 --> 02:23:39.180 align:start position:0%
credentialing question I have
 
02:23:41.150 --> 02:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
participated over the
 
02:23:44.290 --> 02:23:44.300 align:start position:0%
decades and various committees
 
02:23:46.670 --> 02:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
study committees that looked at the
 
02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:48.050 align:start position:0%
study committees that looked at the
issue

02:23:48.050 --> 02:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:23:48.060 --> 02:23:48.590 align:start position:0%
issue
um

02:23:48.590 --> 02:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:51.650 --> 02:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
so I think I'm qualified enough to say
 
02:23:55.250 --> 02:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
that in that context if you find one
 
02:23:55.260 --> 02:23:56.450 align:start position:0%
that in that context if you find one
issue

02:23:56.450 --> 02:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:23:56.460 --> 02:23:57.349 align:start position:0%
issue
um

02:23:57.349 --> 02:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:01.370 --> 02:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
that is uh indicating that a particular
 
02:24:03.170 --> 02:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
provider should not be credentialed then
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:10.070 --> 02:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah actually you stop when you find the
 
02:24:13.790 --> 02:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
first big problem fair enough okay other
 
02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:15.110 align:start position:0%
first big problem fair enough okay other
questions

02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
02:24:18.889 --> 02:24:18.899 align:start position:0%
thank you madam gee I've got I've got a
 
02:24:20.929 --> 02:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
really complicated question here oh I
 
02:24:23.090 --> 02:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
love those what is it what is a change
 
02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
of status
 
02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:26.090 align:start position:0%
of status
oh

02:24:26.090 --> 02:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:26.870 align:start position:0%
oh
um

02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:30.349 --> 02:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
I think uh
 
02:24:33.469 --> 02:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
the primary example
 
02:24:33.479 --> 02:24:34.250 align:start position:0%
the primary example
um

02:24:34.250 --> 02:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:36.710 --> 02:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
that we've been that gave rise to this
 
02:24:41.690 --> 02:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
bill was an experience with the provider
 
02:24:41.700 --> 02:24:42.770 align:start position:0%
bill was an experience with the provider
um

02:24:42.770 --> 02:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:45.889 --> 02:24:45.899 align:start position:0%
being acquired by another provider
 
02:24:47.809 --> 02:24:47.819 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:24:49.429 --> 02:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
the other
 
02:24:51.710 --> 02:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
um experience that was referred to when
 
02:24:53.389 --> 02:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
this bill was over in the Senate I think
 
02:24:55.300 --> 02:24:55.310 align:start position:0%
is a provider changing location
 
02:24:55.310 --> 02:24:57.130 align:start position:0%
is a provider changing location
[Music]

02:24:57.130 --> 02:24:57.140 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
and taking a look at the
 
02:25:03.410 --> 02:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
location of the practice is an element
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
of what you have to consider in
 
02:25:07.670 --> 02:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
credentialing so those are two examples
 
02:25:10.190 --> 02:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
that I can think of
 
02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
go yes follow up thank you madam chair
 
02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:14.630 align:start position:0%
go yes follow up thank you madam chair
so

02:25:14.630 --> 02:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:18.889 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:25:18.889 --> 02:25:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:23.330 --> 02:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
if Dr true uh Works uh in his own
 
02:25:25.730 --> 02:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
practice in uh
 
02:25:25.740 --> 02:25:27.230 align:start position:0%
practice in uh
Hanover

02:25:27.230 --> 02:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
Hanover
 
02:25:30.770 --> 02:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
and I moved my practice to Manchester
 
02:25:32.770 --> 02:25:32.780 align:start position:0%
I would probably have to get re
 
02:25:35.389 --> 02:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
credentialed from the insurance company
 
02:25:37.370 --> 02:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:25:40.130 --> 02:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
yes I'm thinking that I'm I'm referring
 
02:25:49.250 --> 02:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:52.730 --> 02:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
apparently that was the case of the the
 
02:25:56.090 --> 02:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
person that uh Miss cat Cates talked
 
02:25:59.630 --> 02:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
about that they moved and they had to be
 
02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:01.309 align:start position:0%
about that they moved and they had to be
re-credentialed

02:26:01.309 --> 02:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
re-credentialed
 
02:26:03.469 --> 02:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
if I could follow up just one more thank
 
02:26:06.170 --> 02:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
so if if a doctor in state is moving
 
02:26:10.910 --> 02:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
from point A to point B with a different
 
02:26:13.250 --> 02:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
address they get 30 days to get
 
02:26:13.260 --> 02:26:16.790 align:start position:0%
address they get 30 days to get
reconjentioned

02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:18.889 --> 02:26:18.899 align:start position:0%
how long does it take for a doctor
 
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
coming in from California who know New
 
02:26:23.210 --> 02:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire knows nothing about how long
 
02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
would it take them to get to
 
02:26:24.359 --> 02:26:26.410 align:start position:0%
would it take them to get to
credentialed

02:26:26.410 --> 02:26:26.420 align:start position:0%
credentialed
 
02:26:30.290 --> 02:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
a GP yeah I think it would
 
02:26:33.469 --> 02:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
um I mean the same 30 days deadline
 
02:26:33.479 --> 02:26:34.849 align:start position:0%
um I mean the same 30 days deadline
applies

02:26:34.849 --> 02:26:34.859 align:start position:0%
applies
 
02:26:37.790 --> 02:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schmidt
 
02:26:40.309 --> 02:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair since this seems
 
02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
to be much more of a trend or of the new
 
02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
State of Affairs
 
02:26:49.969 --> 02:26:49.979 align:start position:0%
is this process being improved so that
 
02:26:52.429 --> 02:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
we get a better result in a faster time
 
02:26:55.490 --> 02:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
because you know
 
02:26:57.469 --> 02:26:57.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to be dealing with it seems
 
02:26:59.450 --> 02:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
like even with this statute we're going
 
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
to be dealing with this situation all
 
02:27:04.550 --> 02:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
the time now is that not the case yeah
 
02:27:07.670 --> 02:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
it is the case that it continues to be
 
02:27:10.790 --> 02:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
an important issue the department just
 
02:27:13.309 --> 02:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh concluded
 
02:27:16.270 --> 02:27:16.280 align:start position:0%
um two mental health parity examinations
 
02:27:19.490 --> 02:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh where we're looking at
 
02:27:22.010 --> 02:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
um some of the major carriers in the
 
02:27:23.929 --> 02:27:23.939 align:start position:0%
state and whether they treat health
 
02:27:25.969 --> 02:27:25.979 align:start position:0%
coverage for mental health in parity
 
02:27:29.630 --> 02:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
with medical Surgical and one of the
 
02:27:32.290 --> 02:27:32.300 align:start position:0%
issues in that examination
 
02:27:35.290 --> 02:27:35.300 align:start position:0%
that we focused on was
 
02:27:37.969 --> 02:27:37.979 align:start position:0%
encouraging the carriers to streamline
 
02:27:40.250 --> 02:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
their credentialing process for mental
 
02:27:42.290 --> 02:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
health providers
 
02:27:44.150 --> 02:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:27:47.510 --> 02:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions
 
02:27:49.250 --> 02:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the information
 
02:27:52.370 --> 02:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
and I would hope that the 30 days is a
 
02:27:55.010 --> 02:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
maximum and not a an average because it
 
02:27:56.750 --> 02:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
seems like an awfully long time to
 
02:27:59.450 --> 02:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
process a change of address
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
even the post office does it faster
 
02:28:05.389 --> 02:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
all right I have a card from someone
 
02:28:13.690 --> 02:28:13.700 align:start position:0%

liaison mgma stands for medical group
 
02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
management association we're actually a
 
02:28:40.969 --> 02:28:40.979 align:start position:0%
strictly a volunteer group right now the
 
02:28:43.610 --> 02:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire chapter has about a
 
02:28:46.309 --> 02:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
hundred members we represent primarily
 
02:28:48.770 --> 02:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
physician practices including both
 
02:28:51.950 --> 02:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
hospital and hospital-based practices
 
02:28:55.010 --> 02:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
and there's a National Organization too
 
02:28:58.190 --> 02:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
that actually has about uh sixty
 
02:29:01.070 --> 02:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
thousand Medical Practice administrators
 
02:29:05.050 --> 02:29:05.060 align:start position:0%
and represents 350 000 Physicians
 
02:29:09.170 --> 02:29:09.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm also represent the New Hampshire
 
02:29:12.110 --> 02:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
Medical Society and that I'm on the
 
02:29:14.570 --> 02:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
board of the medical society I am not a
 
02:29:17.929 --> 02:29:17.939 align:start position:0%
doctor as the legislative liaison for
 
02:29:22.309 --> 02:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
mgma and I'm a practice manager I manage
 
02:29:25.490 --> 02:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
a GI practice on the Seacoast that I've
 
02:29:30.110 --> 02:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
done for the last 11 years that has 17
 
02:29:32.330 --> 02:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
providers right now including 11
 
02:29:34.929 --> 02:29:34.939 align:start position:0%
Physicians and
 
02:29:38.570 --> 02:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
physician assistants and nurse
 
02:29:41.690 --> 02:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
practitioners so I'm here wearing Three
 
02:29:44.389 --> 02:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
Hats but I would tell you that all three
 
02:29:46.730 --> 02:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
of these entities have the same concerns
 
02:29:48.110 --> 02:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
that have brought me here and which
 
02:29:51.650 --> 02:29:51.660 align:start position:0%
affect us as well as our patients in
 
02:29:54.110 --> 02:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
many practices are concerned with some
 
02:29:56.990 --> 02:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
ensure responsiveness or lack thereof
 
02:29:59.450 --> 02:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
regarding the subject of this bill
 
02:30:02.150 --> 02:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
and that's responding to us regarding
 
02:30:05.870 --> 02:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
provider updates and additions and to
 
02:30:08.090 --> 02:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
the current requirements of the law and
 
02:30:09.530 --> 02:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
they would we would like to see these
 
02:30:11.450 --> 02:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
changes put in place so that the law
 
02:30:14.330 --> 02:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
would have more teeth to assist us in
 
02:30:17.090 --> 02:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
getting this done uh why is this
 
02:30:19.790 --> 02:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
important to us well when we when we
 
02:30:19.800 --> 02:30:20.830 align:start position:0%
important to us well when we when we
offer

02:30:20.830 --> 02:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
offer
 
02:30:23.889 --> 02:30:23.899 align:start position:0%
Physicians and other providers
 
02:30:27.650 --> 02:30:27.660 align:start position:0%
employment agreements we have to give
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
them we have to give them a lot of
 
02:30:32.809 --> 02:30:32.819 align:start position:0%
notice before they can come on board if
 
02:30:34.670 --> 02:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
they're licensed in New Hampshire we
 
02:30:37.870 --> 02:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
would use 90 to 120 days
 
02:30:41.330 --> 02:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
because of the insurer process if
 
02:30:42.950 --> 02:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
they're not licensed yet in New
 
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have to extend it further
 
02:30:47.150 --> 02:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
so they can get a license with the Board
 
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
of Medicine or the Board of Nursing
 
02:30:52.429 --> 02:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
whichever board so my particular
 
02:30:55.309 --> 02:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
practice when I joined it 11 years ago
 
02:30:58.010 --> 02:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
had about nine Physicians now we have 17
 
02:31:01.790 --> 02:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
providers why have we grown so much it's
 
02:31:04.969 --> 02:31:04.979 align:start position:0%
because there's a need and the GI needs
 
02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
in the state have grown tremendously
 
02:31:10.309 --> 02:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
everybody we have joined us is very very
 
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
busy and if anything the big issue right
 
02:31:16.670 --> 02:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
now is getting patients in to see
 
02:31:19.670 --> 02:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
providers so I think it creates a real
 
02:31:22.190 --> 02:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
deficit in the clinical situation when
 
02:31:24.590 --> 02:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
people can't get in to see you I can
 
02:31:26.630 --> 02:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
tell you as someone who deals with this
 
02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
as a practice manager we have a lot of
 
02:31:32.330 --> 02:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
unhappy patients when they cannot be
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:39.469 --> 02:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
so the insurers
 
02:31:39.479 --> 02:31:40.910 align:start position:0%
so the insurers
um

02:31:40.910 --> 02:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:43.370 --> 02:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
the problem we have and I think I want
 
02:31:45.650 --> 02:31:45.660 align:start position:0%
to emphasize this is not all insurers
 
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
some insurers are very good some
 
02:31:50.330 --> 02:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
insurers if I had a billing person here
 
02:31:52.969 --> 02:31:52.979 align:start position:0%
would tell you are terrible and some are
 
02:31:55.670 --> 02:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
in between so it really varies a lot and
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
all we're looking from them is timely
 
02:32:02.270 --> 02:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
response to our applications for
 
02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:06.660 align:start position:0%
providers and we have people who we send
 
02:32:10.730 --> 02:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
in an application we have to contact
 
02:32:14.450 --> 02:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
them to find out if they received it we
 
02:32:17.090 --> 02:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
have to remind them a couple of weeks
 
02:32:19.190 --> 02:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
later that we haven't heard whether they
 
02:32:22.730 --> 02:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
acknowledge they've received it and the
 
02:32:25.849 --> 02:32:25.859 align:start position:0%
process goes on and on and often we have
 
02:32:28.309 --> 02:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
someone who has to kind of be on top of
 
02:32:31.010 --> 02:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
this to check with a particular insurer
 
02:32:34.309 --> 02:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
to find out where they are because we
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
cannot schedule our new providers within
 
02:32:40.010 --> 02:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
particular insurers until we know that
 
02:32:43.250 --> 02:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
the services are covered by that insurer
 
02:32:47.090 --> 02:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
and um the the I think the key word is
 
02:32:49.610 --> 02:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
it's very very frustrating and it it
 
02:32:53.450 --> 02:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of resources to do that
 
02:32:53.460 --> 02:32:55.130 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of resources to do that
um

02:32:55.130 --> 02:32:55.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:58.010 --> 02:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
another source of frustration is uh
 
02:33:00.410 --> 02:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
timely removal of providers from their
 
02:33:03.290 --> 02:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
roles we I think I'm biased I think our
 
02:33:05.150 --> 02:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
practice does a pretty good job of
 
02:33:07.550 --> 02:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
informing insurers that someone is no
 
02:33:09.889 --> 02:33:09.899 align:start position:0%
longer with us and
 
02:33:13.550 --> 02:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
um we had one uh physician assistant who
 
02:33:18.830 --> 02:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
left us in January of 2020 and about six
 
02:33:21.170 --> 02:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
months ago that one insurer took them
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
off their provided directory and we've
 
02:33:27.410 --> 02:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
had one who left us last January last
 
02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
January who's still on provided
 
02:33:32.929 --> 02:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
directories and why that's negative is
 
02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
because patients call you I'd like to
 
02:33:37.429 --> 02:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
see so and so and we then have to
 
02:33:39.469 --> 02:33:39.479 align:start position:0%
explain to them that that person's no
 
02:33:41.630 --> 02:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
longer with us and you know you get
 
02:33:45.650 --> 02:33:45.660 align:start position:0%
questions and so on and it makes it
 
02:33:47.690 --> 02:33:47.700 align:start position:0%
difficult and they don't typically blame
 
02:33:49.250 --> 02:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
the insurance company for that
 
02:33:53.270 --> 02:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
misinformation they blame the practice
 
02:33:55.370 --> 02:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
um while this bill is very limited in
 
02:33:57.410 --> 02:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
scope and makes one change we're hopeful
 
02:33:59.450 --> 02:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
it's passage by this committee and its
 
02:34:02.929 --> 02:34:02.939 align:start position:0%
enactment will assist by in causing
 
02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
those insurers who do not meet these
 
02:34:07.130 --> 02:34:07.140 align:start position:0%
standards who do a better job of working
 
02:34:09.170 --> 02:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
with providers rather than working
 
02:34:11.330 --> 02:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
against them and I understand part of
 
02:34:13.910 --> 02:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
the problem is Staffing and that
 
02:34:16.309 --> 02:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
insurers have these problems it's a very
 
02:34:19.610 --> 02:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
complex process behind the scene with
 
02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
insurance companies but it also creates
 
02:34:25.610 --> 02:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
a big issue for practices and it creates
 
02:34:28.790 --> 02:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
a big issue for our patients thank you
 
02:34:30.889 --> 02:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
thank you for your information is there
 
02:34:33.650 --> 02:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:37.070 --> 02:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you all right does
 
02:34:39.410 --> 02:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to testify on Senate
 
02:34:44.809 --> 02:34:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:48.110 --> 02:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any of clues of public
 
02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:51.230 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any of clues of public
hearing

02:34:51.230 --> 02:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:34:53.510 --> 02:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:55.429 --> 02:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
does someone wish to make a motion on
 
02:34:57.469 --> 02:34:57.479 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 72
 
02:35:01.130 --> 02:35:01.140 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I'll move OTP on House Bill
 
02:35:09.950 --> 02:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:13.610 --> 02:35:13.620 align:start position:0%
you should speak to your motion yes
 
02:35:16.910 --> 02:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
um being personally familiar with this
 
02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:18.290 align:start position:0%
um being personally familiar with this
process

02:35:18.290 --> 02:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:35:22.130 --> 02:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
and understanding the need for Effective
 
02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
and efficient transfer of
 
02:35:27.170 --> 02:35:27.180 align:start position:0%
credentials when a doctor moves from one
 
02:35:28.969 --> 02:35:28.979 align:start position:0%
practice to the other
 
02:35:31.849 --> 02:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
I think that this bill is um
 
02:35:34.670 --> 02:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
takes care of that and it's unfortunate
 
02:35:37.190 --> 02:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
that we have to do it this way
 
02:35:39.770 --> 02:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
02:35:44.809 --> 02:35:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
first I want to
 
02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:49.250 align:start position:0%
first I want to
probably

02:35:49.250 --> 02:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:35:51.530 --> 02:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
say I'm not sure why this bill is here
 
02:35:53.870 --> 02:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
and representative hunt should be
 
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
thanking our committee for taking some
 
02:35:59.030 --> 02:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
of his workload for the Senate bills
 
02:35:59.040 --> 02:35:59.750 align:start position:0%
of his workload for the Senate bills
um

02:35:59.750 --> 02:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:01.730 --> 02:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
but in reality
 
02:36:05.150 --> 02:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
um it's just I find it
 
02:36:07.490 --> 02:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
appalling that
 
02:36:07.500 --> 02:36:09.050 align:start position:0%
appalling that
hearing

02:36:09.050 --> 02:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:36:11.150 --> 02:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
testimony that it could take up telling
 
02:36:13.190 --> 02:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
their providers it could take up to 120
 
02:36:15.050 --> 02:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
days before they can get into another
 
02:36:17.809 --> 02:36:17.819 align:start position:0%
practice for through credentialing
 
02:36:17.819 --> 02:36:19.429 align:start position:0%
practice for through credentialing
it's

02:36:19.429 --> 02:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:36:21.530 --> 02:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
these individuals from what I'm hearing
 
02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
have already been
 
02:36:25.969 --> 02:36:25.979 align:start position:0%
under the provider care and are just
 
02:36:28.730 --> 02:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
changing either an address or a
 
02:36:28.740 --> 02:36:29.570 align:start position:0%
changing either an address or a
different

02:36:29.570 --> 02:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:36:29.580 --> 02:36:30.770 align:start position:0%
different
practice

02:36:30.770 --> 02:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
practice
 
02:36:33.050 --> 02:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
and to have to take this long to
 
02:36:35.830 --> 02:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
credential someone I find unacceptable
 
02:36:38.990 --> 02:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
and like I said I I wish this was
 
02:36:41.210 --> 02:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
a way to make it shorter than the 30
 
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
days because we are in a health care
 
02:36:45.050 --> 02:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
crisis we need providers here in New
 
02:36:46.730 --> 02:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it shouldn't take this
 
02:36:50.809 --> 02:36:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:50.819 --> 02:36:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
shrimp

02:36:52.910 --> 02:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
shrimp
 
02:36:55.370 --> 02:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
well I certainly second represent
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
goalie's remarks uh and it it's it seems
 
02:37:03.550 --> 02:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
to me that this bill is going to
 
02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:05.770 align:start position:0%
to me that this bill is going to
force

02:37:05.770 --> 02:37:05.780 align:start position:0%
force
 
02:37:08.030 --> 02:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
the process to
 
02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:09.250 align:start position:0%
the process to
to

02:37:09.250 --> 02:37:09.260 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:37:12.110 --> 02:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
react a little bit more rapidly but what
 
02:37:14.750 --> 02:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid is likely to happen is
 
02:37:17.469 --> 02:37:17.479 align:start position:0%
they're going to acknowledge receipt
 
02:37:20.990 --> 02:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
medel developed some kind of a
 
02:37:23.990 --> 02:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
an excuse for why it can't be actually
 
02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:25.490 align:start position:0%
an excuse for why it can't be actually
implemented

02:37:25.490 --> 02:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
02:37:29.870 --> 02:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
I know within the 30 days but but as I
 
02:37:32.270 --> 02:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
think we absolutely have to go forward
 
02:37:35.389 --> 02:37:35.399 align:start position:0%
with this and the hope that it will you
 
02:37:35.399 --> 02:37:36.110 align:start position:0%
with this and the hope that it will you
know

02:37:36.110 --> 02:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:37:38.469 --> 02:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
provide the verbial kick in the
 
02:37:41.450 --> 02:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
proverbial rear end
 
02:37:44.030 --> 02:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schmidt I'd
 
02:37:47.450 --> 02:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
like to agree with that and say that I'm
 
02:37:51.050 --> 02:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
glad the insurance department has a
 
02:37:51.060 --> 02:37:52.969 align:start position:0%
glad the insurance department has a
uh

02:37:52.969 --> 02:37:52.979 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:37:55.849 --> 02:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
a policy of enforcing timeliness
 
02:37:58.910 --> 02:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
requirements I'm just going to mention
 
02:38:00.830 --> 02:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
that from the testimony it doesn't
 
02:38:04.750 --> 02:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
appear to be that tightly enforced but
 
02:38:08.929 --> 02:38:08.939 align:start position:0%
it needs to be done because
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
timeliness matters
 
02:38:15.770 --> 02:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:18.889 --> 02:38:18.899 align:start position:0%
all right no quit no other comments
 
02:38:21.230 --> 02:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
in that case the motion is ought to pass
 
02:38:23.870 --> 02:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
by representative Rhoda and the clerk
 
02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:26.340 align:start position:0%

okay welcome back I'm opening the
 
02:48:49.309 --> 02:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate bill 106.
 
02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't see uh here
 
02:48:56.330 --> 02:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
please you can talk to us first and then
 
02:48:59.870 --> 02:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:05.590 --> 02:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:08.270 --> 02:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
hello everyone I am Senator Donovan
 
02:49:10.730 --> 02:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
Fenton to represent uh district 10 which
 
02:49:12.170 --> 02:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
is Cheshire county and part of
 
02:49:13.309 --> 02:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County I also want to
 
02:49:14.690 --> 02:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
apologize I sprinted out of my office
 
02:49:16.910 --> 02:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
and left my jacket there so I always
 
02:49:19.429 --> 02:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
usually wear a jacket so that's on me
 
02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to introduce Senate bill
 
02:49:23.929 --> 02:49:23.939 align:start position:0%
106. this bill creates an emerging
 
02:49:25.910 --> 02:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
professional certificate and the
 
02:49:28.190 --> 02:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
requirements for HHS to issue these
 
02:49:30.889 --> 02:49:30.899 align:start position:0%
certificates at a time when we are so
 
02:49:32.150 --> 02:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
short staffed for teachers and
 
02:49:34.190 --> 02:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
caregivers this would help them earn an
 
02:49:36.830 --> 02:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
industry recognized certificate and this
 
02:49:38.090 --> 02:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
would also help bring in high school
 
02:49:40.929 --> 02:49:40.939 align:start position:0%
students into early educator positions
 
02:49:43.309 --> 02:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
this would also make it easier to enter
 
02:49:45.110 --> 02:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
the workforce and potentially earn a
 
02:49:47.030 --> 02:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
higher wage I really want to emphasize
 
02:49:50.929 --> 02:49:50.939 align:start position:0%
that an industry recognized credential
 
02:49:53.210 --> 02:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
upon completing a high school CTE
 
02:49:54.889 --> 02:49:54.899 align:start position:0%
program will not only help them earn a
 
02:49:56.270 --> 02:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
higher wage but it'll help with
 
02:49:56.280 --> 02:49:58.010 align:start position:0%
higher wage but it'll help with
recruitment

02:49:58.010 --> 02:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
recruitment
 
02:50:00.290 --> 02:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
um over 75 percent of CTE Learners
 
02:50:02.690 --> 02:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
enroll in post-secondary education After
 
02:50:04.910 --> 02:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
High School if kids are interested in a
 
02:50:06.410 --> 02:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
career year we should foster that
 
02:50:08.030 --> 02:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
interest and give them the tools they
 
02:50:10.010 --> 02:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
need to succeed and that's all I have
 
02:50:13.969 --> 02:50:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:15.650 --> 02:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for
 
02:50:18.010 --> 02:50:18.020 align:start position:0%
Senator Fenton
 
02:50:20.510 --> 02:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
would you be
 
02:50:26.690 --> 02:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
it says here that they need a high
 
02:50:28.370 --> 02:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
school they need to have graduated from
 
02:50:31.070 --> 02:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
high school right yes well CTE program
 
02:50:33.590 --> 02:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
is in high school right so is would a
 
02:50:38.030 --> 02:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:41.809 --> 02:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
this is this is only available if I read
 
02:50:44.450 --> 02:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
this correctly through the CTE programs
 
02:50:46.190 --> 02:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
in very correct and I believe your GED
 
02:50:47.750 --> 02:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
program's done after hours and things
 
02:50:54.170 --> 02:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:56.090 --> 02:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
02:50:56.100 --> 02:50:57.830 align:start position:0%
thank you so
um to

02:50:57.830 --> 02:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
um to
 
02:51:00.650 --> 02:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
um you know to take these jobs now
 
02:51:02.210 --> 02:51:02.220 align:start position:0%
um what would these people have to do do
 
02:51:03.950 --> 02:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
they have to get an occupational license
 
02:51:06.110 --> 02:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
or what would they have to do currently
 
02:51:08.570 --> 02:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
if this before this bill
 
02:51:10.370 --> 02:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
um to get these jobs currently they have
 
02:51:13.010 --> 02:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
to graduate a similar program or they
 
02:51:15.230 --> 02:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
could do it right out of uh high school
 
02:51:18.290 --> 02:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
without this credential however um this
 
02:51:20.389 --> 02:51:20.399 align:start position:0%
helps recruitment in terms of
 
02:51:23.630 --> 02:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
these children are actively in it so if
 
02:51:26.510 --> 02:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
they're in the CTE program they you want
 
02:51:27.530 --> 02:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
to catch them when they're in the
 
02:51:29.510 --> 02:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
program because it's so because when
 
02:51:30.650 --> 02:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
they leave they might not have an
 
02:51:31.790 --> 02:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
interest in it if they earn this
 
02:51:33.230 --> 02:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
industry recognized certificate
 
02:51:34.969 --> 02:51:34.979 align:start position:0%
recruitment officers will actually go
 
02:51:36.849 --> 02:51:36.859 align:start position:0%
after them
 
02:51:39.650 --> 02:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
so what I'm getting at is um I mean
 
02:51:41.330 --> 02:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
let's say they're in the CT program I'm
 
02:51:43.969 --> 02:51:43.979 align:start position:0%
actually a big CTE fan yeah
 
02:51:46.610 --> 02:51:46.620 align:start position:0%
um if they're in the CT program today
 
02:51:48.530 --> 02:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
they finish this program
 
02:51:50.990 --> 02:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
they get out they want to then go and
 
02:51:52.910 --> 02:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
work what do they have to do around
 
02:51:55.070 --> 02:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
credentialing now to be able to get a
 
02:51:56.809 --> 02:51:56.819 align:start position:0%
job can they just go and get a job
 
02:51:59.030 --> 02:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
without anything else HHS will probably
 
02:52:00.110 --> 02:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
be able to answer that question better
 
02:52:02.530 --> 02:52:02.540 align:start position:0%
than I can let's see thank you
 
02:52:05.030 --> 02:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else but I also want to say
 
02:52:06.590 --> 02:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of certificates for CTE
 
02:52:08.630 --> 02:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
programs for a lot of in need jobs like
 
02:52:10.670 --> 02:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
welding and things like that that aren't
 
02:52:13.130 --> 02:52:13.140 align:start position:0%
a recognized credential
 
02:52:15.110 --> 02:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
well I mean yeah I know there you can
 
02:52:17.630 --> 02:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
come out we have one in Hudson where I'm
 
02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
from at Auburn and uh you know students
 
02:52:22.010 --> 02:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
come out of there and then go directly
 
02:52:23.630 --> 02:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
and get a job as an LNA and have the
 
02:52:25.190 --> 02:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
sort of the license for that as part of
 
02:52:26.269 --> 02:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
the program
 
02:52:28.130 --> 02:52:28.140 align:start position:0%
but I know that if they don't do it that
 
02:52:29.450 --> 02:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
way they have to go out and then apply
 
02:52:30.490 --> 02:52:30.500 align:start position:0%
for a license
 
02:52:32.809 --> 02:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if there's a similar
 
02:52:34.849 --> 02:52:34.859 align:start position:0%
thing here where this avoids them having
 
02:52:37.370 --> 02:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
to apply directly for their first job
 
02:52:39.769 --> 02:52:39.779 align:start position:0%
some kind of occupational license so I
 
02:52:42.889 --> 02:52:42.899 align:start position:0%
think yeah HHS should be able to answer
 
02:52:46.130 --> 02:52:46.140 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
02:52:48.050 --> 02:52:48.060 align:start position:0%
they're questioned
 
02:52:49.969 --> 02:52:49.979 align:start position:0%
all right thank you I think we need to
 
02:53:02.750 --> 02:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:06.710 --> 02:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh Senator Khan has asked
 
02:53:08.929 --> 02:53:08.939 align:start position:0%
to speak first
 
02:53:12.530 --> 02:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
that's we have questions for HHS so
 
02:53:15.170 --> 02:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm Brian Clark general counsel
 
02:53:17.450 --> 02:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:53:19.429 --> 02:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Child Development and Head
 
02:53:22.190 --> 02:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
Start collaboration
 
02:53:22.200 --> 02:53:23.050 align:start position:0%
Start collaboration
um

02:53:23.050 --> 02:53:23.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:26.269 --> 02:53:26.279 align:start position:0%
tell us the requirements if a high
 
02:53:28.429 --> 02:53:28.439 align:start position:0%
school graduate who may or may not have
 
02:53:31.429 --> 02:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
taken this class and does not have a
 
02:53:34.010 --> 02:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
seat this certificate
 
02:53:37.010 --> 02:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
wants a job in child care what other
 
02:53:40.490 --> 02:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
credentials if any do they need okay
 
02:53:42.950 --> 02:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
um so the other available credentials
 
02:53:46.010 --> 02:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
are Early Childhood associate educator
 
02:53:48.349 --> 02:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh early childhood and what are the
 
02:53:50.269 --> 02:53:50.279 align:start position:0%
requirements for that uh so there are
 
02:53:53.030 --> 02:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
additional training requirements above
 
02:53:56.330 --> 02:53:56.340 align:start position:0%
this this is adding a lower rung to the
 
02:53:56.340 --> 02:53:59.269 align:start position:0%
this this is adding a lower rung to the
certification

02:53:59.269 --> 02:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
certification
 
02:53:59.279 --> 02:54:00.769 align:start position:0%
certification
um

02:54:00.769 --> 02:54:00.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:00.779 --> 02:54:03.230 align:start position:0%
um
ladder

02:54:03.230 --> 02:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
ladder
 
02:54:05.809 --> 02:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
yes representative Corona so I'm going
 
02:54:08.389 --> 02:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
to help clarify
 
02:54:10.610 --> 02:54:10.620 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of this
 
02:54:13.130 --> 02:54:13.140 align:start position:0%
is to allow
 
02:54:16.190 --> 02:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
those individuals who have passed this
 
02:54:18.170 --> 02:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
CTE course
 
02:54:22.010 --> 02:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
access to a career in early childhood
 
02:54:25.429 --> 02:54:25.439 align:start position:0%
education without meeting the
 
02:54:28.429 --> 02:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
requirements of additional
 
02:54:31.370 --> 02:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
education or training that's correct so
 
02:54:34.730 --> 02:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a base level entry into
 
02:54:37.190 --> 02:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
this Market
 
02:54:40.550 --> 02:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
um yes it's between being a being no
 
02:54:43.010 --> 02:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
certification and being a
 
02:54:45.650 --> 02:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
Early Childhood educator okay
 
02:54:48.170 --> 02:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
follow up follow
 
02:54:50.510 --> 02:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
if you were if you hadn't taken this
 
02:54:53.690 --> 02:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
class let's say that you've got two
 
02:54:55.610 --> 02:54:55.620 align:start position:0%
running programs you've got the CTE
 
02:54:57.050 --> 02:54:57.060 align:start position:0%
program and you've got a high school
 
02:54:59.870 --> 02:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
program right and the person in the CTA
 
02:55:02.809 --> 02:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
program enters the child care world and
 
02:55:04.730 --> 02:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
let's say this high school student also
 
02:55:08.150 --> 02:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
wants to enter the child care world how
 
02:55:11.450 --> 02:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
does that student enter that world do
 
02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
they need to have participated in the
 
02:55:16.010 --> 02:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
CTE program or is there something that
 
02:55:17.510 --> 02:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
we can do for this high school student
 
02:55:20.510 --> 02:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
who wants to enter the child at the same
 
02:55:20.520 --> 02:55:25.010 align:start position:0%
who wants to enter the child at the same
level

02:55:25.010 --> 02:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:27.110 --> 02:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
um so this is
 
02:55:30.590 --> 02:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
to add an additional report no no what
 
02:55:32.870 --> 02:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
is it that the high school student who
 
02:55:35.990 --> 02:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
didn't take the CTE classes what do they
 
02:55:38.990 --> 02:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
need to do to enter at the same level as
 
02:55:41.690 --> 02:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
the CTE student at any level let's start
 
02:55:44.630 --> 02:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
with okay at any level
 
02:55:47.330 --> 02:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
okay so they would be able to enter the
 
02:55:47.340 --> 02:55:48.650 align:start position:0%
okay so they would be able to enter the
workforce

02:55:48.650 --> 02:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
02:55:50.330 --> 02:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
um however they wouldn't have this
 
02:55:52.490 --> 02:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
additional certificate
 
02:55:54.769 --> 02:55:54.779 align:start position:0%
um and would not be compensated yes
 
02:55:56.510 --> 02:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you okay I have a question
 
02:55:59.090 --> 02:55:59.100 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you what is the value of
 
02:56:01.429 --> 02:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
the certificate then if it doesn't what
 
02:56:04.010 --> 02:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
is the value of the certificate if the
 
02:56:05.809 --> 02:56:05.819 align:start position:0%
high school student can enter the level
 
02:56:08.929 --> 02:56:08.939 align:start position:0%
the same level as a CTE but the CTE
 
02:56:10.790 --> 02:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
person has a certificate in the high
 
02:56:12.349 --> 02:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
school doesn't
 
02:56:14.030 --> 02:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
see where we're going you get two 18
 
02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
year olds who have done the same thing
 
02:56:18.290 --> 02:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
gone to different schools obviously
 
02:56:20.630 --> 02:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
02:56:22.250 --> 02:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
that's where we're going that's where
 
02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
we're going how what's the value of the
 
02:56:29.030 --> 02:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
certificate and what does that give the
 
02:56:32.210 --> 02:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
not only this the the participants or
 
02:56:33.830 --> 02:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
the person who's entering the workforce
 
02:56:36.889 --> 02:56:36.899 align:start position:0%
put the workforce itself okay it shows
 
02:56:39.530 --> 02:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
to the employers prospective employers
 
02:56:41.269 --> 02:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
that they have an interest in early
 
02:56:43.849 --> 02:56:43.859 align:start position:0%
childhood education and that they've
 
02:56:48.730 --> 02:56:48.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:51.710 --> 02:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
and those skills are
 
02:56:55.190 --> 02:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
listed in starting on page 25 on page
 
02:56:55.200 --> 02:56:56.389 align:start position:0%
listed in starting on page 25 on page
one

02:56:56.389 --> 02:56:56.399 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:57:00.530 --> 02:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
with the five five hours sorry
 
02:57:04.670 --> 02:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:07.010 --> 02:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
B one class that includes child
 
02:57:10.370 --> 02:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
development and C A submission of a plan
 
02:57:13.250 --> 02:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
for ongoing professional development
 
02:57:24.309 --> 02:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:28.849 --> 02:57:28.859 align:start position:0%
if one were not to one were to wish to
 
02:57:32.330 --> 02:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
work in early childhood child care
 
02:57:36.010 --> 02:57:36.020 align:start position:0%
but not be a teacher
 
02:57:40.309 --> 02:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:42.110 --> 02:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
um they would have to
 
02:57:42.120 --> 02:57:43.610 align:start position:0%
um they would have to
apply

02:57:43.610 --> 02:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
apply
 
02:57:47.570 --> 02:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:52.550 --> 02:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:52.560 --> 02:57:54.050 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:57:54.050 --> 02:57:54.060 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:57:57.830 --> 02:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
I believe if I'm not mistaken chair that
 
02:58:00.349 --> 02:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
we did I remember a bill
 
02:58:03.769 --> 02:58:03.779 align:start position:0%
that this committee heard several years
 
02:58:03.779 --> 02:58:04.790 align:start position:0%
that this committee heard several years
ago

02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:58:07.969 --> 02:58:07.979 align:start position:0%
that expanded the availability of people
 
02:58:11.090 --> 02:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
working in child care to grandparents
 
02:58:14.090 --> 02:58:14.100 align:start position:0%
and people with life experience does
 
02:58:16.730 --> 02:58:16.740 align:start position:0%
that sound familiar yes yes this is this
 
02:58:21.490 --> 02:58:21.500 align:start position:0%
bill is I understand it is part of the
 
02:58:24.170 --> 02:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
professionalizing of child care and
 
02:58:27.170 --> 02:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
moving it more toward education rather
 
02:58:29.750 --> 02:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
than just oversight and supervision
 
02:58:32.590 --> 02:58:32.600 align:start position:0%
so this is intent attempting to increase
 
02:58:37.070 --> 02:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
the education levels of the child care
 
02:58:44.389 --> 02:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:47.510 --> 02:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
we had a major policy disagreement on
 
02:58:50.090 --> 02:58:50.100 align:start position:0%
that whether we should be pushing for
 
02:58:50.100 --> 02:58:51.130 align:start position:0%
that whether we should be pushing for
the

02:58:51.130 --> 02:58:51.140 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:58:54.830 --> 02:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh educational quality of the child care
 
02:58:58.849 --> 02:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
providers or just the quantity of people
 
02:59:00.889 --> 02:59:00.899 align:start position:0%
who would who could safely oversee
 
02:59:04.250 --> 02:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
children and that has not been fully
 
02:59:06.710 --> 02:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
resolved but this bill it appears to be
 
02:59:09.769 --> 02:59:09.779 align:start position:0%
on the side of increasing the
 
02:59:12.230 --> 02:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
perceived quality rather than quantity
 
02:59:15.830 --> 02:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
would that be a correct assessment
 
02:59:18.170 --> 02:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't disagree with it yeah okay
 
02:59:19.309 --> 02:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:59:22.070 --> 02:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative gold
 
02:59:24.469 --> 02:59:24.479 align:start position:0%
just to try to thank you madam Sharon
 
02:59:26.990 --> 02:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question just to
 
02:59:30.469 --> 02:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
um make sure I understand clearly so the
 
02:59:33.170 --> 02:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
um the certificate the goal is that the
 
02:59:36.050 --> 02:59:36.060 align:start position:0%
certification standard might attract
 
02:59:39.650 --> 02:59:39.660 align:start position:0%
people into the daycare worker field
 
02:59:42.410 --> 02:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
that might otherwise not be interested
 
02:59:45.889 --> 02:59:45.899 align:start position:0%
if there's no more money there's no uh
 
02:59:47.870 --> 02:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
penalty against people who don't have
 
02:59:50.030 --> 02:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
the certification but am I correct in
 
02:59:52.969 --> 02:59:52.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:52.979 --> 02:59:54.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:59:54.230 --> 02:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:56.990 --> 02:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
um so it is intended to incentivize
 
02:59:58.849 --> 02:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
people because they can earn the
 
03:00:01.130 --> 03:00:01.140 align:start position:0%
certificate which will signal to the
 
03:00:02.450 --> 03:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
employer that they've completed
 
03:00:04.849 --> 03:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
additional training uh so they would be
 
03:00:08.690 --> 03:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:11.809 --> 03:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question okay
 
03:00:15.050 --> 03:00:15.060 align:start position:0%
Robson gerhardt thank you madam chair
 
03:00:17.330 --> 03:00:17.340 align:start position:0%
why couldn't this be done by a private
 
03:00:24.950 --> 03:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:24.960 --> 03:00:26.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:00:26.990 --> 03:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:30.710 --> 03:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any the the
 
03:00:33.050 --> 03:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
Bureau of child child development and
 
03:00:35.090 --> 03:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
Head Start collaboration ra issues
 
03:00:35.100 --> 03:00:37.190 align:start position:0%
Head Start collaboration ra issues
certificates

03:00:37.190 --> 03:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
certificates
 
03:00:38.809 --> 03:00:38.819 align:start position:0%
um and credentials people for Early
 
03:00:43.010 --> 03:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
Childhood so it's easier to assign it to
 
03:00:44.690 --> 03:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
us because we've already
 
03:00:47.050 --> 03:00:47.060 align:start position:0%
done this sort of process
 
03:00:49.610 --> 03:00:49.620 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe there is a private
 
03:00:52.130 --> 03:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
organization of child care providers
 
03:00:54.469 --> 03:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
representative leckis thank you I'm just
 
03:00:56.630 --> 03:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
I'm trying so trying to understand
 
03:00:59.510 --> 03:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
um the benefit this gives above I mean
 
03:01:00.889 --> 03:01:00.899 align:start position:0%
you can show
 
03:01:02.809 --> 03:01:02.819 align:start position:0%
your high school transcript that you've
 
03:01:04.490 --> 03:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
gone through a CT program and taking
 
03:01:07.130 --> 03:01:07.140 align:start position:0%
these classes now
 
03:01:10.190 --> 03:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
I don't see a significant difference am
 
03:01:13.790 --> 03:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:15.769 --> 03:01:15.779 align:start position:0%
employer if you're if you're approaching
 
03:01:17.570 --> 03:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
an employer
 
03:01:17.580 --> 03:01:18.849 align:start position:0%
an employer
um

03:01:18.849 --> 03:01:18.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:24.110 --> 03:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
so you're essentially asking if a person
 
03:01:26.510 --> 03:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
has taken these classes but doesn't have
 
03:01:29.650 --> 03:01:29.660 align:start position:0%
a certificate goes to a child care
 
03:01:32.510 --> 03:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
employer and asks for a job
 
03:01:34.790 --> 03:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
what's the difference
 
03:01:37.670 --> 03:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
um essentially it is just shortcutting a
 
03:01:41.450 --> 03:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:41.460 --> 03:01:46.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:01:46.150 --> 03:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:49.070 --> 03:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify if I could so
 
03:01:50.990 --> 03:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it creates a sort
 
03:01:52.670 --> 03:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
of if it's sort of like a fast track
 
03:01:54.950 --> 03:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
right it creates a certificate to the
 
03:01:57.290 --> 03:01:57.300 align:start position:0%
people certificate I'm sorry it's a new
 
03:01:59.090 --> 03:01:59.100 align:start position:0%
type it's a new type of certification
 
03:02:01.550 --> 03:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
that's why it's coming to us because
 
03:02:04.250 --> 03:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
it's a licensing certification so this
 
03:02:06.309 --> 03:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
certification would
 
03:02:11.750 --> 03:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:14.809 --> 03:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
um so they would have to apply and they
 
03:02:16.130 --> 03:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
would meet the requirements and have to
 
03:02:18.290 --> 03:02:18.300 align:start position:0%
apply and then the bureau would certify
 
03:02:18.300 --> 03:02:20.990 align:start position:0%
apply and then the bureau would certify
them

03:02:20.990 --> 03:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:23.210 --> 03:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
question on that why isn't there at
 
03:02:24.769 --> 03:02:24.779 align:start position:0%
least the criminal background check
 
03:02:27.530 --> 03:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
that's required for every other person
 
03:02:29.929 --> 03:02:29.939 align:start position:0%
in the child care field oh there there
 
03:02:31.670 --> 03:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
still would be
 
03:02:33.830 --> 03:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
um you have to complete
 
03:02:36.230 --> 03:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
yes go on you have to complete you you
 
03:02:38.090 --> 03:02:38.100 align:start position:0%
have to complete a background check to
 
03:02:42.849 --> 03:02:42.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:46.969 --> 03:02:46.979 align:start position:0%
but not for the certificate right
 
03:02:49.849 --> 03:02:49.859 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that's
 
03:02:52.130 --> 03:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
perfectly any other questions sir I've
 
03:02:53.690 --> 03:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
done true
 
03:02:55.730 --> 03:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm not familiar
 
03:02:59.630 --> 03:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
with uh the CTE program at all
 
03:03:03.290 --> 03:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:07.010 --> 03:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
300 hours would have to be uh
 
03:03:08.870 --> 03:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
concluded in the high school it's like
 
03:03:12.110 --> 03:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
you're taking this during High School
 
03:03:16.790 --> 03:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
and you've got 300 hours of classroom
 
03:03:18.530 --> 03:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
in high school
 
03:03:21.530 --> 03:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
you have to have 500 but at least 200 as
 
03:03:24.170 --> 03:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
is portraying as for something else so
 
03:03:25.910 --> 03:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
300 hours you have to take in high
 
03:03:25.920 --> 03:03:26.870 align:start position:0%
300 hours you have to take in high
school

03:03:26.870 --> 03:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:03:31.730 --> 03:03:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:35.510 --> 03:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:37.550 --> 03:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
it just seems that like how long would
 
03:03:40.610 --> 03:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:42.830 --> 03:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
03:03:45.769 --> 03:03:45.779 align:start position:0%
an hour and a half a day uh
 
03:03:48.349 --> 03:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
how many days would it take
 
03:03:53.510 --> 03:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
to work up the 300 hours of plasma
 
03:03:55.490 --> 03:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
I don't understand how the program would
 
03:03:57.469 --> 03:03:57.479 align:start position:0%
work but how long would it take a
 
03:04:02.570 --> 03:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:26.150 --> 03:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:28.790 --> 03:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't these questions be directed to
 
03:04:31.670 --> 03:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
former Senator Khan who is the expert on
 
03:04:34.070 --> 03:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
this subject as opposed to this
 
03:04:36.710 --> 03:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
gentleman who was the general counsel he
 
03:04:38.570 --> 03:04:38.580 align:start position:0%
knows the eight representative Schmidt
 
03:04:40.910 --> 03:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
If he if he doesn't know the answer he
 
03:04:43.070 --> 03:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
can he can say so as other people have
 
03:04:43.080 --> 03:04:45.230 align:start position:0%
can he can say so as other people have
said

03:04:45.230 --> 03:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:04:46.790 --> 03:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
if you please if you don't know the
 
03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
answer then just say so two years
 
03:04:52.130 --> 03:04:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:55.130 --> 03:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
follow up and I thank you again thank
 
03:04:56.750 --> 03:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
03:04:59.090 --> 03:04:59.100 align:start position:0%
and the minimum of 200 hours of
 
03:05:01.370 --> 03:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
observation lesson planning that would
 
03:05:08.269 --> 03:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:09.769 --> 03:05:09.779 align:start position:0%
because you'd have to be observing
 
03:05:13.010 --> 03:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
lesson planning practice teaching under
 
03:05:15.349 --> 03:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
the supervision
 
03:05:15.359 --> 03:05:16.550 align:start position:0%
the supervision
yes

03:05:16.550 --> 03:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:05:18.290 --> 03:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:05:20.570 --> 03:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:05:23.150 --> 03:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
Ferguson I'm Smith
 
03:05:25.550 --> 03:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
this is my first experience so bear with
 
03:05:25.560 --> 03:05:26.690 align:start position:0%
this is my first experience so bear with
me

03:05:26.690 --> 03:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:05:29.570 --> 03:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
um I noticed that c the very last part
 
03:05:32.150 --> 03:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
number four on the second page they have
 
03:05:34.010 --> 03:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
to submit a plan for ongoing
 
03:05:36.769 --> 03:05:36.779 align:start position:0%
professional development
 
03:05:39.230 --> 03:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
how often does this license have to be
 
03:05:39.240 --> 03:05:42.230 align:start position:0%
how often does this license have to be
renewed

03:05:42.230 --> 03:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:45.110 --> 03:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
um do you have to submit a plan you're
 
03:05:50.269 --> 03:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:53.510 --> 03:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh there the license doesn't expire but
 
03:05:57.170 --> 03:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
the plan to for ongoing professional
 
03:05:59.690 --> 03:05:59.700 align:start position:0%
development is a requirement of it
 
03:06:02.090 --> 03:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
okay but they'll
 
03:06:05.090 --> 03:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
like teacher does not expire it's not a
 
03:06:07.070 --> 03:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
license it's a credential it says you've
 
03:06:09.469 --> 03:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
met these okay a certificate that says
 
03:06:12.590 --> 03:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
you've met these qualifications okay and
 
03:06:14.809 --> 03:06:14.819 align:start position:0%
therefore it doesn't expire but they do
 
03:06:18.349 --> 03:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
have to do a professional development
 
03:06:20.870 --> 03:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
um portfolio of some sort to keep it
 
03:06:20.880 --> 03:06:21.650 align:start position:0%
um portfolio of some sort to keep it
going

03:06:21.650 --> 03:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
going
 
03:06:24.050 --> 03:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
okay now what if they didn't do that
 
03:06:26.330 --> 03:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
would they lose their credential no well
 
03:06:28.130 --> 03:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't get it in the first place
 
03:06:28.140 --> 03:06:30.710 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't get it in the first place
because

03:06:30.710 --> 03:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:06:32.630 --> 03:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
wait I guess it depends on how you
 
03:06:35.090 --> 03:06:35.100 align:start position:0%
phrase the question
 
03:06:36.469 --> 03:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
I chose
 
03:06:38.809 --> 03:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
discovered after a week or two of work
 
03:06:41.269 --> 03:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
that they really didn't like child care
 
03:06:44.090 --> 03:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
and they decided not to bother their
 
03:06:46.130 --> 03:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
credential would not be revoked that
 
03:06:48.050 --> 03:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
they would not be eligible for a further
 
03:06:49.730 --> 03:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
one okay
 
03:06:51.410 --> 03:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:06:54.650 --> 03:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
Vanessa all right thank you
 
03:07:23.389 --> 03:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:25.790 --> 03:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and it's a
 
03:07:29.030 --> 03:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be back before you and uh
 
03:07:31.550 --> 03:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
other legislative colleagues that I had
 
03:07:33.830 --> 03:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
the pleasure of working with in my last
 
03:07:35.389 --> 03:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
three terms but
 
03:07:38.630 --> 03:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
I didn't seek re-election so I am Jay
 
03:07:38.640 --> 03:07:39.490 align:start position:0%
I didn't seek re-election so I am Jay
Khan

03:07:39.490 --> 03:07:39.500 align:start position:0%
Khan
 
03:07:44.269 --> 03:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
a resident of Keene and uh
 
03:07:47.450 --> 03:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
formerly state senator representing
 
03:07:51.349 --> 03:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:53.570 --> 03:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
I'm passing around some testimony but
 
03:07:56.150 --> 03:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully I'll I'll try to avoid reading
 
03:07:59.170 --> 03:07:59.180 align:start position:0%
the testimony and hopefully you will too
 
03:08:05.030 --> 03:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:08.450 --> 03:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
03:08:11.090 --> 03:08:11.100 align:start position:0%
providing an alternative Pathway to
 
03:08:13.849 --> 03:08:13.859 align:start position:0%
credentialing High School completers of
 
03:08:16.969 --> 03:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
an education career program who wish to
 
03:08:19.010 --> 03:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
enter Early Childhood professional
 
03:08:19.020 --> 03:08:20.269 align:start position:0%
enter Early Childhood professional
careers

03:08:20.269 --> 03:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
careers
 
03:08:23.090 --> 03:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
the emerging professional certificate
 
03:08:23.100 --> 03:08:24.110 align:start position:0%
the emerging professional certificate
credential

03:08:24.110 --> 03:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
credential
 
03:08:26.750 --> 03:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
it credentials high school students at
 
03:08:28.849 --> 03:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
an age when their interest in early
 
03:08:32.690 --> 03:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
childhood education is at its highest if
 
03:08:35.150 --> 03:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
you think about college graduates as
 
03:08:37.910 --> 03:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
they move on and they age
 
03:08:40.250 --> 03:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
their interests go to Elementary and
 
03:08:43.370 --> 03:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
high school students so it it really is
 
03:08:46.070 --> 03:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
a sweet spot for trying to attract
 
03:08:47.870 --> 03:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
people into the Early Childhood
 
03:08:47.880 --> 03:08:49.429 align:start position:0%
people into the Early Childhood
professions

03:08:49.429 --> 03:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
professions
 
03:08:54.590 --> 03:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
and when you think of a Career Technical
 
03:08:57.790 --> 03:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
education and I appreciate
 
03:09:01.269 --> 03:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
representative true's question uh
 
03:09:03.889 --> 03:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
because let's let's establish a common
 
03:09:06.830 --> 03:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
ground here students can complete a
 
03:09:09.969 --> 03:09:09.979 align:start position:0%
program and graduate high school many
 
03:09:13.730 --> 03:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
with a career Ready industry recognized
 
03:09:16.750 --> 03:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
credential which is an IRC
 
03:09:21.309 --> 03:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
in education we have lots of acronyms
 
03:09:23.990 --> 03:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
and in Industry recognized credential
 
03:09:25.550 --> 03:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
means something
 
03:09:28.490 --> 03:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
it means that you have certain
 
03:09:28.500 --> 03:09:30.170 align:start position:0%
it means that you have certain
competencies

03:09:30.170 --> 03:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
competencies
 
03:09:35.750 --> 03:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
that are standardized and that a a body
 
03:09:40.130 --> 03:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
has recognized those qualifications and
 
03:09:43.010 --> 03:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
issued an industry recognized credential
 
03:09:48.710 --> 03:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:51.830 --> 03:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
so that's the purpose behind this bill
 
03:09:54.650 --> 03:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
and when you think of the other Career
 
03:09:57.830 --> 03:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
Technical education programs that exist
 
03:10:00.769 --> 03:10:00.779 align:start position:0%
uh somebody mentioned nursing exactly
 
03:10:03.349 --> 03:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
right complete a nursing program and a
 
03:10:06.950 --> 03:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
CTE you get a LNA a licensed nurse
 
03:10:06.960 --> 03:10:07.870 align:start position:0%
CTE you get a LNA a licensed nurse
assistant

03:10:07.870 --> 03:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
03:10:10.910 --> 03:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
an advanced manufacturing or engineering
 
03:10:13.190 --> 03:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
technology program that you complete in
 
03:10:16.809 --> 03:10:16.819 align:start position:0%
the CTE you get a SolidWorks credential
 
03:10:18.830 --> 03:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
for design
 
03:10:21.650 --> 03:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
uh if it's welding or Machining there
 
03:10:23.710 --> 03:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
are credentials for that
 
03:10:26.870 --> 03:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
if it's traveling tourism and culinary
 
03:10:31.849 --> 03:10:31.859 align:start position:0%
arts there is clear uh entry uh
 
03:10:34.910 --> 03:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
validation is a sous chef
 
03:10:37.969 --> 03:10:37.979 align:start position:0%
um if it's information Technologies it's
 
03:10:42.590 --> 03:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
issued by Microsoft or Cisco who offer
 
03:10:45.070 --> 03:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
industry recognized entry-level
 
03:10:48.650 --> 03:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
credentials for information technology
 
03:10:51.530 --> 03:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
but for a CTE student who's interested
 
03:10:53.389 --> 03:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
in filling a position in Early Child
 
03:10:56.450 --> 03:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
Care there is no industry recognized
 
03:10:59.330 --> 03:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
credential and so this bill aims to fill
 
03:11:02.030 --> 03:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
that void establishing that industry
 
03:11:04.490 --> 03:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
recognized credential will give the high
 
03:11:06.550 --> 03:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
school CTE student
 
03:11:09.469 --> 03:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
completer an opportunity to earn that
 
03:11:11.570 --> 03:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
credential and improve their job
 
03:11:14.349 --> 03:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
earnings so that's how this works
 
03:11:17.630 --> 03:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
for an early child care worker the
 
03:11:20.690 --> 03:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
salary difference between job entry and
 
03:11:22.610 --> 03:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
that first credential is two dollars an
 
03:11:22.620 --> 03:11:24.590 align:start position:0%
that first credential is two dollars an
hour

03:11:24.590 --> 03:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
hour
 
03:11:29.030 --> 03:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
but if your job entry level salary is
 
03:11:31.490 --> 03:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
only fourteen dollars an hour
 
03:11:34.010 --> 03:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
two dollars an hour is a fourteen
 
03:11:35.690 --> 03:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
percent increase
 
03:11:38.210 --> 03:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
so it is a meaningful step
 
03:11:41.510 --> 03:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
for somebody who is a high school
 
03:11:41.520 --> 03:11:42.530 align:start position:0%
for somebody who is a high school
student

03:11:42.530 --> 03:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
student
 
03:11:45.170 --> 03:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
needing to graduate from high school
 
03:11:47.870 --> 03:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
earning a credential and earning
 
03:11:50.030 --> 03:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
fourteen percent more when they enter
 
03:11:53.630 --> 03:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
the field that is the incentive here to
 
03:11:55.969 --> 03:11:55.979 align:start position:0%
attract and retain Early Childhood
 
03:11:55.979 --> 03:11:57.490 align:start position:0%
attract and retain Early Childhood
Workforce

03:11:57.490 --> 03:11:57.500 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
03:12:00.050 --> 03:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:12:02.750 --> 03:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
these high school graduates deserve to
 
03:12:05.210 --> 03:12:05.220 align:start position:0%
earn more than an unskilled job entry
 
03:12:05.220 --> 03:12:06.590 align:start position:0%
earn more than an unskilled job entry
candidate

03:12:06.590 --> 03:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
03:12:09.170 --> 03:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
who will earn fourteen dollars an hour
 
03:12:10.969 --> 03:12:10.979 align:start position:0%
the community college system in New
 
03:12:13.090 --> 03:12:13.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gives
 
03:12:16.250 --> 03:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
CTE program completers college credit
 
03:12:18.110 --> 03:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
and that's called their running Start
 
03:12:18.120 --> 03:12:19.670 align:start position:0%
and that's called their running Start
program

03:12:19.670 --> 03:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:12:22.610 --> 03:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
and for instance in the attached table
 
03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
which comes from the Cheshire Career
 
03:12:24.960 --> 03:12:27.290 align:start position:0%
which comes from the Cheshire Career
Center

03:12:27.290 --> 03:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:27.300 --> 03:12:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:12:28.070 --> 03:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:30.650 --> 03:12:30.660 align:start position:0%
a student completing this program
 
03:12:32.630 --> 03:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
gets six hours of community college
 
03:12:32.640 --> 03:12:33.650 align:start position:0%
gets six hours of community college
credit

03:12:33.650 --> 03:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
credit
 
03:12:35.150 --> 03:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
if you're familiar with the other
 
03:12:37.370 --> 03:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
credentialing for early child care
 
03:12:37.380 --> 03:12:39.410 align:start position:0%
credentialing for early child care
workers

03:12:39.410 --> 03:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
workers
 
03:12:41.870 --> 03:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
it is both credits and hours of
 
03:12:44.150 --> 03:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
experience that allow you to progress
 
03:12:47.269 --> 03:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
towards a Lead Teacher credential that's
 
03:12:51.550 --> 03:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
that's the real gold uh standard here
 
03:12:55.849 --> 03:12:55.859 align:start position:0%
for Early Childhood classroom leaders
 
03:12:57.650 --> 03:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
03:12:59.570 --> 03:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
we're talking about folks that are going
 
03:13:02.570 --> 03:13:02.580 align:start position:0%
to be assisting those classroom leaders
 
03:13:02.580 --> 03:13:04.429 align:start position:0%
to be assisting those classroom leaders
uh

03:13:04.429 --> 03:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:13:04.439 --> 03:13:06.230 align:start position:0%
uh
so

03:13:06.230 --> 03:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:13:06.240 --> 03:13:07.610 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:13:07.610 --> 03:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:11.389 --> 03:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
and I can reference my experience uh as
 
03:13:12.950 --> 03:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
a board member for Southwestern
 
03:13:15.590 --> 03:13:15.600 align:start position:0%

they are charged with administering the
 
03:13:24.110 --> 03:13:24.120 align:start position:0%

state
and

03:13:30.889 --> 03:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:30.899 --> 03:13:32.349 align:start position:0%
and
uh

03:13:32.349 --> 03:13:32.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:13:35.450 --> 03:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
Southwestern Community Services covers
 
03:13:38.510 --> 03:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
both Cheshire and Sullivan counties and
 
03:13:40.130 --> 03:13:40.140 align:start position:0%
they're contracted with the U.S

03:13:52.130 --> 03:13:52.140 align:start position:0%
but because of the Staffing shortage
 
03:13:54.230 --> 03:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
that we're experiencing in early
 
03:13:54.240 --> 03:13:55.610 align:start position:0%

03:13:57.050 --> 03:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:14:00.170 --> 03:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
there are classrooms that are that have
 
03:14:04.910 --> 03:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
been empty this entire Academic Year
 
03:14:08.290 --> 03:14:08.300 align:start position:0%
in Claremont we have students
 
03:14:12.349 --> 03:14:12.359 align:start position:0%
that are there are 17 children on a wait
 
03:14:15.950 --> 03:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
list because that Head Start classroom
 
03:14:18.469 --> 03:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
cannot be staffed
 
03:14:21.710 --> 03:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
in Newport there are there's a classroom
 
03:14:25.010 --> 03:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
and a waiting list of 10 students
 
03:14:28.370 --> 03:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
because that classroom cannot be staffed
 
03:14:31.610 --> 03:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
and the real downside to this if this
 
03:14:34.849 --> 03:14:34.859 align:start position:0%
perpetuates itself is that the U.S
 
03:14:37.130 --> 03:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
Department of Education can take that
 
03:14:39.969 --> 03:14:39.979 align:start position:0%
170 students and because they're only
 
03:14:42.769 --> 03:14:42.779 align:start position:0%
120 being served currently because of
 
03:14:44.210 --> 03:14:44.220 align:start position:0%
Staffing shortages
 
03:14:47.150 --> 03:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
they'll reduce future contracts down to
 
03:14:50.210 --> 03:14:50.220 align:start position:0%
120 students I can't speak for the other
 
03:14:53.990 --> 03:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
four cap agencies
 
03:14:57.889 --> 03:14:57.899 align:start position:0%
but losing a third of the enrollment in
 
03:14:59.889 --> 03:14:59.899 align:start position:0%
each of these programs would be
 
03:15:03.710 --> 03:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
devastating both to the funding formula
 
03:15:06.170 --> 03:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
it makes these successful and to the
 
03:15:08.750 --> 03:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
workforce in the state that's dependent
 
03:15:11.690 --> 03:15:11.700 align:start position:0%
on child care services
 
03:15:14.210 --> 03:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
from the largest Child Care providing
 
03:15:17.030 --> 03:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
program in the nation and in the state
 
03:15:20.929 --> 03:15:20.939 align:start position:0%
so this chronic under enrollment can
 
03:15:22.429 --> 03:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
result in the head start funding
 
03:15:25.910 --> 03:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
decrease it will lock in lower student
 
03:15:29.090 --> 03:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
enrollment in the future and the other
 
03:15:31.910 --> 03:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
downsides are continuing understaffing
 
03:15:35.030 --> 03:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
and younger workers being discouraged
 
03:15:36.769 --> 03:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
from entering the workforce because they
 
03:15:40.309 --> 03:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
can't get child care
 
03:15:43.610 --> 03:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
um so this bill is just a common sense
 
03:15:46.370 --> 03:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
way to break a vicious cycle we can
 
03:15:48.530 --> 03:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
serve both our children and our families
 
03:15:51.170 --> 03:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
better by expanding Early Child Care
 
03:15:53.510 --> 03:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
Workforce through a well-defined high
 
03:15:56.150 --> 03:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
school education and experience pathway
 
03:15:59.750 --> 03:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
and Senate Bill 106 begins a scaffolding
 
03:16:02.630 --> 03:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
pathway for a high school student to
 
03:16:04.929 --> 03:16:04.939 align:start position:0%
enter the Early Child Care professions
 
03:16:08.150 --> 03:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
with that industry recognized credential
 
03:16:10.670 --> 03:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
that begins to lead them to higher
 
03:16:12.889 --> 03:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
credentials through an associate degree
 
03:16:14.690 --> 03:16:14.700 align:start position:0%
program at New Hampshire community
 
03:16:17.210 --> 03:16:17.220 align:start position:0%
colleges or baccalaureate degree program
 
03:16:18.710 --> 03:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire colleges and
 
03:16:18.720 --> 03:16:20.269 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire colleges and
universities

03:16:20.269 --> 03:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
universities
 
03:16:23.269 --> 03:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
this is why I'm present today to ask the
 
03:16:25.910 --> 03:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
Eda committee to please
 
03:16:29.210 --> 03:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
give an ought to pass to this bill so
 
03:16:32.210 --> 03:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
that we can begin to address these vital
 
03:16:34.910 --> 03:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce needs in our state
 
03:16:37.250 --> 03:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:16:38.990 --> 03:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
are there questions
 
03:16:41.870 --> 03:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
Samantha representative Schmidt
 
03:16:43.969 --> 03:16:43.979 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:16:43.979 --> 03:16:45.429 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
so

03:16:45.429 --> 03:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:16:48.889 --> 03:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
Representatives representative growth is
 
03:16:50.870 --> 03:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
earlier question to the previous witness
 
03:16:53.630 --> 03:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
with regard to a previous bill that we
 
03:16:56.090 --> 03:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
had and you were probably in the
 
03:16:58.010 --> 03:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
in the Senate at the time that Bill
 
03:16:59.750 --> 03:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
maybe it had something to do with you as
 
03:17:02.210 --> 03:17:02.220 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact but there were the
 
03:17:04.370 --> 03:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
committee at that time looked at this
 
03:17:07.690 --> 03:17:07.700 align:start position:0%
need which was crying on the part of
 
03:17:11.330 --> 03:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
Health Care Child Care Providers they
 
03:17:16.130 --> 03:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:18.889 --> 03:17:18.899 align:start position:0%
Target in Walmart and so forth who were
 
03:17:22.429 --> 03:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
paying them somewhat more money with no
 
03:17:24.410 --> 03:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
credentials whatsoever
 
03:17:27.950 --> 03:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
start right off the bat and the and the
 
03:17:30.170 --> 03:17:30.180 align:start position:0%
child care workers were having to get
 
03:17:33.530 --> 03:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
continuing education credits to increase
 
03:17:36.849 --> 03:17:36.859 align:start position:0%
their their in their qualification
 
03:17:41.050 --> 03:17:41.060 align:start position:0%
certification so it is the situation now
 
03:17:43.670 --> 03:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
worse than it was then a couple years
 
03:17:43.680 --> 03:17:45.170 align:start position:0%
worse than it was then a couple years
ago

03:17:45.170 --> 03:17:45.180 align:start position:0%
ago
 
03:17:48.230 --> 03:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
I'd say it's unchanged and we know that
 
03:17:50.210 --> 03:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
Target and Walmart are are increasing
 
03:17:52.370 --> 03:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
their their base wage I'm talk I'm
 
03:17:54.830 --> 03:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
talking primarily about how much the
 
03:17:58.910 --> 03:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
need for child care workers is vis-a-vis
 
03:18:00.889 --> 03:18:00.899 align:start position:0%
what it was a couple of years ago I'd
 
03:18:03.349 --> 03:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
say I think it's worse worse in your
 
03:18:05.450 --> 03:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
opinion follow up
 
03:18:08.630 --> 03:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
03:18:11.809 --> 03:18:11.819 align:start position:0%
um what is the experience of child of
 
03:18:15.050 --> 03:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
child care providers with people of this
 
03:18:18.290 --> 03:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
age as employees and in general if you
 
03:18:19.730 --> 03:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
can categorize
 
03:18:23.030 --> 03:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
so and and actually excuse me just let
 
03:18:24.469 --> 03:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
me yeah
 
03:18:25.969 --> 03:18:25.979 align:start position:0%
flesh out my question a little bit
 
03:18:29.090 --> 03:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
because you said they the the people you
 
03:18:31.250 --> 03:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
know people in this age group have the
 
03:18:33.950 --> 03:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
greatest affinity for work in child care
 
03:18:36.650 --> 03:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
that they'll ever have okay as a general
 
03:18:39.650 --> 03:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
categorization so can you put those
 
03:18:42.110 --> 03:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
together in an answer
 
03:18:43.849 --> 03:18:43.859 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question
 
03:18:45.490 --> 03:18:45.500 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh first off let me say Deb Nelson uh
 
03:18:53.389 --> 03:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
who leads this credentialing effort for
 
03:18:55.730 --> 03:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services has been a
 
03:18:58.190 --> 03:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
partner on this legislation and I
 
03:19:00.110 --> 03:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate Mr Clark being available
 
03:19:04.490 --> 03:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
today to answer your questions uh on the
 
03:19:09.170 --> 03:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:13.210 --> 03:19:13.220 align:start position:0%
there is an emerging professional
 
03:19:15.950 --> 03:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
certificate already offered by the
 
03:19:15.960 --> 03:19:16.849 align:start position:0%
certificate already offered by the
department

03:19:16.849 --> 03:19:16.859 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:19:18.469 --> 03:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
and a
 
03:19:20.330 --> 03:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
child care worker
 
03:19:22.610 --> 03:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
who enters
 
03:19:27.230 --> 03:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
any age doesn't matter has to work 750
 
03:19:30.050 --> 03:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
hours in order to earn that emerging
 
03:19:30.060 --> 03:19:31.330 align:start position:0%
hours in order to earn that emerging
professional

03:19:31.330 --> 03:19:31.340 align:start position:0%
professional
 
03:19:31.340 --> 03:19:33.290 align:start position:0%
professional
certificate

03:19:33.290 --> 03:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
03:19:35.210 --> 03:19:35.220 align:start position:0%
that's impossible for a high school
 
03:19:37.429 --> 03:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
student I mean think about it this 500
 
03:19:41.929 --> 03:19:41.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:45.650 --> 03:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
but to not give Equal Credit to students
 
03:19:47.750 --> 03:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
who've had three courses in early
 
03:19:50.030 --> 03:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
childhood to a person who's had no
 
03:19:52.130 --> 03:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
courses in early childhood and nearly
 
03:19:57.490 --> 03:19:57.500 align:start position:0%
750 hours of of classroom assistance
 
03:19:59.870 --> 03:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's just not comparable
 
03:20:03.110 --> 03:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh and and it's unachievable and so
 
03:20:05.030 --> 03:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
these students are walking out and and
 
03:20:07.610 --> 03:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
and get no credit
 
03:20:10.010 --> 03:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
for this for their classroom experience
 
03:20:13.070 --> 03:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's the downside
 
03:20:15.170 --> 03:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
03:20:18.050 --> 03:20:18.060 align:start position:0%
did I hear you say this is an existing
 
03:20:20.450 --> 03:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
credential and all you're doing is
 
03:20:22.309 --> 03:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
changing the requirements for students
 
03:20:24.490 --> 03:20:24.500 align:start position:0%
who complete the CTE
 
03:20:28.210 --> 03:20:28.220 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a dual track it's another
 
03:20:31.429 --> 03:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
track I I understand that but there is
 
03:20:33.410 --> 03:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
an emerging professional credential
 
03:20:35.889 --> 03:20:35.899 align:start position:0%
right now believe that the department
 
03:20:42.230 --> 03:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:44.750 --> 03:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
I believe that's true
 
03:20:47.510 --> 03:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay and so this says that instead of
 
03:20:50.510 --> 03:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
taking X hours of supervised experience
 
03:20:53.510 --> 03:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
and so many cat courses at the community
 
03:20:56.030 --> 03:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
college you can take the CTE
 
03:20:59.750 --> 03:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for that credential
 
03:21:03.050 --> 03:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
um there is no course requirement for
 
03:21:06.050 --> 03:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
the 750 hour
 
03:21:09.110 --> 03:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
emerging professional thank you so it's
 
03:21:10.309 --> 03:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
not available through a community
 
03:21:12.590 --> 03:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
college Senator Schmidt but I I thought
 
03:21:14.990 --> 03:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
that was an important point to no I
 
03:21:16.790 --> 03:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate your intervention Madam chair
 
03:21:18.950 --> 03:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
because this is all part of a complex
 
03:21:20.990 --> 03:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to understand the
 
03:21:24.170 --> 03:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
benefits uh and downsides of there are
 
03:21:26.750 --> 03:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
and so Alternatives and so forth because
 
03:21:30.050 --> 03:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
you want our support for this bill we
 
03:21:31.969 --> 03:21:31.979 align:start position:0%
know from those of us who were here a
 
03:21:33.530 --> 03:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
couple years ago and had that bill
 
03:21:36.469 --> 03:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
before us a crying need
 
03:21:38.330 --> 03:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
in the Healthcare in the child care
 
03:21:41.690 --> 03:21:41.700 align:start position:0%
industry for staff
 
03:21:44.030 --> 03:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
they have ratio requirements do they not
 
03:21:46.730 --> 03:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
if they don't have the people they can't
 
03:21:49.130 --> 03:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
have the kids
 
03:21:52.790 --> 03:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
right so it's out there thank you
 
03:21:52.800 --> 03:21:53.570 align:start position:0%
right so it's out there thank you
um

03:21:53.570 --> 03:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:56.690 --> 03:21:56.700 align:start position:0%
before we go any further Mr Clark could
 
03:21:59.510 --> 03:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
you get your department or someone in
 
03:22:03.170 --> 03:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
them to give us a quick table of the
 
03:22:03.180 --> 03:22:04.250 align:start position:0%
them to give us a quick table of the
various

03:22:04.250 --> 03:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
various
 
03:22:07.490 --> 03:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
Child Care licenses and the requirements
 
03:22:10.490 --> 03:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
for them as they exist right now I was
 
03:22:12.469 --> 03:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
just glancing at the statute and it
 
03:22:14.750 --> 03:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear to be obvious so if you
 
03:22:16.730 --> 03:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
could have somebody interpret it for us
 
03:22:20.450 --> 03:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
to say you could have this these are the
 
03:22:22.670 --> 03:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
levels of licensure and these are the
 
03:22:25.309 --> 03:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
requirements for them we would very much
 
03:22:27.349 --> 03:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate that while we were
 
03:22:29.210 --> 03:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
considering this bill
 
03:22:31.130 --> 03:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
representative would like us and then
 
03:22:32.809 --> 03:22:32.819 align:start position:0%
Gerhart thank you
 
03:22:34.730 --> 03:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:22:37.790 --> 03:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
am I correct in in understanding the 750
 
03:22:39.590 --> 03:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
hour certificate you mentioned that some
 
03:22:42.650 --> 03:22:42.660 align:start position:0%
150 hours basically of work experience
 
03:22:45.410 --> 03:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
in a classroom as opposed to attending a
 
03:22:47.210 --> 03:22:47.220 align:start position:0%
class is that
 
03:22:49.490 --> 03:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct okay thank you
 
03:22:51.650 --> 03:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
the other question I had well but but
 
03:22:53.450 --> 03:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
there is there is a
 
03:22:57.290 --> 03:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
practice teaching component to these I
 
03:22:59.750 --> 03:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
understand High School for the existing
 
03:23:01.130 --> 03:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
one you mentioned
 
03:23:02.450 --> 03:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
um and on this one has there been a
 
03:23:04.190 --> 03:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
discussion with the industry as to
 
03:23:06.710 --> 03:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
whether they'll actually recognize this
 
03:23:06.720 --> 03:23:07.429 align:start position:0%
whether they'll actually recognize this
thing

03:23:07.429 --> 03:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:23:10.790 --> 03:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
if if we put it in place
 
03:23:10.800 --> 03:23:12.830 align:start position:0%
if if we put it in place
yes

03:23:12.830 --> 03:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:23:14.450 --> 03:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
03:23:14.460 --> 03:23:15.889 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
gerhardt

03:23:15.889 --> 03:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
gerhardt
 
03:23:17.510 --> 03:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:23:19.790 --> 03:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
just following up on representative
 
03:23:21.290 --> 03:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
Smith's question about
 
03:23:23.330 --> 03:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
the on the last page see the submission
 
03:23:25.010 --> 03:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
of a plan for ongoing professional
 
03:23:25.020 --> 03:23:26.150 align:start position:0%
of a plan for ongoing professional
development

03:23:26.150 --> 03:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
development
 
03:23:27.950 --> 03:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
so you do that when you first get into
 
03:23:29.870 --> 03:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
the program or you say okay I'm gonna be
 
03:23:31.729 --> 03:23:31.739 align:start position:0%
here in five years nobody checks on that
 
03:23:33.290 --> 03:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
and it's never updated correct so this
 
03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
is just a one and done you just make up
 
03:23:37.849 --> 03:23:37.859 align:start position:0%
a dream list and that's done correct
 
03:23:37.859 --> 03:23:41.090 align:start position:0%
a dream list and that's done correct
uh

03:23:41.090 --> 03:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:41.100 --> 03:23:42.410 align:start position:0%
 
I

03:23:42.410 --> 03:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:23:44.809 --> 03:23:44.819 align:start position:0%
believe that that gets you the
 
03:23:46.969 --> 03:23:46.979 align:start position:0%
certificate it's it is a certificate
 
03:23:52.490 --> 03:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
it's not a it's not a license so it's uh
 
03:23:54.950 --> 03:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you representative
 
03:23:54.960 --> 03:23:56.690 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you representative
Simon

03:23:56.690 --> 03:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
Simon
 
03:23:58.729 --> 03:23:58.739 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um as I've been
 
03:24:00.170 --> 03:24:00.180 align:start position:0%
listening to testimony it seems to me
 
03:24:02.929 --> 03:24:02.939 align:start position:0%
and correct me if I'm wrong the purpose
 
03:24:05.389 --> 03:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
of this is twofold one is to attract
 
03:24:08.510 --> 03:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
students to go into early childhood
 
03:24:11.809 --> 03:24:11.819 align:start position:0%
education education and the second would
 
03:24:11.819 --> 03:24:13.070 align:start position:0%
education education and the second would
be

03:24:13.070 --> 03:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:24:15.290 --> 03:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
um that it creates a financial incentive
 
03:24:17.269 --> 03:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
for them to do so
 
03:24:17.279 --> 03:24:17.870 align:start position:0%
for them to do so
um

03:24:17.870 --> 03:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:20.389 --> 03:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
03:24:22.429 --> 03:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
you said that typically if a student
 
03:24:24.469 --> 03:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
goes on to like their bachelor's degree
 
03:24:26.510 --> 03:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
or whatever they tend to go more towards
 
03:24:28.309 --> 03:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
elementary school education or secondary
 
03:24:31.190 --> 03:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
education as opposed to this
 
03:24:31.200 --> 03:24:32.450 align:start position:0%
education as opposed to this
um

03:24:32.450 --> 03:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:35.510 --> 03:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
what what is the incentive for the
 
03:24:38.210 --> 03:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
student or the employee in this case to
 
03:24:41.330 --> 03:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
go with early childhood education over
 
03:24:44.809 --> 03:24:44.819 align:start position:0%
elementary school or secondary education
 
03:24:46.729 --> 03:24:46.739 align:start position:0%
like why would why would we be trying to
 
03:24:48.889 --> 03:24:48.899 align:start position:0%
incentivize them to do this as opposed
 
03:24:51.290 --> 03:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
to doing the other two
 
03:24:53.690 --> 03:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
as opposed to moving on to moving on to
 
03:24:56.030 --> 03:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
Elementary education and secondary level
 
03:24:59.030 --> 03:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
education well what benefit is the
 
03:25:00.710 --> 03:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
student getting out of making the choice
 
03:25:03.290 --> 03:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
to go directly into this because if they
 
03:25:05.510 --> 03:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't they'll lose interest going into
 
03:25:07.010 --> 03:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
this as opposed to pursuing those other
 
03:25:08.690 --> 03:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
career paths
 
03:25:08.700 --> 03:25:10.729 align:start position:0%
career paths
because

03:25:10.729 --> 03:25:10.739 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:25:10.739 --> 03:25:12.889 align:start position:0%
because
uh

03:25:12.889 --> 03:25:12.899 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:25:15.729 --> 03:25:15.739 align:start position:0%
they qualify
 
03:25:19.849 --> 03:25:19.859 align:start position:0%
and some students I mean work is a
 
03:25:22.190 --> 03:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
necessity for some of our high school
 
03:25:22.200 --> 03:25:23.389 align:start position:0%
necessity for some of our high school
completers

03:25:23.389 --> 03:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
completers
 
03:25:26.150 --> 03:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
and this gives them that entry level
 
03:25:26.160 --> 03:25:27.590 align:start position:0%
and this gives them that entry level
credential

03:25:27.590 --> 03:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
credential
 
03:25:30.830 --> 03:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
and recognizes the education and
 
03:25:32.150 --> 03:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
experience that they've already
 
03:25:33.590 --> 03:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
accomplished through their school
 
03:25:33.600 --> 03:25:34.550 align:start position:0%
accomplished through their school
program

03:25:34.550 --> 03:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:25:37.610 --> 03:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
many schools have school-based child
 
03:25:41.150 --> 03:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
care programs and so whether they have
 
03:25:43.429 --> 03:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
Partnerships outside of the school that
 
03:25:45.050 --> 03:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
the these hours are going to be
 
03:25:48.769 --> 03:25:48.779 align:start position:0%
accomplished or they have uh Day Care
 
03:25:51.769 --> 03:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
within the school Child Care within the
 
03:25:51.779 --> 03:25:52.690 align:start position:0%
within the school Child Care within the
school

03:25:52.690 --> 03:25:52.700 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:25:55.130 --> 03:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
they're going to get both the classroom
 
03:25:58.010 --> 03:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
and the and and and and they qualify for
 
03:25:59.870 --> 03:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
it so this is that kind of scaffolding
 
03:26:02.830 --> 03:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
and we see it in so many education
 
03:26:06.710 --> 03:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
programs that students
 
03:26:10.429 --> 03:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
can enter with this qualification earn a
 
03:26:13.190 --> 03:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
few dollars more per hour continue on
 
03:26:16.190 --> 03:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
because that's what the plan is all
 
03:26:18.830 --> 03:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
about is to give you know that you've
 
03:26:21.950 --> 03:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
thought about how what are my next steps
 
03:26:25.210 --> 03:26:25.220 align:start position:0%
if I want to be successful in this field
 
03:26:28.550 --> 03:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh and there are steps like an assistant
 
03:26:32.090 --> 03:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
teacher and then a Lead Teacher and then
 
03:26:35.630 --> 03:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
then you can operate your own school and
 
03:26:39.349 --> 03:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
become an employer I mean these are the
 
03:26:41.630 --> 03:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
kind of wonderful kinds of things that
 
03:26:44.690 --> 03:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
could happen but many students just just
 
03:26:47.929 --> 03:26:47.939 align:start position:0%
need that entry level wage and then they
 
03:26:49.910 --> 03:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
can continue on through the community
 
03:26:52.729 --> 03:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
college program and Achieve that
 
03:26:54.469 --> 03:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
assistant teacher credential I believe
 
03:26:56.870 --> 03:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
they've got it to complete now then nine
 
03:26:58.729 --> 03:26:58.739 align:start position:0%
hours of which they've got six hours of
 
03:27:00.530 --> 03:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
credit so it's really just one more
 
03:27:02.450 --> 03:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
Community College program after they
 
03:27:07.210 --> 03:27:07.220 align:start position:0%
complete this uh and and then uh
 
03:27:09.590 --> 03:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
the the number of hours that are
 
03:27:12.530 --> 03:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
necessary to qualify for that that's a
 
03:27:15.290 --> 03:27:15.300 align:start position:0%
scaffolding stepping stone
 
03:27:17.450 --> 03:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
a follow-up well
 
03:27:19.429 --> 03:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
my other question is you had mentioned
 
03:27:21.530 --> 03:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
uh a two hour two dollar an hour
 
03:27:24.229 --> 03:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
increase for the first credential that
 
03:27:27.410 --> 03:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
they get on the rung is that
 
03:27:27.420 --> 03:27:28.070 align:start position:0%
they get on the rung is that
um

03:27:28.070 --> 03:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:29.510 --> 03:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
are you getting that from a credential
 
03:27:31.729 --> 03:27:31.739 align:start position:0%
that already exists and if so what
 
03:27:35.110 --> 03:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
credential would that be it is the uh
 
03:27:39.110 --> 03:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
emerging license certificate that
 
03:27:41.630 --> 03:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
and is that are you saying that two
 
03:27:43.550 --> 03:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
dollars is industry wider is that only
 
03:27:47.210 --> 03:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
for state-run programs I I can only
 
03:27:50.929 --> 03:27:50.939 align:start position:0%
speak to the Head Start programs thank
 
03:27:50.939 --> 03:27:52.490 align:start position:0%
speak to the Head Start programs thank
you

03:27:52.490 --> 03:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:27:57.050 --> 03:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:01.010 --> 03:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much senator
 
03:28:02.929 --> 03:28:02.939 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:28:07.670 --> 03:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:12.469 --> 03:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:14.809 --> 03:28:14.819 align:start position:0%
106. sorry
 
03:28:27.290 --> 03:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:29.150 --> 03:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
03:28:31.130 --> 03:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
committee hadn't intended to speak but
 
03:28:34.429 --> 03:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
but I will Peggy Gilmore uh from pretty
 
03:28:36.229 --> 03:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
strategies representing the greater
 
03:28:38.510 --> 03:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
Nashville Chamber of Commerce and I just
 
03:28:40.790 --> 03:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to relay that last evening we had
 
03:28:44.150 --> 03:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
a legislative crossover reception which
 
03:28:45.830 --> 03:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
gathered Business Leaders in our
 
03:28:48.769 --> 03:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
community and legislate legislators from
 
03:28:53.090 --> 03:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
the district and the topics were how do
 
03:28:56.450 --> 03:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
we Foster our Workforce and our economic
 
03:28:59.510 --> 03:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
development in particularly this it was
 
03:29:01.309 --> 03:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
in the greater Nashville area and there
 
03:29:02.690 --> 03:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
were two themes that came out
 
03:29:05.150 --> 03:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
consistently over and over again and
 
03:29:07.070 --> 03:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
that was the need for housing affordable
 
03:29:09.590 --> 03:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
housing and child care it was Child Care
 
03:29:11.210 --> 03:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
Child Care Child Care
 
03:29:14.570 --> 03:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
and the this bill came up specifically
 
03:29:18.710 --> 03:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh not as any kind of Panacea but is one
 
03:29:21.229 --> 03:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
more piece of the puzzle that we could
 
03:29:25.010 --> 03:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
put together to make this uh really a
 
03:29:25.020 --> 03:29:26.030 align:start position:0%
put together to make this uh really a
crisis

03:29:26.030 --> 03:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
03:29:29.150 --> 03:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
to allow people back into the workforce
 
03:29:32.929 --> 03:29:32.939 align:start position:0%
entering the workforce and to give uh
 
03:29:36.530 --> 03:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
Senator Khan said uh the a ladder a
 
03:29:38.929 --> 03:29:38.939 align:start position:0%
scaffolding for our young people to get
 
03:29:42.290 --> 03:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
into this field with interest uh and
 
03:29:46.309 --> 03:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm at their their time of
 
03:29:48.769 --> 03:29:48.779 align:start position:0%
finishing up high school so bringing
 
03:29:50.990 --> 03:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
them in and hopefully being one more
 
03:29:54.469 --> 03:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
piece to help relieve the pressure on
 
03:29:57.050 --> 03:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
this great it's really a crisis for our
 
03:29:59.150 --> 03:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
families and for our businesses that are
 
03:30:00.410 --> 03:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
looking to hire
 
03:30:03.110 --> 03:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
and that's all thank you very much for
 
03:30:04.250 --> 03:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
Testimony because there are
 
03:30:05.990 --> 03:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative gold
 
03:30:07.670 --> 03:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:30:09.410 --> 03:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
taking my question as I'm listening to
 
03:30:11.690 --> 03:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
all the testimony it's striking me and
 
03:30:15.769 --> 03:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you would um agree that
 
03:30:18.670 --> 03:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
um we're sort of talking about for years
 
03:30:22.070 --> 03:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
babysitting was kind of an a note just a
 
03:30:24.469 --> 03:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
nothing thing maybe sort of compared
 
03:30:26.389 --> 03:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
with mothering
 
03:30:29.690 --> 03:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
which is not enough and we all know that
 
03:30:31.969 --> 03:30:31.979 align:start position:0%
but I'm just talking about historically
 
03:30:34.729 --> 03:30:34.739 align:start position:0%
our culture hasn't valued those things
 
03:30:37.370 --> 03:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
as much as being a teacher and an
 
03:30:39.530 --> 03:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
educator and I'm wondering if this in
 
03:30:41.510 --> 03:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
some ways is a way to help our young
 
03:30:44.510 --> 03:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
people see a greater value in caring for
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
young children as much as in educating
 
03:30:50.510 --> 03:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
in a more traditional educational system
 
03:30:52.429 --> 03:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
do you think that might be a part of
 
03:30:54.530 --> 03:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
what makes this so popular
 
03:30:56.330 --> 03:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that question I think
 
03:31:00.410 --> 03:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
anything that that elevates uh
 
03:31:04.790 --> 03:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
the the idea that that investing in our
 
03:31:04.800 --> 03:31:05.750 align:start position:0%
the the idea that that investing in our
youngest

03:31:05.750 --> 03:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
youngest
 
03:31:10.250 --> 03:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh in any way is I mean it is a
 
03:31:12.889 --> 03:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
Continuum if we get our middle youngest
 
03:31:15.950 --> 03:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
our high schools to to Value investing
 
03:31:20.510 --> 03:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
in our littlers it can only be uh
 
03:31:24.229 --> 03:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
an upswing for for all of us
 
03:31:27.830 --> 03:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other questions
 
03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much for your
 
03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
testimony does anyone else wish to
 
03:31:35.510 --> 03:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 106.
 
03:31:37.490 --> 03:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I'm going to close
 
03:31:40.610 --> 03:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
the public hearing and I I will send
 
03:31:43.610 --> 03:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
this to the licensing committee to take
 
03:31:46.610 --> 03:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
a look at what's currently there because
 
03:31:48.290 --> 03:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
this is the first
 
03:31:50.389 --> 03:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
time this session we've had to deal with
 
03:31:56.090 --> 03:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:56.100 --> 03:31:59.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:31:59.870 --> 03:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:02.690 --> 03:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
down so we're done for the day
 
03:32:07.309 --> 03:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
thank you all we I hope anyone who has a
 
03:32:10.490 --> 03:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
committee report please turn it in as
 
03:32:13.070 --> 03:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
soon as possible subcommittee chairs
 
03:32:15.769 --> 03:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
please schedule your work
 
03:32:18.830 --> 03:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
Adam Chan yes I may briefly
 
03:32:21.530 --> 03:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
I I saw a scheduling come out today and
 
03:32:23.630 --> 03:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
we scheduled for the 26th Senate bill
 
03:32:26.510 --> 03:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
105. yeah
 
03:32:29.330 --> 03:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
and looking at that that shouldn't be
 
03:32:30.710 --> 03:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
vacated to Health and Human Services
 
03:32:32.630 --> 03:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
when I look at the subject matter it
 
03:32:35.690 --> 03:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
came out of a no study committee from
 
03:32:38.030 --> 03:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 454 which is a second
 
03:32:39.889 --> 03:32:39.899 align:start position:0%
committee when it came from the Senate
 
03:32:41.870 --> 03:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
went to Health and Human Services for
 
03:32:44.030 --> 03:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
that study committing the approval
 
03:32:47.150 --> 03:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
and I think once again we've already
 
03:32:49.309 --> 03:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
heard two bills in this committee that
 
03:32:51.469 --> 03:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
should have gone to Commerce
 
03:32:54.290 --> 03:32:54.300 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure who's delving out the
 
03:32:55.670 --> 03:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
bills this time around but they're
 
03:32:58.729 --> 03:32:58.739 align:start position:0%
looking at what committee
 
03:33:00.889 --> 03:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
the Senate bills go to instead of
 
03:33:04.250 --> 03:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
looking at the RSA and the content the
 
03:33:06.950 --> 03:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
reason that I've I've talked to a couple
 
03:33:09.050 --> 03:33:09.060 align:start position:0%
of people about this bill that's the
 
03:33:12.650 --> 03:33:12.660 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 105. the reason that it
 
03:33:15.469 --> 03:33:15.479 align:start position:0%
belongs with Edna is that it is about
 
03:33:17.990 --> 03:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
the relationship between HHS and the
 
03:33:19.969 --> 03:33:19.979 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State who has the vital
 
03:33:23.809 --> 03:33:23.819 align:start position:0%
records it's not just within HHS it's
 
03:33:26.030 --> 03:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State as well and
 
03:33:28.070 --> 03:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to deal with
 
03:33:30.530 --> 03:33:30.540 align:start position:0%
and I did notice that there's a whole
 
03:33:32.090 --> 03:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
lot of bills that should have gone to
 
03:33:34.190 --> 03:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
two committees that aren't assigned to
 
03:33:35.870 --> 03:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
two committees and that's one of them
 
03:33:38.269 --> 03:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
they should have gone to HHS and then to
 
03:33:38.279 --> 03:33:39.769 align:start position:0%
they should have gone to HHS and then to
us

03:33:39.769 --> 03:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:33:41.750 --> 03:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay because
 
03:33:43.910 --> 03:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
obviously the study committee that this
 
03:33:46.010 --> 03:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
bill came out of went through Health and
 
03:33:47.450 --> 03:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
Human Services so they have the
 
03:33:49.070 --> 03:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
expertise so I'm hoping someone's going
 
03:33:51.170 --> 03:33:51.180 align:start position:0%
to be here to explain why this came out
 
03:33:52.610 --> 03:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
of that study Community because probably
 
03:33:54.889 --> 03:33:54.899 align:start position:0%
none of us were on it representative
 
03:33:56.330 --> 03:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
Lucas was
 
03:33:58.849 --> 03:33:58.859 align:start position:0%
so hopefully we can and I I should I
 
03:34:01.190 --> 03:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
should mention that in the Senate it
 
03:34:04.190 --> 03:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
sailed through Edna and then it went to
 
03:34:06.170 --> 03:34:06.180 align:start position:0%
finance for some reason and they made a
 
03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
major amendment that totally changed the
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
bill so
 
03:34:15.590 --> 03:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:21.650 --> 03:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:26.050 --> 03:34:26.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:29.269 --> 03:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
committees not for us no you're off the
 
03:34:31.490 --> 03:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
hook every like literally everybody else
 
03:34:32.330 --> 03:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
but not you
 
03:34:32.340 --> 03:34:34.090 align:start position:0%
but not you
[Laughter]

03:34:34.090 --> 03:34:34.100 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:34:44.090 --> 03:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:44.100 --> 03:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
foreign
