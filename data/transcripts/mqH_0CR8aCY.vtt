thank you Mr chairman I'm going to be
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
voting yes on this bill as amended I
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
think you probably may recall my
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
speaking on it when it was before us
 
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.469 align:start position:0%
speaking on it when it was before us
before

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
I can't abandon the work that one
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
division one is done especially for
 
00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
issues like retirement colas
 
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.340 align:start position:0%
food waste uh
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
elderly services for fraud at the
 
00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 align:start position:0%
justice department areas that we added
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
such as taking away
 
00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:06.539 align:start position:0%
oplc we were overwhelmed with the amount
 
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
of activity or necessary work that that
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
would have required we remove that from
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget there are things
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
not only in division one but I looked at
 
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
division three and an issue I know
 
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
important to all of us is the DD
 
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
Community language is put in there so
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
there will never be a DD waiting list if
 
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
money is necessary to continue they can
 
00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:33.419 align:start position:0%
come to the fiscal committee these are
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
all very important things and most
 
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
especially again to highlight the pay
 
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
raise that our state employs over 9 000
 
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
will be getting with our positive
 
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
actions today it's a hundred million
 
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
dollars in each year it covers everybody
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
with a 10 and 2 percent raise for the
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
following year so a 12 percent raise for
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
our state employees I would encourage
 
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
everyone knowing that this is going to
 
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
the second or third base when it gets to
 
00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
the Senate I want to thank my Republican
 
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
colleagues for allowing me to
 
00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:13.259 align:start position:0%
participate in negotiations to try to
 
00:08:16.249 --> 00:08:16.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
I know that the Democratic leader is
 
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
still looking at the proposal that was
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
offered which I thought was a a very
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
good one personally and I'll speak just
 
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
briefly to that so you also know where
 
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
I'm coming from the Republicans were
 
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
willing to give up the entire rainy day
 
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
fund to help satisfy the needs of our
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
caucus the Democrats so fill in some of
 
00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:42.919 align:start position:0%
those holes so again I appreciate you
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
listening to me and I thank the chair
 
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
for his Indulgence
 
00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:49.019 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
further discussion from committee
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
members representative Walnut yes thank
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
00:08:59.090 --> 00:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
so I am going to be voting no and as
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
representative leishman just um
 
00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:03.530 align:start position:0%
representative leishman just um
stated

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
stated
 
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
we have been in negotiations around the
 
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.370 align:start position:0%
we have been in negotiations around the
budget

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:09.380 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
I I hope that we are making some some
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
movement and I know that the Democrats
 
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
are here and willing to continue working
 
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we're there yet
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
there's still a number of areas that we
 
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.190 align:start position:0%
there's still a number of areas that we
have

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:28.790 align:start position:0%
have
um

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
some pretty strong differences
 
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:33.860 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping that in the next few days
 
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
before next Thursday we can come to some
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
sort of um
 
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
some sort of an agreement but for the
 
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
present time I am going to vote no
 
00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:48.899 align:start position:0%
um there's a number of
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
things that I feel like
 
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
we did not complete in this budget even
 
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
though we did have the ability to do it
 
00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:00.380 align:start position:0%
but we were not able to
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
finalize a number of areas so I will be
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
voting no thank you
 
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
well as you can guess I have a question
 
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.490 align:start position:0%
well as you can guess I have a question
um

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:12.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
is what representative leishman said
 
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
those was somewhat surprising to me and
 
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
I'm going to assume that what he meant
 
00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:22.019 align:start position:0%
when he said give up the entire rainy
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
day fund he didn't mean the balance he
 
00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
mean the additions the 44 million thank
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:32.459 align:start position:0%
he meant the part that was going to come
 
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
into it as a result of this present
 
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
representative is that nordgren
 
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to know
 
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
if representative Leachman I think he
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
misspoke I think he talked about the
 
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee being able to allocate
 
00:10:57.769 --> 00:10:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
yes you know my recollection looking at
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
your Division III action it said that
 
00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:05.339 align:start position:0%
additional funds I'll look at the sheet
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
but it said that they could come to the
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
 
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
and representative sitting to my right
 
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
Earth agrees with that
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
yes that's what we did in the fiscal
 
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.389 align:start position:0%
yes that's what we did in the fiscal
committee

00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that the money is that
 
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.370 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that the money is that
we

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:27.899 align:start position:0%
extracted from the FY 23 Surplus well
 
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
Surplus is the wrong word but um not
 
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
Appropriations forward for the DD
 
00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:37.019 align:start position:0%
would be substituted for if need be and
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
then beyond if need be go to the fiscal
 
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.730 align:start position:0%
then beyond if need be go to the fiscal
committee

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:40.740 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
there were several areas that
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
traditionally always come to the fiscal
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
committee the um
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
attorney general and the
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
judicial Council
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
when they need extra money we we never
 
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
know what they'll need so we kind of
 
00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
leave it open and and assume we'll have
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
a few
 
00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
dollars left when we when they come to
 
00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:04.019 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee because it's hard
 
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
to predict what they'll need
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
this is for the record Mr chairman if I
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%

00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:33.899 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
chair there are a couple things I'd like
 
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
to say about hb2
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
um it didn't get much fanfare last
 
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
budget when we did this but we offer uh
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
true and direct
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
property tax relief at the county level
 
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
in hb2 by uh increasing or having a
 
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
relatively high level of
 
00:14:59.750 --> 00:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
State money being invested in
 
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
maintaining a a lower County cap for our
 
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
nursing homes in Rockingham County that
 
00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
calculation was seven percentage points
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the previous or in the
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
current year so so we offer uh exactly
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
what we hear from our taxpayers they
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
need property tax relief we delivered
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
that in hb2 the other thing I'd like to
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
do is to say uh probably for the third
 
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
time in a hearing that I I think that we
 
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
did some really great work that we
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
should be proud of even as we continue
 
00:15:35.449 --> 00:15:35.459 align:start position:0%
to negotiate with one another but there
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
ought to be a recognition I think that
 
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
the governor had
 
00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.230 align:start position:0%
the governor had
um

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:41.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
not proposed a Medicaid reimbursement
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
hike that would be targeted he offered a
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent increase and the and
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
encouraged us to find a way forward and
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh and so without much guidance we got
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
together we encouraged Community
 
00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:02.339 align:start position:0%
involvement the community came forward
 
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
and gave a recommendation that turned
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
into representative Stringham putting
 
00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
together a proposal as the Republicans
 
00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:14.459 align:start position:0%
did one in parallel we accommodated each
 
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
other in terms of what eight the rhb2
 
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
item would look like it's really nice
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
algorithm so that whatever amount of
 
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
money we can invest the the math sort of
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
take care of care of itself and it
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
provides a tremendous amount of relief
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
if we can get it passed so I would ask
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
you to get this passed because if we
 
00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
can't pass hb2 at the end of the day all
 
00:16:42.009 --> 00:16:42.019 align:start position:0%
that great work on increase seeing
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement on a targeted
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
basis goes away and I think that would
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
be very destructive of our Health Care
 
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
system so I'm going to vote Yes on hp2
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
and would encourage my colleagues to do
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
and I would I would remind everyone that
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
the constitution says the New Hampshire
 
00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.870 align:start position:0%
the constitution says the New Hampshire
house

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
does the budget
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
the governor can provide input but it is
 
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
not a budget until it is passed by the
 
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.270 align:start position:0%
not a budget until it is passed by the
legislature

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.370 align:start position:0%
legislature
so

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:16.919 align:start position:0%
we also had 50 bills that our colleagues
 
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
passed through the house
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
that were largely included in hb2 and
 
00:17:24.049 --> 00:17:24.059 align:start position:0%
hb1 so
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
that almost added 300 million dollars so
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
yes we're spending more than the
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
governor but there were legislative
 
00:17:33.169 --> 00:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
Imports that came later so those had to
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
be accommodated and we've had to do
 
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of moving around the pieces
 
00:17:42.049 --> 00:17:42.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
it has been a difficult task and I
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%

Stringham
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
um you know I'd like to
 
00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
um uh second that my colleague's
 
00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:42.980 align:start position:0%
comments on about the really good work
 
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
supporting the counties uh uh uh groups
 
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
like the community health centers many
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the other waiver programs there was a
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
lot of substantial progress made uh in a
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
in a very short period of time and great
 
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
cooperation I think on both sides I am
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
still going to vote against this hb2 at
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
this point mainly because there's some
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
unresolved issues that I think we can
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
make make progress on and that are very
 
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
very important for the state and for the
 
00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
long-term future this of the state
 
00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:21.299 align:start position:0%
including education funding formulas
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
some tax related issues and boosting the
 
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates enough uh to actually
 
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
keep keep them from collapsing but that
 
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't diminish what we've done to
 
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
reduce the emergency room and parking
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
problem and I think we can be very proud
 
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:48.299 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm looking forward to voting
 
00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:51.539 align:start position:0%
yes on hb2 as amended I was proud to
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
vote for hb1 it is a bipartisan budget
 
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
that we have built over the last few
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
weeks and months in the state of New
 
00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:00.419 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are increasing spending
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
nearly a billion dollars without
 
00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
increasing a single tax or fee as a
 
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
testament to the strength of our Granite
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
State economy and I'm proud of that
 
00:21:12.169 --> 00:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
recognition of fact that we don't have
 
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
to increase taxes or fees to make sure
 
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
we are meeting the needs of the people
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
of our state there's always going to be
 
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
parts of a budget we don't like that is
 
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
just the basic bare minimum fact of
 
00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
reality that there will be parts of a
 
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:27.059 align:start position:0%
budget you may not appreciate you may
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
not like what we've been hearing is it
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't spend enough we are spending
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
over roughly billion dollars more than
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
the last biennium without increasing
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
taxes without increasing fees we should
 
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
be proud of that it is a strong
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
bipartisan budget today that delivers
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
for the people of New Hampshire to
 
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
delivers for police officers and
 
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
firefighters who were joined the service
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
before 2011 in restoring that retirement
 
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
promise to them it delivers for the the
 
00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
providers in Medicaid reimbursement
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
rates and we're not in disagreement that
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
we want to increase those further but we
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
we have to find the money to do so with
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
our constraints it is a good budget it
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
is a bipartisan budget there's a lot of
 
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
pieces in the budget I'm not a fan of
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
I'm voting for it because it is good
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
policy for the State of New Hampshire
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
for the next two years I know we could
 
00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
all go around the room point out the
 
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
pieces that we hate in this budget but
 
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
there is a lot for everyone to love and
 
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm voting for it I urge my
 
00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
colleagues to recognize that fact that a
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
lot of the positions the house has taken
 
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
that may differ with other people in
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
this building or across the street those
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
will be gone if we do not pass a budget
 
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
that is what we're playing with here if
 
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
we say oh it's it's not what I want
 
00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
exactly then we are throwing out we are
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
letting perfect be the enemy of the good
 
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
and that is bad public policy it's bad
 
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
way to budget and I would just urge
 
00:22:57.049 --> 00:22:57.059 align:start position:0%
everyone to vote yes thank you
 
00:22:59.690 --> 00:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
further comments from committee members
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner thank you
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
so I am going to vote no but like I said
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
before I think
 
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
um we have been spending some time in
 
00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
the last couple of days trying to come
 
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.510 align:start position:0%
the last couple of days trying to come
to

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
some agreement on some of the issues
 
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.690 align:start position:0%
some agreement on some of the issues
that

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
have divided us and
 
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
um there are many things in this budget
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
that we should be very proud of and the
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
governor sent us a budget that gave a 10
 
00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
and a two percent rate increase wage
 
00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
increase to our state employees
 
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
we're all know how desperately that is
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
needed and how much in support we are of
 
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.610 align:start position:0%
needed and how much in support we are of
that

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
um it also went a long way in fixing a
 
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
problem for some of our retirees that
 
00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059 align:start position:0%
happened a number of years ago
 
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
so there are there are lots of good
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
things here we've taken a big step
 
00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
towards trying to address the Medicaid
 
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:02.700 align:start position:0%
Rate rates paid to our Vital providers
 
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
it has not gone far enough I think we
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
need to continue to look at that that's
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
one piece of what is not really going to
 
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of the providers and
 
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
these are providers that we our state
 
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
needs desperately without them expenses
 
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
will be much much higher
 
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559 align:start position:0%
um in the budget I think there is
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
something that feels to me like it is
 
00:24:29.039 --> 00:24:30.350 align:start position:0%
something that feels to me like it is
really

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:24:33.529 --> 00:24:33.539 align:start position:0%
does not need to be here at all and that
 
00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:35.029 align:start position:0%
does not need to be here at all and that
is

00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
um Medicaid expansion the Senate has
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
sent us is sending us a bill they have
 
00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:42.059 align:start position:0%
passed it they're sending us a bill
 
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
actually someone told me that the public
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
hearing is next Wednesday on that bill
 
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
um that is the time for the house to
 
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
weigh in
 
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
not in the budget
 
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
so that piece being in the budget I
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
think is is a problem for many of us
 
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.430 align:start position:0%
think is is a problem for many of us
um

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
hopefully within the next week we can
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
work out some of these differences and
 
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
on next Thursday hopefully we'll see a
 
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:16.919 align:start position:0%
different a different outcome but today
 
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
I am going to vote no on this on House
