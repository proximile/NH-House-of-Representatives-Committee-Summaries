opportunity to welcome everybody to this
 
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
new committee which is called education
 
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:15.800 align:start position:0%

Technical education and higher education
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh legislation as well um we broke this
 
00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:24.519 align:start position:0%
up simply because we had so many bills
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
last year and you all know how many we
 
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
were rifling through and we had a total
 
00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:31.079 align:start position:0%
of 23 5 some odd bills over the course
 
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
of that bium it was very difficult so
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
now we broken up and I think this will
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
allow us the opportunity to really
 
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
explore and research and and really
 
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
those topics that need more done to them
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
and we know what those topics are so
 
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%

quite a trip and we'll enjoy it uh we

have six new members here on our

committee and 12 that are returning that
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
have been either on this committee or
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
other committees in previous years so a
 
00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:49.959 align:start position:0%
lot of talent what we're going to do
 
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
next is I'm going to go through some of
 
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
the process processes and procedures
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
that I I use when I'm running this
 
00:13:58.269 --> 00:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
particular committee and I believe
 
00:14:00.749 --> 00:14:00.759 align:start position:0%
everybody should have a copy of the
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
two-sided sheet that unfortunately I I I
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
started putting this together last night
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
when I'm watching
 
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
the Rams and the Vikings play football
 
00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
or at least some of them were playing
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
football and um so it's kind of
 
00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:18.759 align:start position:0%
disjointed but I think all my points are
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
here on it so I'd like to just go that
 
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
does everybody have a copy of that right
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
here in front of us right now it's just
 
00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:27.959 align:start position:0%
a singular sheet no two holes in it uh
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
okay the the first bullet simply is what
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
our responsibilities are and when we we
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
developed this committee we developed
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
with the intent of doing just what I
 
00:14:43.629 --> 00:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
said earlier of looking at those
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
policies which are associated with
 
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
funding so when we move things on to
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
represent Earth's Committee in division
 
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
two that we actually done some a little
 
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
bit more homework and and looking at
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
those fiscal measures asso assciated
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
with that policy there's implications
 
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
going both ways and we're looking at
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
those big issues which we went through
 
00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh over with doe and we were
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
we were there and we looked at the
 
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
foundation formula we looked at the
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
building Aid stuff we looked at Career
 
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
Technical education special education uh
 
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
special education Aid catastrophic as we
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
some call we've been warned don't call
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
it cat Aid anymore I that's in my brain
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
and I always call it cat Aid and so
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
there's a number of issues and we and
 
00:15:32.829 --> 00:15:32.839 align:start position:0%
also issues associated with higher
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
education which I think we'll hear a
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
little bit about today so that's where
 
00:15:40.269 --> 00:15:40.279 align:start position:0%
our direction is now going down uh the
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
bullets here so quickly because we do
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
have limited time if anybody has a
 
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
question as I'm going through these
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
please just put your hand up I don't
 
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
have my gavel with me they're all at
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
home and I had a little six-year-old
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
today playing with it one of them and
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
and it was taken from the lowboy where I
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
was supposed to take it to work and I
 
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
didn't I think he has it probably
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
somewhere in his
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
backpack so at any rate um going down
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
through this B buttons right here our
 
00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
bullets we we have a security plan here
 
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
in this building and through the Capitol
 
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
Building all through the L and on this
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
campus as you all know if in fact there
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
is a security issue I've highlighted
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
that phone number which you may want to
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
put in the speed dial on your phones
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
um normally and what we always do is
 
00:16:36.309 --> 00:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
there there's always a person by The
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
Doors right here which is given the
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
assignment if we are having an issue uh
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
from the public or some other type of
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
issue which we need some kind of
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
response then the wink and a nod goes to
 
00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
that person the person goes out and does
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
that but also we also will try you push
 
00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
the the the uh cell phone and and a Comm
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
unication will be made and we can get
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
response here very very
 
00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:05.079 align:start position:0%
quickly not be laboring that we'll get
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
into it a little bit more um the
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
chairman of the committee that's myself
 
00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
the vice chair and the ranking member
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
that's represented luno beside
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
represented spillsbury here and then we
 
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
also have our clerk sitting beside me
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
representative Brown is new to the game
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
she's going to get some training
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
tomorrow she's been involved though in
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
government and and in
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
education and I look forward to working
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
with uh representative Brown here um she
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
will have that training as I said again
 
00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:41.799 align:start position:0%
tomorrow but recognizing I was a clerk
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
once and I was removed from my job by
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
the speaker at that time for a reason I
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to go into um so at any rate
 
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
um the we got to be respectful of our
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
clerks you know they they're they're
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
when we want to start acting and doing
 
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
some we have to always check are you
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
ready Pam and so so that's uh so very
 
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
very important job probably at when
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
we're business here her her job is one
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
of the most important because it's part
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
of the statutory record or the intent
 
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
and all the records associated with the
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
notes which are taken now you tell me
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
yeah you're welcome
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
um we always start our meetings off with
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
announcements and what's going to happen
 
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
with the date in front of us um are we
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
going to learn also if there is a person
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
who knows at that time that I'm going to
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
be out I have another meeting going to
 
00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
have to testify it later on so we can
 
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
build our schedule during the day around
 
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
that movement I know that's going to
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
happen with people here that are in dual
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
committees we're going to have movement
 
00:18:52.149 --> 00:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
back and forth so if you're going to be
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
out a given day I I'd like to know that
 
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
or if you're for example going to be
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
doing an activity at at another
 
00:18:59.710 --> 00:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
committee where you're exec at the same
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
time let us know that
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
um going down these bullets here just
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
some the
 
00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
protocols we've had I've been in this
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
house here a number of times when we've
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
actually had the governor come in or the
 
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
governor's wife come in that happened
 
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
with Governor Lynch when he was here the
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
his wife came in and she wanted to
 
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
testify along with himself when a
 
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
governor comes in we stand up and and
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
and a matter of respect to the the
 
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:35.480 align:start position:0%
position the chief justice as well and
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
we be I have to be cognizant of that um
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's a matter of courtesy and it's
 
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
just professional
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
ethics uh sponsor co-sponsor introduces
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
a bill if a no-show chairman May appoint
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
a Committee Member these are not in
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
order I'm jumping here but I'm just
 
00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:53.799 align:start position:0%
going in the order of the sheet we've
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
had sometimes when we posted a
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
hearing and either the sponsor or any
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors none are here but we have
 
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
members of the public who travel down
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
from cook or up from Rochester and they
 
00:20:12.909 --> 00:20:12.919 align:start position:0%
want to testify so what we'll do is I
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
will appoint a person on the committee
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
to introduce the bill the person on the
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
committee doesn't have to take ownership
 
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
in the bill at all and try to defend the
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
bill just introduce the bill and that
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
will be part of the record the pink card
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
is filled out by that in individual that
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
do it and and we go on but we respect
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
the people have come down or up or
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
across or from to you know take their
 
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
testimony we may in fact if we recognize
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
we need more we can also take that
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
testimony and then recess and come back
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
and take that bill up later uh or or
 
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
gather information in other
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
ways um Senate uh testimony heard first
 
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
um we I think you've had this in your
 
00:20:59.789 --> 00:20:59.799 align:start position:0%
training for the new but folks but when
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
Senators come in we try to get them in
 
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
and out of here they are often times on
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
two or three different committees and
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
they're running so let's just recognize
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
that they are uh busy people so I will
 
00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
also sometimes jump them in the order
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
and may have a stack of pink cards we've
 
00:21:19.149 --> 00:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
had some bills in here where we can be
 
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
discussing a bill in a hearing all day
 
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
long and and so we will just jump the
 
00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
Senators up and bring them in and take
 
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
care of them
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh bills with financial notes are early
 
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
bills the early bills I think the date
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
is what March 6th that we have to report
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
them out by and unfortunately sometimes
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
we get notice that you have an early
 
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
Bill all the bills haven't been issued
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
to committees at this time and so we
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
just don't know and and and then we're
 
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
also waiting the for the fiscal notes
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
and that's another reason why we have
 
00:21:59.549 --> 00:21:59.559 align:start position:0%
broken apart uh the the Committees here
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
so that we will I I think when they're
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
seeing a request from the education
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
funding uh committee for the LBA will
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
help uh initiate and expedite that
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal reporting process to us so we'll
 
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
have that information available to us
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
from the agencies and the Departments or
 
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.510 align:start position:0%
from the agencies and the Departments or
the

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
bureaus uh hearings do not require a
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
quorum years and years ago I remember
 
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
sitting in here at a hearing only two
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
members present and it was on a noow dat
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't called and that was way
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
back I think we're talking now back to
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
2008 2009 in that era um so we can
 
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
conduct a hearing but in the executing
 
00:22:43.269 --> 00:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
bills we must have a quorum we must have
 
00:22:45.549 --> 00:22:45.559 align:start position:0%
a quorum and while we're talking about
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
that I'll jump and just take this other
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
item up if anybody's going to be absent
 
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
and needs a replacement we have to know
 
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
of that absence the prior Day by the
 
00:22:59.470 --> 00:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
Clos the shop on that day so if we have
 
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
for example a an exact session coming up
 
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
on the Wednesday by Tuesday afternoon to
 
00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:06.919 align:start position:0%
close the shop we need to know who's
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
going to be here and who's not going to
 
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
be here and you let your ranking member
 
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
know if you're on the Democratic Party
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
in the vi or the vice chair of the
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
majority party here or myself know that
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
they will contact those offices and a
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
replacement will be
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
found but that's very very important
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
it's also if you're not and when
 
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
you're calling in saying I'm not going
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
to be there you're not going to be there
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh if you show up on the next day that
 
00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799 align:start position:0%
is not going to work so you know if
 
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
you're you're being replaced you don't
 
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
show up the day you're being replaced on
 
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
the campus
 
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
anywhere okay going on down uh Sim bills
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
require larger rooms we may have that
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
occur here on Thursday this week when
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with uh hb15 that's
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
Universal EFA Bill uh in the past we've
 
00:24:04.269 --> 00:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
gone to rep's Hall uh We've also gone
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
and and lately we've developed the other
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
process where there are other rooms
 
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
available where the Overflow can go
 
00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
there and the bill is being streamed
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
over there as well and so then I will
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
announce over there we have so such and
 
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
such person will be coming up next and
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
so and so is on Deck just like you're
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
watching a baseball game and so the ones
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
across the way will be able to get
 
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
themselves together and be ready to come
 
00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
in and
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
testify those occasions also bring in
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
the the concept that we may have to
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
reduced amount of time we're allowing
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
the public to
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
speak my policy on this committee is
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
that the prime sponsor of a bill is
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
entitled to have more time than a person
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
that's going to come and be a co-sponsor
 
00:24:53.389 --> 00:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
or some other member of the public who
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
wants to speak that's just been policy
 
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
of Education I believe some other
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
committees do the same thing if the
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor has a very detailed Bill
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
and we've had some bills come in that
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
have 27 Pages or so that takes a lot of
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
discussion and in and and presentation
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
to this committee we will allow that
 
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
time to that be done but subsequent
 
00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
people coming for and testifying may be
 
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
given time limits depending upon the
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
load of people we
 
00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
have also a policy I have is that we
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
have a number of parents that travel in
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
and some of them have really young
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
children ages one and younger and we
 
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
just don't want to hold them up here as
 
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
long that long so if I see a mother or
 
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:39.799 align:start position:0%
father out there with young kids running
 
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
around helping them expedite it and get
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
it done I will move them up in the in
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
the amount in the list of those to
 
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.200 align:start position:0%
testify and also we'll try and look at
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
those people are traveling those greater
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
distances and and help them out too as
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
well um especially in the winter here
 
00:25:59.789 --> 00:25:59.799 align:start position:0%
when it gets dark and it's it's not fun
 
00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
driving home and I know that because I
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
have to drive an hour and a half to get
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
here every day and so the the the dark
 
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
hours are not not
 
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
fun uh I talked about testifying times
 
00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
we may limit those times to two or three
 
00:26:15.149 --> 00:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
minutes a person depending upon the
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
crowd that we have and we do that I
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
usually have the vice chair represent
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
spillsbury with their cell phone right
 
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
here clocking it and then we have to you
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
know tell okay time's up and you yeah
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll stretch that sometimes for
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
another 15 seconds or so but that's
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
about the limit cuz we have to be
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
everybody um going down here I talked
 
00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
about the children the breaking breaks
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
during meetings you can see I have a a
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
bottle of water here um I used to have
 
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
an old hood coffee small coffee thing
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
and people always thought I'm up here
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
drinking coffee milk that there was
 
00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
water in it but then of course it was
 
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
Plastics and all that stuff that's not
 
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
good for you and all that so now we went
 
00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
to this aluminum I don't know it's an
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
aluminum but at any rate uh we I do
 
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
encourage you to have fluids uh there to
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
drink um uh while we're going through
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
this process this is a very very dry
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
building and I I start recognizing
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
Myself by 11:00 unless I'm starting to
 
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
drink something it gets difficult and
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's not healthy so please you know
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
bring some liquids with you some say
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
it's water I don't object to something
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's made out of water that's in your
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
bottle just make don't go all the way we
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
know where I'm going uh but uh it's very
 
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
very very important and also any member
 
00:27:53.389 --> 00:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
that has pardon me no Irish whiskey
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
that's exactly exactly right and if
 
00:27:58.509 --> 00:27:58.519 align:start position:0%
somebody has to get up and and and and
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
go to a washroom down the hallway do it
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
if you have to get up for some reason go
 
00:28:07.509 --> 00:28:07.519 align:start position:0%
to another committee do it but let's try
 
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
to do it at a time when maybe if there's
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
somebody testifying at that particular
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
moment wait till that person stops
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
testifying and then do the movement and
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
never when you're coming back in cut in
 
00:28:21.509 --> 00:28:21.519 align:start position:0%
front of a person that's testifying
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's just like in the speaker we used
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
to have a rule here too that on cell
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
phone use during your your your
 
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:31.240 align:start position:0%
uh while you're in committee here and
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
this was years ago I think this was back
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
when Mary guile was um chair and
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
anybody's cell phone that went off
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
bought everybody else lunch that day and
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
so you know put it on mute and mine's on
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
mute right now uh but uh it it's it it
 
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
is distracting when those things are
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
going off and while we're talking about
 
00:28:59.230 --> 00:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
this technology how I have my computer
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
right here um and I I know that
 
00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
especially in terms of the the clerk
 
00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
some clerks like to take their notes uh
 
00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
on the computer that's very very
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
acceptable if you're using your computer
 
00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
during an exact session to look up
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
statutes and all that that's wonderful
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
do it but let's be careful how much
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
we're using this computer during a
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
public hearing where we're taking
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
testimony from people people it's it's
 
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
I've testified before in some committees
 
00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
where that's occurring and sometimes you
 
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
wonder are they listening to me are they
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
hearing what I'm presenting and so so
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
let's I I understand there may be some
 
00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:46.519 align:start position:0%
situations for example if you're in a
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
hearing and you don't have yourself but
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
maybe you have a notice that comes over
 
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
your computer that a made arrangements
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
with the person down in finance and
 
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to let me know 5 minutes
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
before I'm supposed to be down there a
 
00:29:59.789 --> 00:29:59.799 align:start position:0%
testify and it comes in on might be
 
00:30:03.789 --> 00:30:03.799 align:start position:0%
that's fine but um let's try to not use
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
those those computers during the hearing
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
process um it's it's it's uh I think it
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
really sends a message to somebody
 
00:30:15.149 --> 00:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
that's coming from the other side of the
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
table from
 
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
us um breaks meetings rooms are dry
 
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
drink water oh also here's something
 
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
that I had a rep tell me the other day
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
thank goodness you told us this uh
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative lad uh early on they coat
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
racks up and down the hallway here and
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
some folks hang their coats on the coat
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
racks CU years ago when I'm sitting on
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
this committee i m been my first year or
 
00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.149 align:start position:0%
this committee i m been my first year or
second

00:30:43.149 --> 00:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:30:45.389 --> 00:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
year 2008
 
00:30:49.389 --> 00:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
2009 that a fella had his jacket out
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
there and there's other kinds of
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
hearings going on when he came out his
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
jacket was gone somebody had mistaken
 
00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
his jacket or taken it
 
00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:01.799 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately in the pockets of his
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
coat were the keys to the car and his
 
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
wife had to drive over from the main
 
00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
border with New Hampshire with the other
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
set of the keys for that car later on
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
that evening to get him home and so be
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
careful if you hang your jacket in the
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
hallway we do have a coat rack in here
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to use it but if if you
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
if you're hanging up in the hallway
 
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:26.120 align:start position:0%
check to make sure everything that's of
 
00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
value is out of their pocket so that
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
jacket CU it could disappear on
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
you all righty
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
uh when you're in a hearing the last uh
 
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
bullet on that page there um when we're
 
00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:46.919 align:start position:0%
re in committee members and people are
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
testifying please do not engage in
 
00:31:51.389 --> 00:31:51.399 align:start position:0%
running debates with the person that's
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
testifying you know that's really
 
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
important we're here to hear and you
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
hear things that some sometimes you're
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
not comfortable with or sometimes you
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
think well that's not where I am but
 
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
that's not the purpose of the hearing
 
00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the hearing and that's
 
00:32:08.629 --> 00:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
the beautiful thing about this state
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
where we have 400 reps and we're
 
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
representing so many people throughout
 
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
this state and the ratio is smaller than
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
any other state in the country as far as
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
public to representative we have the
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
same opportunity for people coming in to
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
these committees from our public and so
 
00:32:25.629 --> 00:32:25.639 align:start position:0%
we do have a lot of testimony in
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
hearings especially on those hot times
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
topics Charter Schools
 
00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.269 align:start position:0%
topics Charter Schools
efas

00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
efas
 
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
funding they're all hot but uh and and
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
we'll have a lot of people test just
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
don't get into a running debate with
 
00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:41.720 align:start position:0%
them and start expressing your personal
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
opinion and that favorite question some
 
00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039 align:start position:0%
people like to ask is would you believe
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
and they go on and express their opinion
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
we don't need to hear that um uh the the
 
00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:56.519 align:start position:0%
question shouldn't be going to them we
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
should be ask you know
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
the the question does go to them but
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
they don't want to hear what your
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
opinion is because then it's saying to
 
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
them well what what their opinion
 
00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.389 align:start position:0%
them well what what their opinion
doesn't

00:33:07.389 --> 00:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
count um I spoke about use of
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
Technology uh technical questions or
 
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
information request of a public member
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
must be asked of the public at the
 
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
discretion of the chair so if in fact
 
00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
there is a person on the committee that
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
for example we've had the it happen in
 
00:33:28.269 --> 00:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
executive sessions where we just don't
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
have all the information yet and there's
 
00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
some question so we have people out
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
there with orange bad badges I see Brian
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
I see Jerry out there and others
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
um they may have an answer and represent
 
00:33:45.389 --> 00:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
Luna you've asked several times could we
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
have somebody from the could we get some
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
more information on this one and the
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
question has to come to the chair and
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
the chair uses the discretion yes or no
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
I'm going to allow that or I'm not going
 
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
to allow that to occur
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
so so please if if we need more
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
information for some reason or if you
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
need more information direct that
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
question to me and if there's somebody
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
out there that can help and if it's a a
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
a a question that I feel appropriate to
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
be asked at that moment then we will ask
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
those people and they don't have to
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
respond out there they can say nope I'm
 
00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
not going there and
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
so that's that's that that one right
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
there um remove moving stickers or
 
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
buttons or those expressions of where
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
you are on a particular issue uh I frown
 
00:34:37.629 --> 00:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
on that I really frown on that in this
 
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
committee my job here is to represent
 
00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
everybody on this committee regardless
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
what party you're on I'm representing
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
the whole committee as a whole here and
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
ensuring that it's fair and there's no
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
discrimination going on on this
 
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
committee some people don't understand
 
00:34:58.109 --> 00:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
that because some people think well here
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
I am a republican I'm supposed to be
 
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
supporting the Republican perspective no
 
00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
I'm respecting the meaning of a hearing
 
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
and so everybody has a fair opportunity
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
to import impart their position to us
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
and do it in a respectful
 
00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:17.720 align:start position:0%
manner so uh that's really important
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
when we're coming to these buttons and
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
these Expressions I support this or that
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't want anybody testifying with
 
00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
that we don't allow placards in this
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
room and uh and it's not like the US
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
Congress where they can have all kinds
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
of charts and things behind them we
 
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
don't have that we will have an occasion
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
where we've had bills which are are
 
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
are dealing with a specific issue maybe
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
it's a health issue or a a bill to uh
 
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
get more uh defibulators in schools and
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
we want to name that bill in memory of a
 
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
person or something such as that and you
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
may have a parent come in with a
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
photograph of their child that happens
 
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
and it's it's a sensitive issue it's one
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
where I use common sense on that and and
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
and generally speaking we'll allow that
 
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.430 align:start position:0%
and generally speaking we'll allow that
to

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
happen okay going on down here anybody
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
has questions says I go please ask
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
them yes couple from the first page you
 
00:36:20.589 --> 00:36:20.599 align:start position:0%
don't sure go
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
ahead I might have missed it it's Point
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
number five spor or a co-sponsor of this
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
you may return to your seat but you will
 
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
not be recognized can you clarify that
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
please yes um represent M you may have
 
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
have uh have presented a bill you may be
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
sponsoring a bill and you're sitting out
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
there and you're presenting because
 
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
you're the first person to
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
present some of the committee me Members
 
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
prefer on a bill just go back to the
 
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
chairs and sit there throughout that
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
bill you are also allowed though by our
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
rules to come sit in your chair up here
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
on the committee but you cannot get into
 
00:37:02.309 --> 00:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
the conversation during that hearing
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
process you can't be asking other people
 
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
to testifying questions about that bill
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
is this an attempt to to avoid
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
micromanaging a bill that you're trying
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
to like shepher through you have
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
ownership on the bill so everybody knows
 
00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
where you where you are on that bill
 
00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
you're coming in then with a biased
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
position and so now you're asking
 
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
questions and that's giving you an
 
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify more than once
 
00:37:27.309 --> 00:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
but twice or three or four times if
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
you're using your position the the other
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
one was um I I assume if I come in to a
 
00:37:34.589 --> 00:37:34.599 align:start position:0%
meeting like on Thursday and I have
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
questions on my laptop that's not going
 
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
to be a problem or or an offense I'll
 
00:37:40.309 --> 00:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
just open the laptop and ask the
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
questions that are listed it's not in
 
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
terms of typing but it's just that kind
 
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
of thing would be okay if you're just
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
reading your questions that you pre pre
 
00:37:50.589 --> 00:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
right not typing but just just reading
 
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
things yeah let me let me give you
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
something an example that occurred um
 
00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
years and years ago we had several bill
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
come in regarding Northern path that was
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
the line coming down from uh Hydro
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
Quebec down through New
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that was a hearing that I
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
attended um and had a bill uh one of the
 
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
bills uh in in the hopper on that
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
particular and I was in the rep's
 
00:38:22.829 --> 00:38:22.839 align:start position:0%
hall and we had the lobbyist for one of
 
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
the organizations sitting out there
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
texting questions to people on the
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
committee to ask of other people
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
testifying that we don't want to happen
 
00:38:37.309 --> 00:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
so if you have your comp computer open
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
there and you're communicating with
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
people out there during the hearing
 
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
process that's a no no we don't do it
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
but if you're doing it if you just
 
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
essentially the same as having a
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
question on it but yeah so I probably
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
better to write them on the paper it
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
probably is because you're not going to
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
have a lot of time for a lot of
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
questions you know remember this is not
 
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
a debate this is a situation so you
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
should probably try to prioritize your
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
questions and as things go more
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
information comes out you may have
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
another one come up I understand that
 
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
but try to allow others on the committee
 
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
I in fact you can't ask a question until
 
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:21.640 align:start position:0%
you have permission from the chair to
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
ask that question I will try to ensure
 
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
that everybody has had an opportunity to
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
get what's on there you know
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
plate spoken to do you have
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
a thanks very much M Mr chair to um
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
representative mahan's first um question
 
00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah pardon me yet to um um to
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
represent mahan's first question um with
 
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
respect to co-sponsors who testify
 
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
during a hearing how about co-sponsors
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
on a bill who do not testify during a
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
hearing it depends on the chair um
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh those co-sponsors may
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
be able to ask questions if you're a
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor and you're not testifying but
 
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
you're sitting on this committee you can
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
ask questions good yeah that that that's
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
always been the practice of this but
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
usually when we're we're having for
 
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
example if you're asking a question
 
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:15.640 align:start position:0%
represent mahagan and you're getting an
 
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
answer you can follow up you can ask
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
permission of me to have a followup on
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
that to try and maybe get your your
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
question further
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
explained but I'm not going to go for
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up followup so so if
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
you want to follow up your question go
 
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:35.720 align:start position:0%
to the chair chair will say yay or nay
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
and you can ask the question I'd like to
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
say one last thing on a personal level I
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
I am extremely hearing impaired and so
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
if you see me poking on this it's really
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
to adjust the volume because at times
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
the volume uh doesn't quite come through
 
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
so I'll be poking on this sometimes as a
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
matter of convenience for the volume
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
just so that people know people who
 
00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
don't know me it's something that they
 
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
will say not to text but to fix thank
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
you okay that's something that those are
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
the types of uh things that I need to
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
know of because then I can also let Jen
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
for who is our committee researcher and
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
a lot more to do than just research and
 
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
we have a committee assistant too that
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
might help in terms of how we locate you
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
on the committee um my past experience
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
was I was came out of the military and
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
then went into education business became
 
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
a elementary teacher then principal
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
administrator and we always knew the
 
00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
kids in the class which had those types
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
of issues and we tried to seat them in
 
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
the right position okay the Acoustics in
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
this room are wonderful thank you so
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome going back to the
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
second page here yes uh yes just for for
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
the new new people in terms of a
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up question that um I might rule
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
I've been using is that it has to be
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
related to the first question you asked
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
that can't be a new question and also do
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
you watch for people to go like this or
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
you watch for people who turn on their
 
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
red light um when they want to ask a
 
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
question no I I look for the signal that
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
I have a question and then when you're
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
recognized then you put your red light
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
on okay thank
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
you um going on down here I'm trying to
 
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
find out where I dropped off here uh
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
something that I have not mentioned
 
00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.109 align:start position:0%
something that I have not mentioned
already

00:42:32.109 --> 00:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
um want to deal with the how we deal
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
with our clerk right here and
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative Brown is new to the game
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
but when we're in executive session and
 
00:42:45.309 --> 00:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
we've had our discussion and we're ready
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
to put the motion we're ready to go
 
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
ahead and take that
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
vote and we've we're going there and
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
before I always look to the clerk
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
because she's sorting through paperwork
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
here trying to get down because she's
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
going to have to do the roll call and
 
00:43:02.589 --> 00:43:02.599 align:start position:0%
it's done by roll
 
00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
call I will you know look at her and if
 
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
she's ready then I will again say the
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%

00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
OTP maybe otpa it may be itl it may be
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
to retain and we'll go through that when
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
we get into more exact session stuff but
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll I'll I'll say hb1 52 whatever
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
it might be and what that bills about
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
the motion is
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
OTP so everybody knows what we're voting
 
00:43:40.549 --> 00:43:40.559 align:start position:0%
on it's possible somebody may have just
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
walked in but you got to be in the
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
committee room in place here if if if
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
you can't walk in and we're also already
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
in that process of voting you're not
 
00:43:53.069 --> 00:43:53.079 align:start position:0%
going to be able to
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
vote now we've had a lot of situations
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
in the past where we've tried to
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
accommodate and we have we try to do
 
00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
that I often times work with the vice
 
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
chair and represent luno the ranking uh
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
representative here to make sure that we
 
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
know everybody's going to be here at a
 
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
certain time that we try to do but if
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
you're not here when it's put to the
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
Motions put then you're not going to be
 
00:44:23.069 --> 00:44:23.079 align:start position:0%
able to vote that's in our
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
rules house rules not Rick lad's rules
 
00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
okay going on down here I think you jump
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
which one did I jump over oh I did the
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
stickers starting here no
 
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittees this year we're we're
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
dealing with issues which are are
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
issues which have been dealt with every
 
00:44:52.829 --> 00:44:52.839 align:start position:0%
year since I've been here
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
funding back in uh 2011 when we put this
 
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
formula together every year thereafter
 
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
when be chopped and chiseled off the
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
sides 2018
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
20202 or the commission report that you
 
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
were on there represent L and I was on
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
the the issue
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
becomes when we're we're we're looking
 
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
at these bills which are coming
 
00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:25.309 align:start position:0%
at these bills which are coming
as

00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
um there may be a need for a work
 
00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
session and there will be with these
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
committees now when we're dealing with
 
00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.790 align:start position:0%
committees now when we're dealing with
the

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:38.119 align:start position:0%
funding and I prefer to use Committees
 
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
of the whole I've always been a
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
committee of the whole person other
 
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
words you know rather than choosing well
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to have two Dems and three
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
Republicans but I always make sure if
 
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
it's a committee to hold then the
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
chairman is the first named person of
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
course it's because it's a committee of
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
the whole when you're coming out of a
 
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee the report is made back to
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
the full committee and the the report is
 
00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
always made by the chair of the
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or the committee of the
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
whole I would make that recommendation
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
or or i' I'd appoint somebody to do it
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
because I shouldn't be making that
 
00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation unless I turn the gavel
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
over but when we have a smaller
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee then the subcommittee has
 
00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:27.559 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of doing the research
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
and Gathering research taking testimony
 
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
it's conducted just like a regular
 
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
hearing would be conducted and you also
 
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
then take action at the end of it just
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
like we did on the Joint Committee we
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
had last year which involved Ways and
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
Means finance and policy people we came
 
00:46:46.549 --> 00:46:46.559 align:start position:0%
up with
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations and then it comes back
 
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
to the education committee or the
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
funding committee here and the
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
recommendation that's made by the
 
00:46:58.109 --> 00:46:58.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is taken up first by the
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
whole committee so if the recommendation
 
00:47:01.599 --> 00:47:02.510 align:start position:0%
whole committee so if the recommendation
of

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee was to itl the bill
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
that recommendation would come from the
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
person who has given the responsibility
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
to be the chair of the
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and that is appointed by
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the full committee if we
 
00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
go that route and I'm sure we will I'm
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
sure we will go that year because one of
 
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
the things we're up against the clock as
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
we are right now but we're up against
 
00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
the clock we have people that're being
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
shared from Dual committees right from
 
00:47:30.319 --> 00:47:31.510 align:start position:0%
shared from Dual committees right from
other

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
committees and some like representative
 
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
F or represent pich uh Muller um and uh
 
00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire there are
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
Republicans here but they are also on
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
division two and effect of March
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
6 they're going to become very very busy
 
00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
people and so it it's it's we're going
 
00:47:58.990 --> 00:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
to have to hustle so we're going to have
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
to do a lot of our subcommittee work
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
early on and but we will continue just
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
because they have to go it doesn't mean
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
we have to stop working we're not going
 
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
to stop working we've taken a lot of
 
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
time in the past to look at some of
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
these bills which are are issues very
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
very complicated as you heard yesterday
 
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
it's not just special ed it's special
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
education Aid it's differentiated Aid
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
it's all those little innuendos and
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
nuances associated with
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
those topics which we have to get down
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
in and realize there's certain impacts
 
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
and there's money's coming from
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
different sources not just from the
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
education trust fund or the general fund
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
maybe from
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and how's that work in and
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
how's that impacting our costs and how
 
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
is it impacting our policy decisions on
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
delivering there delivering these
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
services to kids whether it be here or
 
00:48:55.789 --> 00:48:55.799 align:start position:0%
some student that you all read in the
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
papers what happened in
 
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
Tennessee that comes back and we have to
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
be addressing issues such as
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
that okay so that's how the subcommittee
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
process will work and we will engage
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
that I guarantee you we will be engaging
 
00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.030 align:start position:0%
that I guarantee you we will be engaging
that

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
process um executive session voting um
 
00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
just one thing we can retain bills in
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
the first year of the
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
bium interim study is a
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
motion that's made in the second year
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
retain bill means we retained it we
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
don't have enough information on it or
 
00:49:36.789 --> 00:49:36.799 align:start position:0%
we may be retaining it for another
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
reason there may be another bill that's
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the Senate that's very
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
similar we're just kind of waiting
 
00:49:44.109 --> 00:49:44.119 align:start position:0%
holding our cards find how things are
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
working there so we can move forward
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
with our retain Bill and maybe have to
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
Etc okay
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
um exact sessions okay chair recognizes
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
um I will on any motion made I will be
 
00:50:05.549 --> 00:50:05.559 align:start position:0%
recognizing the person to make the
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
motion um so uh that's pretty um the
 
00:50:15.789 --> 00:50:15.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:19.079 align:start position:0%
calendar I've oftentimes initially asked
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
what fiscal bill can any fiscal bills go
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
on consent and I have been told if the
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
costs are less than1
 
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
$1,000 which I see hers and Earth just
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
shaking yeah $110,000 is like tip money
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
but um when we're talking billion
 
00:50:40.589 --> 00:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
million um so yeah you can't put
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
something like that on but the vote has
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
to be at if it's a two people saying nay
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the committee saying yay
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
we can put it on consent if nobody
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
objects we may have an objection I will
 
00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
always ask
 
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
or somebody else may remind me to
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
ask consent like the placees on consent
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
I'll look around any objections to
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
placeing on
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
consent I won't see any hands flying up
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
so we'll put that on consent or there
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
may be one person objects I object to
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
putting that on
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
consent okay it's not going on consent
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
just because you vote no doesn't mean it
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
can't go on consent though if there's
 
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
two people that voted no I'll look at
 
00:51:26.549 --> 00:51:26.559 align:start position:0%
them are is there going to be any con
 
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
concern no okay we'll put on
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
consent the when we're not putting
 
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
something on consent the person that's
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
making the
 
00:51:39.309 --> 00:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
motion is the one and this is why
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have sometimes a hard time
 
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
getting somebody to make a
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
motion the committee report has to be
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
made by the person making the motion not
 
00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.109 align:start position:0%
made by the person making the motion not
has

00:51:50.109 --> 00:51:50.119 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
to unless you have a good buddy that can
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
write it for you and you agree to have
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
your buddy you write it and you put your
 
00:51:59.069 --> 00:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
name on underneath that but the
 
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
committee report and we used to call
 
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
this the blurb and you'll sometimes hear
 
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
me say the you have to write the blurb
 
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
I'm meaning the committee report that's
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
what goes into the calendar and the
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
calendar should reflect what happened in
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
the committee and we don't want to see
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
committee reports written from that
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
person's individual perspective and
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
stating some things which were never
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
said in the
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
committee those reports have to come
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
back also to to myself regardless of
 
00:52:32.109 --> 00:52:32.119 align:start position:0%
which party put forth the motion and
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
I'll check it over to make sure it's
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
expresses where we are and there's been
 
00:52:38.589 --> 00:52:38.599 align:start position:0%
of course in the past we've had real
 
00:52:40.789 --> 00:52:40.799 align:start position:0%
issues when it's been a 1010 vote we've
 
00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
had some issues with all that but they
 
00:52:45.549 --> 00:52:45.559 align:start position:0%
have to be approved by myself then they
 
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
will go on to our committee researcher
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
upstairs she'll look at it and then it
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
goes over to Paul Smith over the clerks
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
and to the speaker and the speaker has a
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
right to modify anything he
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
wants that's his job he can approve or
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
disapprove I can remember we used to
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
have a clerk not not our current C clerk
 
00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:07.640 align:start position:0%
that would check everything and make
 
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
sure we crossed our tees and dotted her
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
eyes in the right subject and right
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
predicate and the right verb it was all
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
that and that was pretty tough for some
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
people and but uh and she had us
 
00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.190 align:start position:0%
people and but uh and she had us
correcting

00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
correcting
 
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
that okay I think we're running out of
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
time here
 
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:25.720 align:start position:0%
um if somebody has to take a break
 
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
anywhere time and if you like to take a
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
recess you can we can call for that
 
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
there I I I agree that every now and
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
then we need to get up and we need
 
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
stretch and need to shake it off a
 
00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
little bit and then come back if
 
00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
somebody's getting to the point where
 
00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
they just got to get up and move give me
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
a signal and and we'll just call a short
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
recess a short break and and hit
 
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
off okay are there any questions because
 
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
we have a few minutes I I see we already
 
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
have one of our speakers
 
00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.710 align:start position:0%
have one of our speakers
here

00:53:59.710 --> 00:53:59.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
yeah per
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
me me
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
univ okay yeah yeah oh I didn't see
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
behind the
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
I yes represent fellows I just wondered
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to mention um about
 
00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
amendments that people have to you know
 
00:54:21.309 --> 00:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
bring in amendments if we will have a
 
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
number of amendments sometimes a person
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
that's testifying has an amendment
 
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
and the amendment they're saying here
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have this amendment you know
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
you taken up by the the
 
00:54:37.069 --> 00:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
committee the amendment won't be taken
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
up by the committee if in fact there is
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
not a Committee Member on or there's a
 
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
Committee Member on the committee here
 
00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
may want to take that and introduce it
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's fine that could be done like that
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
but sometimes we'll have other people
 
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
come in and say I got this amending
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
language that's
 
00:54:59.870 --> 00:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
you know we may take that information
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
and we may design an amendment but that
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
amendment is not Amendment we can only
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
do amendments which are introduced by
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
somebody on this
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
committee now I might be sitting there
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
with a bill that I've sponsored and say
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
I've got this amendment it's already
 
00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
made then I'm going to have copies of it
 
00:55:20.349 --> 00:55:20.359 align:start position:0%
available or somebody else on you may
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
have copies available for the committee
 
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
that's something that that's okay seeing
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
that the person introducing the bill is
 
00:55:29.309 --> 00:55:29.319 align:start position:0%
a member of this
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
committee so um if a senator comes in
 
00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
with an
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
amendment that
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
amendment is not going to has for us to
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
take care it has to have a
 
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
representative on this committee on that
 
00:55:46.029 --> 00:55:46.039 align:start position:0%
Amendment so we'd have to take that
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment and have it redrafted with a
 
00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
name of an individual or the or the
 
00:55:53.549 --> 00:55:53.559 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole on there uh before
 
00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:54.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to take action on that
 
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:57.799 align:start position:0%
Senate Amendment
 
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
any questions on that yes representative
 
00:56:02.589 --> 00:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
Burton not on that I had another
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
question I shouldn't have to say this
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
but uh when I was sitting at the seat my
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
last term a weapon came out of the purse
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
of one of the committee members and I I
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
would urge people if you are carrying a
 
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
weapon make sure the safety is on and
 
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
and better yet make sure it's unloaded
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
but it was a very traumatic moment over
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
here as you remember Mr chairman I
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
remember it thoroughly and WMUR
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
remembers it too because they were here
 
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
and there was a child on the
 
00:56:34.829 --> 00:56:34.839 align:start position:0%
floor and that parent remembers
 
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
too and you were testifying and you know
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
it wasn't not more than 30 seconds later
 
00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
I had a call from the
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
speaker and and of course we put recess
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
in and I we went across the hallway and
 
00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
had a little friendly chat and I won't
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
say where it went from there but it was
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
handled very very very quickly and and
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
security can be here in just like that
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
um so I'm glad you brought that up uh
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
represent Burton um yes we've had
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
several situations like that where
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
weapons have dropped out onto the floor
 
00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
not just in here but elsewhere in the
 
00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.069 align:start position:0%
not just in here but elsewhere in the
facilities

00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:57:16.829 --> 00:57:16.839 align:start position:0%
so take care of them you know if you if
 
00:57:18.029 --> 00:57:18.039 align:start position:0%
you if you're
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
caring further questions okay let's take
 
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
a few minute break here stretch out a
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
little bit and we'll come back cuz we do
 
00:57:29.309 --> 00:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
have the chancellors are both here now
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
and we'll start up in a few moments yeah
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%

01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
SLE okay everybody we're going to
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
countown here
 
01:09:59.870 --> 01:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
um and try to get everybody in their
 
01:10:01.709 --> 01:10:01.719 align:start position:0%
seats this is the hard thing when we
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
take breaks all the squirrels start
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
playing and it's hard to get everything
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
back in chairs but I we really do have
 
01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
to get going and I want to be fair and
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
give about a half hour to each one of
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
our our schools and our levels of
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
Education here and so just because we're
 
01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
starting a little late doesn't mean that
 
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
we're U going to necessarily stop right
 
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
at 12 there'll be some slippage on that
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
that so with this today higher education
 
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
is um an a topic that many many states
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
when it comes to legislation have a
 
01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
separate committee for higher education
 
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
period and and uh they then have K
 
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
through 12 and some of them have as many
 
01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
as three separate committees but they
 
01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
don't meet as often as we do as as but
 
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
right now we're recognizing with all the
 
01:10:59.910 --> 01:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
issues that are facing us CER technical
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
education and and higher education
 
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
they're not in separate silos
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily we're starting to see that
 
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
there's a blending from K through 12
 
01:11:15.149 --> 01:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
right through to K through
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
16 and we've had a task force just
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
recently I'll take just a second or two
 
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
more where it was put together by the
 
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
governor this last year and we were
 
01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
looking at issues associated with higher
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
education alignment strategies
 
01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.750 align:start position:0%
education alignment strategies
efficiencies

01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
efficiencies
 
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
access um
 
01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
affordability transferability of credit
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
all those issues we are looking at which
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
are necessary because they're impacting
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
our Workforce and and careers and those
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
Pathways and the pathway just doesn't
 
01:11:51.149 --> 01:11:51.159 align:start position:0%
start when you become a high school
 
01:11:53.629 --> 01:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
graduate it starts when you're right in
 
01:11:56.189 --> 01:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
the Elementary grades and we start
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
talking about for example the trades in
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
the middle school and we go on with that
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
and we kind of uh bring it right to the
 
01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
high school and we've opened that up to
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
grades 10 11 12 in the CTE but also
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester has at 9 10 11 and 12 and so
 
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
education now is becoming very involved
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
at all levels in terms of these topics
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
and so today I think it's very important
 
01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
that we um start looking at and thinking
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
about those 40 some odd recommendations
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
short and long-term initiatives that
 
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
came out of the governor's task force
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
which he put together and that was a
 
01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
result of hb1
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
1450 and transferability of credit HB
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
1530 and so today we're going to have
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
just some starters here some information
 
01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
for us available on what's going on with
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
higher education in terms of the
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
University system the community college
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
system um so I'd like to invite right
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
now the folks we flipped the coin or
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
maybe they mutually agreed upon it uh
 
01:13:06.669 --> 01:13:06.679 align:start position:0%

provide some orientation to the
 
01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
committee um some of the information in
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
my material um which was passed out
 
01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
during the break may seem basic but just
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
want to try to level set for everyone
 
01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy obviously and always to
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
take any questions so the university
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
system on page one is three institutions
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
University of New hampsh Plymouth State
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
University Keane State
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
College the University of New Hampshire
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
and Durham Plymouth and Kean are
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
residential campuses there's a law
 
01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:39.400 align:start position:0%
school um with UNH here in conquer and
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
then UNH Manchester is obviously in
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester more of a commuter College
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
our total enrollment this fall is
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
23,000 19,000 of those are undergraduate
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
so about 83% of our total enrollment is
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
undergraduate and UNH makes up about 69%
 
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
of that total enrollment plymouths at
 
01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:06.679 align:start position:0%
17% and keen's at 14% our total
 
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
operating expenses last fiscal year were
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
$928 million we're a very large
 
01:15:13.199 --> 01:15:14.750 align:start position:0%
$928 million we're a very large
Enterprise

01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
Enterprise
 
01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
20% of that spend is related to direct
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
research expenditures and research
 
01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
expenditures have grown
 
01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
75% since
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
2019 uh UNH is what's categorized as an
 
01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
R1 University in the Carn Carnegie
 
01:15:35.709 --> 01:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
classification of higher education
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
institutions it's the top rank if you
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
will of research institutions only 4% of
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
highered institutions in the country are
 
01:15:49.830 --> 01:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
R1 and UNH for a University at size is a
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
little Powerhouse of research and
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
Innovation I'll talk a little bit more
 
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
about that later but but um really
 
01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
providing students with an unbelievable
 
01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
experience and partnering with business
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%

Workforce here in New Hampshire
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
the university system has a $3.7 billion
 
01:16:31.709 --> 01:16:31.719 align:start position:0%
economic impact on the state annually we
 
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
work with businesses directly our
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
faculty work with businesses across the
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
state to inform long-term curriculum

the long
 
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:44.600 align:start position:0%

01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
thousands of businesses across the state
 
01:16:49.709 --> 01:16:49.719 align:start position:0%
and that that provides close connection
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
between the employers and our students
 
01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
our graduates and the research
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
Enterprise and you you're probably
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
familiar with Cooperative Extension
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's affiliated with UNH we have reach
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%

State Plymouth State and Keen state are
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
deeply embedded in the regions of our
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
state where they're located so Plymouth
 
01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
in The Lakes Region of North Country
 
01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
region on slide four I just want to
 
01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
provide like an undergraduate profile
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
because that's the vast majority of our
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
our student body as I mentioned earlier
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
our undergraduate enrollment this fall
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
is about 19,000 52% of those are New
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents 30% of our um
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
College goers are first generation so
 
01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
they're the first generation in their
 
01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
family to attend college 86 6% of our
 
01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
students receive financial aid and we
 
01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
have um the highest graduation rate at
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
The Bachelor level of All publics in New
 
01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
England and the top majors business
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
health profession psychology biology
 
01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
Communications and
 
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
Engineering okay so on Slide Five where
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
does the state investment
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
go so this fiscal year fiscal 25 the
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
university system was fortunate enough
 
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
to receive 95 million in state support
 
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
um from the um general fund
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
budget of the 95 million about $81
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
million directly buys down instate
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
tuition for New Hampshire students so
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire resident tuition is less
 
01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
than half of what tuition is charged for
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
out of state students and that over like
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
$7,000 per student is supported by the
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
state to buy down the tuition and make
 
01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
it more affordable for our New Hampshire
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
residents to attend school here and then
 
01:19:08.229 --> 01:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
the the balance of the appropriation
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
provides most of much of the support not
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
all of it for statutorily mandated
 
01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
programs so Cooperative Extension
 
01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
agricultural experiment station I'll
 
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
also say um pursuant to statute uh
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
National Guard receives free to tuition
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
so their tuition waivers their foster
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
care children receive tuition waivers
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
that's not included in here that's about
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
another $3 million a year in providing
 
01:19:37.870 --> 01:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
tuition waivers for um National Guard
 
01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
boster care and and other um statutory
 
01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
requirements me keep going here so on
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
slide six because of increased State
 
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
Support over the past six years we've
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
held instate tuition flat for six years
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
so during a period of high inflation now
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
I'll also say enrollment has been
 
01:20:02.350 --> 01:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
declining I'll get to that in a minute
 
01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
our enrollment has been
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
declining and actually that's happening
 
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
all around New England but be excuse me
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
because we've been able to keep New
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident tuition flat and
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
increased financial aid we've increase
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
the amount of financial aid our net
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
tuition and fees for New Hampshire
 
01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
residents has actually gone down
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
years and on slide
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
seven that's where we talk about
 
01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:41.510 align:start position:0%
seven that's where we talk about
enrollment

01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:43.110 align:start position:0%
enrollment
declining

01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
declining
 
01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
so and I'm sure you're all aware that we
 
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
have the demographics in New England and
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
many regions of the country um are we we
 
01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
have fewer high school graduates right
 
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
there's a a smaller pipeline so and in
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
New England where we have so many
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
colleges right there are colleges and
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
University many colleges and
 
01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
universities in New England and so the
 
01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
competition is fierce because the number
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
of students are on the
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
decline and our we're no different our
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
total enrollment since 2019 has dropped
 
01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.790 align:start position:0%
total enrollment since 2019 has dropped
about

01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
133% for the first time this fall for
 
01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
the first time since the fall of
 
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
2012 the number of our New Hampshire
 
01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.629 align:start position:0%
2012 the number of our New Hampshire
students

01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
increased and and I think in large part
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
because we've been able to keep tuition
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
flat because of State support and and um
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
and financial aid through various
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
financial aid
 
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
programs so we did see an uptick this
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
um this this this is the worrisome chart
 
01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
because demographics show that
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
enrollment will continue to decline
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
because there are fewer
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
students and frankly this
 
01:22:13.390 --> 01:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
isn't as much about the university
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
system as it is about the pipeline for
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
the future and Workforce we know from
 
01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
working with business and Bia Workforce
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
housing and childcare are the top three
 
01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
concerns that Mo most of business and
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
industry yeah worry about and with fewer
 
01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
folks in the
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
pipeline how do we ensure that we have
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
an educated
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
Workforce half a dozen years from now
 
01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
and again this is happening all over New
 
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
England so and other states actually are
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
doubling down in their investment to
 
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
keep their their students in their
 
01:22:55.229 --> 01:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
states or to attract our students out of
 
01:22:57.629 --> 01:22:57.639 align:start position:0%
state Maine is a good example you might
 
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
have seen Billboards up and down the 95
 
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
on you can go to the University of Maine
 
01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
for the same tuition that you would pay
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
in state and that's all of New England
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
New York and New Jersey Sunni also has a
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
big social media campaign come to Sunni
 
01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
for the same price you'd pay in your own
 
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
State um UMass L if you live within a
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
50- mile radius you can have instate
 
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
tuition well what's a 50- m radius from
 
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
L the population centers of New
 
01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so the competition is fierce
 
01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
because folks
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
recognize we could have a problem with
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
Workforce as the number of as the
 
01:23:46.669 --> 01:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.470 --> 01:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
decline okay so what are we doing about
 
01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
it on Slide N what's the University
 
01:23:54.510 --> 01:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
system doing about it we know at as
 
01:23:56.669 --> 01:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
enrollment declines we need to keep
 
01:23:58.590 --> 01:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
reduce our cost structure that the math
 
01:24:01.709 --> 01:24:01.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't work if we don't so over the
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
last 5 years we have reduced faculty and
 
01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
staff headcount our full-time faculty is
 
01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
down about 5 and a half% our part-time
 
01:24:11.070 --> 01:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
not our full-time fa our fulltime
 
01:24:14.189 --> 01:24:14.199 align:start position:0%
employee headcount is down 5 a half% our
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
part-time employee headcount is down
 
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
19% I I looked at and you might say why
 
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
does she keep going back to 19 with
 
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
because I try to go back pre-co covid um
 
01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
makes Trend analysis difficult um over
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
that period since 2009 no let me qualify
 
01:24:40.030 --> 01:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit I'm not including Grant
 
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
funded positions because when grants
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
increase 75% over 5 years I you know I
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
pulled that out because there are
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
employees that work on the grant side
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
over that 5-year period our toal total
 
01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:55.830 align:start position:0%
over that 5-year period our toal total
employee

01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
compensation wages medical benefits
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
retirement contributions over that since
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
2019 grew
 
01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
2% in a period where inflation Rose 23%
 
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
so again and you can tell that in our
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
the number of our headcount has come
 
01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
down as our enrollments come
 
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
down that's not enough we've reduced
 
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
retirement contributions we've reduced
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
the medical plan and increased premiums
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
we've um sold buildings we're
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
demolishing buildings we're exiting
 
01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
leases actually we're the system office
 
01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
is exiting the lease that's it it is in
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
and we're moving on to the nhti campus
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
here in conquer later this year um and
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
we just went live uh we did make a big
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
investment in a new Erp it's enterprise
 
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
resource planning it's the it's the
 
01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
technology that runs HR Finance we're
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
working on
 
01:25:59.390 --> 01:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
student um that technology that that we
 
01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
had SL have was 30 years
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
old and so we just went live December
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
21st with a new HR and finance to make
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
business process more efficient and over
 
01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
time we expect
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
technology well let me ask
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
still Chancellor U well she been she
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
both yeah um are do you want to take
 
01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
questions now or at the end or do you
 
01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
want to get through first what whatever
 
01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:43.639 align:start position:0%
is best for the committee okay why don't
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
we we'll take one question right now
 
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
represent luno so thank you very much Mr
 
01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much Chancellor for
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
um for um as you're sort of getting into
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
the the the go the business plan plan
 
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
going forward I wanted to sort of back
 
01:26:59.950 --> 01:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
up to um to page eight which seems to be
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
the the demographic data that that's
 
01:27:05.109 --> 01:27:05.119 align:start position:0%
driving the business plan and we talked
 
01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
quite about quite a bit about this and
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
Chancellor rumstein was was along with
 
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
you and and chair lad myself on the on
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
the that Governor's um higher education
 
01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:19.119 align:start position:0%
task force but we talked about the uh
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
the changes in demographic data and and
 
01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
um and how
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
that how how how this this you know line
 
01:27:33.629 --> 01:27:33.639 align:start position:0%
um is following I think you mentioned
 
01:27:35.229 --> 01:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
you know number of high school graduates
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
or something like that but clearly
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
there's a large percentage of high
 
01:27:41.950 --> 01:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
school graduates in New Hampshire that
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
are that are not attending not seeking
 
01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
post-secondary opportunities and I was
 
01:27:53.109 --> 01:27:53.119 align:start position:0%
wondering to what extent do do those um
 
01:27:56.430 --> 01:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
high school graduates become a a um
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
whatever the term is addressable Market
 
01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:01.719 align:start position:0%
or available market for um for higher
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
education and could could could seeking
 
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
to grow our customer base beyond the
 
01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
traditional customer base be um uh be be
 
01:28:16.189 --> 01:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
something that um you know that that
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
would maybe you know help change this
 
01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
trajectory so I I think 100% um Jen
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
Rubenstein and I talked talk about this
 
01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
I just met with the new director of the
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
nhcu Micah Stark yesterday um Christiana
 
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
Thornton at Granite advance I I do think
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
state and our our future Workforce and
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
economy that is an opport that is an
 
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity set because so many of our
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
um as you mentioned representative luno
 
01:28:51.109 --> 01:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
there are a number of students in high
 
01:28:51.119 --> 01:28:52.109 align:start position:0%
there are a number of students in high
school

01:28:52.109 --> 01:28:52.119 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
that going to school Beyond High School
 
01:28:58.350 --> 01:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
is not even a twinkle in their eye and
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
as you know we need folks in the trades
 
01:29:02.109 --> 01:29:02.119 align:start position:0%
we need folks with certificates we need
 
01:29:03.790 --> 01:29:03.800 align:start position:0%
folks with bachelor's degrees we need
 
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
folks with Advanced degrees to have a
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
robust economy so how do we tackle
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
that actually my board's having a
 
01:29:16.990 --> 01:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
presentation in June on what we're doing
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
between Grant and advance in the
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
University system to reach down to to
 
01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
middle school because I think that's
 
01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
frankly I think that's where we need to
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
really reach down in middle school so
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
that folks are aware of Early College
 
01:29:31.709 --> 01:29:31.719 align:start position:0%
opportunities when you think about it
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
early college opportunities you get
 
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
college credit in high school that could
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
lead to a pathway to the community
 
01:29:41.629 --> 01:29:41.639 align:start position:0%
college system and I'll talk a little
 
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
bit more about we now have a hundred
 
01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:45.400 align:start position:0%
Pathways from the community college
 
01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
system to the university
 
01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
system so for for those folks that's a
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
really I I think a more affordable
 
01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:55.400 align:start position:0%
option um
 
01:29:57.510 --> 01:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
um but I think we need to be a little
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
more intentional about how we reach down
 
01:30:00.990 --> 01:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
to the middle school and we're not there
 
01:30:03.149 --> 01:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
yet but I do think that is an
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity set for the community
 
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
college system the university system and
 
01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
again frankly it's really about our
 
01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
quality of life here in New Hampshire
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
and the economy and the workforce in the
 
01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
future I think you just gave a wonderful
 
01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
introduction to Mark you in terms of
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
concurrent du enrollment and some of
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
those programs we have working for us
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
chanc robenstein and I are spending a
 
01:30:27.310 --> 01:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
lot lot of quality time together
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yes ask a question um can uh
 
01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
represent Burton pardon me it just
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
follows on with you as long as you we
 
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to take all Cathy's time from
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
her but go ahead do a quick one the last
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
time I think we met C uh Chancellor was
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
when we I I sponsored the
 
01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
6525 resolution uh 5 years ago that we
 
01:30:58.990 --> 01:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
would reach 65% of the workforce with a
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
post High School
 
01:31:03.390 --> 01:31:03.400 align:start position:0%
credential in in 5 years by
 
01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
2025 at the time New Hampshire was
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
sitting around
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
48% I have since talked to the Bia about
 
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
the possibility of renewing that goal
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
with a goal of
 
01:31:17.109 --> 01:31:17.119 align:start position:0%
70% with a high post High School
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
credential by
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
2030 does that fit in any way with what
 
01:31:25.950 --> 01:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
something we might want to
 
01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.709 align:start position:0%
something we might want to
do

01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
possibly I I um that sounds like a
 
01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely laudable
 
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
goal I need to give some thought you
 
01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
know I'd like to talk to others I'd like
 
01:31:43.709 --> 01:31:43.719 align:start position:0%
to give some thought to how that works
 
01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:47.800 align:start position:0%
what the cost is um I I I'll tell you
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
that at every corner right now we are
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
trying to reduce administrative cost we
 
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
don't have a choice you don't have much
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:32:00.189 --> 01:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
margin oh we're absolutely it's exactly
 
01:32:03.709 --> 01:32:03.719 align:start position:0%
there's there's a very limited margin we
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
know we have to continue drilling down
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
into the cost structure so every
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
everything's um I don't want to make it
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
sound all about money but as the former
 
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
State Treasurer right now for higher ed
 
01:32:18.510 --> 01:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
it's all about money so we need to make
 
01:32:20.189 --> 01:32:20.199 align:start position:0%
sure we're meeting our
 
01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
mission thinking about what we're doing
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's not part of our mission
 
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
and um that's that's a long answer but
 
01:32:30.510 --> 01:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
but to point out I don't think that
 
01:32:34.030 --> 01:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
study was done by HED it was done by a a
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
separate entity paid for by Delta Dental
 
01:32:41.550 --> 01:32:41.560 align:start position:0%
paid for by the Bia and other people it
 
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:43.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think it was any cost to the
 
01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
university system or the okay let's
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
let's move on though because we have
 
01:32:51.310 --> 01:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
questions and we probably need a whole
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
day on this but uh okay go ahead I can I
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
can move very quickly through these
 
01:32:59.470 --> 01:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
through these the rest of my I only have
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
a couple slides left take your time and
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
I I just want to um make sure folks are
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
aware of the Partnerships that we do
 
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
have across the state as um chairman lad
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
just mentioned um the community college
 
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
system and the university system are
 
01:33:19.870 --> 01:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
partnering on many levels with these
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
transfer Pathways that have just been
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
announced um a direct admit program
 
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
where community college students will be
 
01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
directly admitted into the university
 
01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
system seamlessly if they meet
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria uh we have a
 
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
multitude of
 
01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
administrative collaborations that are
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
going on I mentioned we're moving the
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
system office to the nhti campus I I
 
01:33:45.629 --> 01:33:45.639 align:start position:0%
just we we um the state as a whole can
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
really benefit by close partnership
 
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
between our two systems of public higher
 
01:33:54.669 --> 01:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
education um again UNH and the
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
university system critical to the future
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's Workforce New
 
01:33:59.950 --> 01:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Life Sciences we're deeply
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
involved with with that group um the
 
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
advanced manufacturing initiative
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
through the Bea we're involved in that
 
01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
initiative um and internships I can't
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
say enough about internships we know
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
that out ofate students are twice as
 
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
likely to stay and work here in New
 
01:34:17.470 --> 01:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if they participated in an
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
internship over 75% of our students do
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
participate in an internship 74 4% are
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire companies we have over
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
500 um internship locations across the
 
01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
state with businesses and
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
employers and um it's also about
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
Innovation and that's you know you might
 
01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
say well why should I why should
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
research matter why should it matter
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
that the university system particularly
 
01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
UNH has increased research 75% since
 
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
2019 gets back to Innovation working
 
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
with business giving students Hands-On
 
01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
experienced with that research
 
01:34:58.990 --> 01:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
Enterprise and the other um just a
 
01:35:01.109 --> 01:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
couple other things Plymouth State you
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
we need to meet our students where they
 
01:35:05.070 --> 01:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
are Plymouth State received approval
 
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
from Nei which is the New England
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
accrediting body in the fall to offer
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
five I'm going to call them I call them
 
01:35:15.390 --> 01:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
three-year bachelor's degrees but
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
they're applied bachelor's degrees with
 
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
less than 120 credits that a student can
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
finish in three years cyber security
 
01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
business Polie studies robotics outdoor
 
01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
Venture leadership I don't know if
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
you're aware there is a industry over in
 
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
the madok region Precision manufacturing
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
Diamond turning Optics lab with like the
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
global leader in Diamond turning Optics
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
and Keen state is the only four-year
 
01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
College selected by the American Center
 
01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
of Optics manufacturing to partner with
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
and theyve ke now through Federal
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
funding has an Optics d interning lab
 
01:35:56.109 --> 01:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
over there there are a thousand people
 
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
working in this industry in six
 
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
companies over in the madok region I
 
01:36:03.070 --> 01:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned the research um UNH is a
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
little Powerhouse for an institution at
 
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
size and if you've never had an
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go to the John olssen
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
Advanced manufacturing center over at
 
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
UNH I would be happy to
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
um try to organize a tour because you'd
 
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
be amazed at the collaboration with high
 
01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
school students community college
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
students University system students
 
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
businesses it's all advanced
 
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and um it it it's a and
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
and we have a number of companies that
 
01:36:37.470 --> 01:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
are Co collocated there so again just
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
examples of
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
the the tremendous asset that the
 
01:36:43.950 --> 01:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
university system is to the state and
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
our future and the last slide is just
 
01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:48.679 align:start position:0%
contact information I think the chairman
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
can confirm that if anyone at any time
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
has questions um feel free to shoot me
 
01:36:59.550 --> 01:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
an email text call I will do my very
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
best to get answers to your questions
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
even today I might not be able to answer
 
01:37:04.990 --> 01:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
all your questions but I will try my
 
01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
very best to get answers thank you very
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
much uh are there questions from the
 
01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:12.109 align:start position:0%
much uh are there questions from the
committee

01:37:12.109 --> 01:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative y thank you Mr chair and
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question it's
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
actually two sort of related questions
 
01:37:21.629 --> 01:37:21.639 align:start position:0%
um could you just comment
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
about the 5 2% of un students or maybe
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
of the whole system are New Hampshire
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
residents and is that a Target
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
or you know is there a particular effort
 
01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
and then parallel to that how does our
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
outof state tuition compare with other
 
01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
New England
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
universities because I noticed that
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
we've decreased in the number of out of
 
01:37:49.390 --> 01:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
state tuition students seems like more
 
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
than just the overall decrease in uh
 
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment thank you so the 52% is not a
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
Target we accept all New Hampshire
 
01:37:59.550 --> 01:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
students who are eligible that want to
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
attend uh so so let's remember with
 
01:38:06.030 --> 01:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment declining we have plenty of
 
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
capacity so New Hampshire students are
 
01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
not um being denied entry at all um
 
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
again the competition in New
 
01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
England there you know there's a I hate
 
01:38:24.589 --> 01:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
to say there's a on every street corner
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
almost in New England right we have a
 
01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
lot of competition so no we that's not a
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
Target we'd love to have more New
 
01:38:34.589 --> 01:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students um but they have lots
 
01:38:34.599 --> 01:38:35.430 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students um but they have lots
of

01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
options and um on out of state again
 
01:38:42.669 --> 01:38:42.679 align:start position:0%
especially with other public flagships
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's primarily our
 
01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:46.589 align:start position:0%
that's primarily our
competition

01:38:46.589 --> 01:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
competition
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
um other states are doubling down so um
 
01:38:57.390 --> 01:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:00.159 align:start position:0%
yeah we we can did you mention anything
 
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
about gr Granite guarantee you know how
 
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
how we're helping out with you know we
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
see the tuition rates here but what the
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
the student that is needing help where
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
there to actually is and one thing the
 
01:39:16.629 --> 01:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
trustees we we've done we've we want to
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
hold the line saying this is a college
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
available to all our New Hampshire
 
01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
students on opposed to Vermont where 80
 
01:39:25.149 --> 01:39:25.159 align:start position:0%
percent of their students are out of
 
01:39:29.310 --> 01:39:29.320 align:start position:0%
state students in in our state what was
 
01:39:31.510 --> 01:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
that percentage we we stated the other
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
day Kathy was around 50 some odd percent
 
01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
that were we're we we're where we want
 
01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
to be well 52% of our students are New
 
01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:40.870 align:start position:0%
to be well 52% of our students are New
Hampshire

01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:39:44.589 --> 01:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
residents um but again we have capacity
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
for we'd like to have more out of state
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
and more instate
 
01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:49.950 align:start position:0%
and more instate
students

01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah no one one question yes go
 
01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:54.589 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah no one one question yes go
ahead

01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I I am the
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
father of eight children three four of
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
which were part of the UN University
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
system three to Keen one to Plymouth and
 
01:40:09.149 --> 01:40:09.159 align:start position:0%
one to you no two to three no five of
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
the eight the two youngest decided not
 
01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
to go to any University at all because
 
01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
of the number that you put on slide
 
01:40:19.470 --> 01:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
number four to me it's terrifying to see
 
01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
that 86% receive financial aid what that
 
01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
means is 8 86% of our University
 
01:40:27.709 --> 01:40:27.719 align:start position:0%
students have aced egregious debt it's
 
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
not just small debt it's it's the size
 
01:40:31.709 --> 01:40:31.719 align:start position:0%
of a decent car that they have to pay
 
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
off when they come out so my question is
 
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
um is there any way that you guys have
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
put because I know of the capabilities
 
01:40:41.229 --> 01:40:41.239 align:start position:0%
that you guys have and the reason why my
 
01:40:43.629 --> 01:40:43.639 align:start position:0%
children chose you uh is there any
 
01:40:45.470 --> 01:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
reason is there any thing that you've
 
01:40:49.470 --> 01:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
done where you can also mitigate that
 
01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
debt upon coming out the connection
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
between release
 
01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
the ending of the term and the
 
01:40:58.510 --> 01:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
graduating with a degree and getting in
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
to a position where they can relieve
 
01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
themselves of that debt would be an
 
01:41:05.589 --> 01:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
awesome draw to anybody wanting to go
 
01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
well I think that so our we do a a
 
01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
destination survey at the end of every
 
01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
year six months actually after the end
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
of of every year and the vast majority
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
of our students our graduates are I
 
01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
think it's like 90 5% are either
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
employed or in a like maybe they went to
 
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
grad school um telling us that
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
um their their
 
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
degree did what they wanted it to do and
 
01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
got them a job um I I would add that the
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
86% receiving financial aid might not
 
01:41:48.030 --> 01:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean
 
01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
loans so let me use representative lad's
 
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
example if you are a New Hampshire pel
 
01:41:58.669 --> 01:41:58.679 align:start position:0%
eligible student um there is a granted
 
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
guarantee program and we will the
 
01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
university system will cover your
 
01:42:05.310 --> 01:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
tuition it's a last dollar scholarship
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
but if you're a needy New Hampshire
 
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
student you won't pay tuition
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
now room and board is not covered and
 
01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
that is still expensive so there are
 
01:42:19.589 --> 01:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
other options right there are there are
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
options with the pathways from the
 
01:42:23.149 --> 01:42:23.159 align:start position:0%
community college system to the
 
01:42:26.550 --> 01:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
University system um we have an online
 
01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
option so I I understand exactly what
 
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
you're saying representative that that
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
um I was going to offer my I'm now I
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
have my my old State Treasurer hat
 
01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
on and um I think a lot of it has to do
 
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
with financial literacy of the citizenry
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
in this country as a whole and
 
01:42:53.709 --> 01:42:53.719 align:start position:0%
um if people and Granite advant helps
 
01:42:56.350 --> 01:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
with this Granite Advance helps with
 
01:42:59.070 --> 01:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
this if people understood what it was
 
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
going to mean to take out $100,000 of
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
debt or whatever it is um well K red
 
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
would prob would have to react
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
differently I suppose but
 
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
um it's certainly a a huge issue in the
 
01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
country I I
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
totally understand
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
that okay there going to be a lot of
 
01:43:25.350 --> 01:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
questions on higher education here
 
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
I represent am I'll take that last
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
question but then I want to switch over
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
to the community college system because
 
01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
they have their half hour still coming
 
01:43:36.589 --> 01:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
up as well go ahead May easy one what
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
extent do you rely on federal funding
 
01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
and what prospects for change are you
 
01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:45.070 align:start position:0%
and what prospects for change are you
thinking

01:43:45.070 --> 01:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
01:43:47.629 --> 01:43:47.639 align:start position:0%
about that that's an excellent question
 
01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative um because that that
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
um the Grant dollars I mentioned that
 
01:43:58.030 --> 01:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
have increased 75% and drive so much
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
Innovation and research in the state
 
01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's almost all federally funded
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
so we don't know what will H you know
 
01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:07.149 align:start position:0%
so we don't know what will H you know
what

01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
what we do know right there will be a a
 
01:44:12.669 --> 01:44:12.679 align:start position:0%
government efficiency Department that
 
01:44:12.679 --> 01:44:13.629 align:start position:0%
government efficiency Department that
could

01:44:13.629 --> 01:44:13.639 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
impact federal grants we don't know but
 
01:44:20.109 --> 01:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
we'll have to Pivot if the if the grants
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
if the grants dry up well then they're
 
01:44:25.709 --> 01:44:25.719 align:start position:0%
then that would I think that would be
 
01:44:29.470 --> 01:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
terrible for innovation in the state but
 
01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
um we'll have to Pivot the other the
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
other big Federal number and just
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
forgive me while I look at my financial
 
01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
statements um the other big Federal
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
number is the pel grants and so last
 
01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal year um we had $22 million in
 
01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:49.159 align:start position:0%
federal pel grants and I haven't heard
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
that the pel grants are going to be
 
01:44:52.709 --> 01:44:52.719 align:start position:0%
pulled back but but that could be
 
01:44:52.719 --> 01:44:54.030 align:start position:0%
pulled back but but that could be
another

01:44:54.030 --> 01:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
impact so it's on our radar um we're
 
01:44:59.790 --> 01:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
keeping plugged in with various
 
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
associations and um to make sure that
 
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
you know we understand what What's um as
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
well as our federal delegation to so we
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
understand what the impacts are before
 
01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
they before they arrive on our
 
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
doorstep thank you thank you very very
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
much this is huge and we'll probably
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
have to invite you back for more
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
information as as we move anytime
 
01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:27.070 --> 01:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
well Chancellor Rubenstein community
 
01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:29.470 align:start position:0%
well Chancellor Rubenstein community

01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
Reed you know take your half hour
 
01:45:50.430 --> 01:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
because you
 
01:45:52.669 --> 01:45:52.679 align:start position:0%
know just like a football game you know
 
01:45:55.390 --> 01:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
some choose to receive some and some
 
01:45:59.470 --> 01:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
choose to kick I don't know well thank
 
01:46:01.950 --> 01:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you members of
 
01:46:03.589 --> 01:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record Mark
 
01:46:05.470 --> 01:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
Rubenstein Chancellor for the community
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
college system of New Hampshire joined
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
by my
 
01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
colleague hi Shannon Reed director of
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
government Affairs and Communications
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
welcome if you don't mind before I get
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
to the actual presentation
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative lad when you began the
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
earlier part of the discussion with
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
chancell preventure you had remarked
 
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
that in some states higher education is
 
01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
moved to a different committee and here
 
01:46:36.910 --> 01:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
we do this together and I I think
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
there's a logic to it because in so many
 
01:46:44.189 --> 01:46:44.199 align:start position:0%
ways and it was touched on by chancell
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
prenter as well education is really
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
increasingly importantly seamless prek
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
through lifelong learning
 
01:46:55.950 --> 01:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
and we often get hung up on the
 
01:46:59.149 --> 01:46:59.159 align:start position:0%
demographics when we think about the K
 
01:47:01.629 --> 01:47:01.639 align:start position:0%
through2 population in particular in
 
01:47:03.589 --> 01:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
fact the task force that you mentioned
 
01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
that Governor sonunu had charged last
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
year when Chancellor prevention and I
 
01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
were providing our respective
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
presentations we both drew the same
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
slide from New Hampshire Department of
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
Education that showed that between 2003
 
01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:17.229 align:start position:0%
Education that showed that between 2003
and

01:47:17.229 --> 01:47:17.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
2023 the state had seen about a 22% drop
 
01:47:23.790 --> 01:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
in K through 12 enrollment about 35,000
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
fewer students and that's not
 
01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
insignificant for any of us but that's
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
only part of the story and increasingly
 
01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
what we recognize is that it's not just
 
01:47:37.390 --> 01:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
the demographics but it's the education
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
itself that's changing or needs to
 
01:47:43.629 --> 01:47:43.639 align:start position:0%
change when I was in high school my
 
01:47:45.629 --> 01:47:45.639 align:start position:0%
guidance counselor never told me that
 
01:47:49.390 --> 01:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
you could use a 3D printer to produce a
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
pancreas there are jobs and industries
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
and opportunities that just didn't exist
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
now that that that's 45 years
 
01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
ago but 10 years ago guidance counselors
 
01:48:02.669 --> 01:48:02.679 align:start position:0%
weren't necessarily talking about this
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
and who knows what 10 years from now
 
01:48:06.510 --> 01:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
will bring that we're still not talking
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%
about and that has implications because
 
01:48:11.709 --> 01:48:11.719 align:start position:0%
to have the workforce that's available
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
for industries that are just
 
01:48:16.109 --> 01:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
emerging we're not going to strand the
 
01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
majority of the population and tell them
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
they were born too soon to participate
 
01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
we've got to be able to make education
 
01:48:24.270 --> 01:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
accessible to working adults throughout
 
01:48:26.830 --> 01:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
their lifetimes not just because new
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
Industries will emerge who knows when
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
the next regenerative medicine
 
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity but just in terms of how
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
people's lives
 
01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
unfold we offer associate degree in
 
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
certificate programs and associate
 
01:48:40.109 --> 01:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
degree in
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
nursing one in five of our nursing
 
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
students already has a bachelor's degree
 
01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
in some other field but at some point in
 
01:48:49.950 --> 01:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
life they realize that they're they were
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
meant to become a nurse and they do and
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
so part of this the the demographics of
 
01:48:59.350 --> 01:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
that K through 12 population is always
 
01:49:02.109 --> 01:49:02.119 align:start position:0%
going to be important for all of us but
 
01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
increasingly we've got to figure out how
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
we make ourselves accessible make our
 
01:49:09.149 --> 01:49:09.159 align:start position:0%
programs accessible to this broad
 
01:49:12.589 --> 01:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
cross-section of Learners from K
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
through as long as you want to work uh
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to participate
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
fully a a couple of of additional
 
01:49:25.470 --> 01:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
thoughts about
 
01:49:28.350 --> 01:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
that for the community college system if
 
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
you'll turn to the packet on slide two
 
01:49:37.229 --> 01:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
map what you're going to see is that we
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
are throughout the state and again when
 
01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:45.350 align:start position:0%
are throughout the state and again when
you're

01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
serving working adults in particular
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
people with family and Community
 
01:49:52.830 --> 01:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities it has to be local now
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that it can't be virtual
 
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
too about 30% of our instruction is
 
01:49:59.589 --> 01:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
occurring online that that's the reality
 
01:50:02.189 --> 01:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
and that asynchronous on learning at
 
01:50:05.070 --> 01:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
your pace or I should say on on your
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
schedule but within a semester a term
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
that just works better for a lot of
 
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
adults but we still recognize The
 
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
Importance of Being physically present
 
01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
embedded in regions connected to
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
communities to understand what the needs
 
01:50:22.189 --> 01:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
are and to make those opportunities
 
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
accessible for that
 
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
population you'll see that in addition
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
to the map which shows the distribution
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
of our campuses and our instructional
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
locations that we also describe three
 
01:50:36.589 --> 01:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
different ways in which we serve our
 
01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
students and traditional undergraduate
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
programs degrees and certificates
 
01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
primarily on our campuses but not
 
01:50:47.229 --> 01:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
exclusively again 30% occurring online
 
01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
but this would be very familiar the
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
analog to what you would find in a
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
college or university anywhere
 
01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
but increasingly our work has found its
 
01:50:59.229 --> 01:50:59.239 align:start position:0%
way into serving high school students
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
and again three different ways of doing
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
that in their high schools something we
 
01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
used to refer to as running start online
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
and then also on our campuses depending
 
01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:11.560 align:start position:0%
on what mode what opportunity works best
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
for students last year of the 24,000
 
01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
plus students we served 10,000 of them
 
01:51:19.750 --> 01:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
were high school students and
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
collectively they earned 54,000
 
01:51:26.589 --> 01:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
credits at our tuition rate tuition and
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
fees $215 of credit for tuition $25 for
 
01:51:33.390 --> 01:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
the enrollment fee $24 of credit that's
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
almost $13 million and they did that
 
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
virtually without cost to themselves
 
01:51:42.270 --> 01:51:42.280 align:start position:0%
because the legislature invested $2.5
 
01:51:45.629 --> 01:51:45.639 align:start position:0%
million to allow us to support early
 
01:51:48.510 --> 01:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
college that return on investment is
 
01:51:51.229 --> 01:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
significant and increasingly referring
 
01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
to the pathways that
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
Chancellor preventure mentioned if we
 
01:51:57.589 --> 01:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
can help more students not just take
 
01:52:00.109 --> 01:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
courses but take sets of courses that
 
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
comprise the foundation of Pathways we
 
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
can increase the likelihood of students
 
01:52:08.069 --> 01:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
finding their way to college part of our
 
01:52:10.229 --> 01:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
reason for wanting to grow this program
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
continue to grow this program the
 
01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
original intent of early college was in
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
fact different than it's played out
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
nowadays most of the students who
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
participate in early college programs
 
01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
are students who know they're going to
 
01:52:25.390 --> 01:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
college and their parents know they're
 
01:52:26.669 --> 01:52:26.679 align:start position:0%
going to college and this is just a
 
01:52:29.470 --> 01:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
financially Savvy way to save on cost if
 
01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
you've completed a semester a year of
 
01:52:34.109 --> 01:52:34.119 align:start position:0%
college without having to pay tuition
 
01:52:36.589 --> 01:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
you're you're ahead of the game don't
 
01:52:38.510 --> 01:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
take out loans that year in fact you're
 
01:52:40.589 --> 01:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
a year closer to the labor
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
market but the original intent of early
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
college was actually supposed to be for
 
01:52:47.550 --> 01:52:47.560 align:start position:0%
students who didn't know that college
 
01:52:50.189 --> 01:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
was a possibility to give them a chance
 
01:52:52.069 --> 01:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
to test themselves and come to the
 
01:52:54.109 --> 01:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
realiz ation that they were capable of
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
doing this and for us early college
 
01:53:01.030 --> 01:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
postsecondary opportunity isn't just
 
01:53:03.709 --> 01:53:03.719 align:start position:0%
traditional programs for us it's
 
01:53:06.149 --> 01:53:06.159 align:start position:0%
automotive and it's welding it's any
 
01:53:08.589 --> 01:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
number of the trades for which having an
 
01:53:10.669 --> 01:53:10.679 align:start position:0%
associate degree or certificate is still
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
a critical part of of a career path for
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
those students it might might be
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
somewhat surprising for you to find that
 
01:53:20.589 --> 01:53:20.599 align:start position:0%
although students who enroll at CTE
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
centers comprise about 12% of the
 
01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
state's High School population they're
 
01:53:27.149 --> 01:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
about 30% of the credit activity in our
 
01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:29.679 align:start position:0%
early college program these are students
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
who are recognizing that this aligns
 
01:53:34.030 --> 01:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
well with their career interest their
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
personal interest and it also gives them
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
a foundation for whatever they choose to
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
do with that education
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
next so in addition to our traditional
 
01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
undergraduate programs Early College a
 
01:53:48.629 --> 01:53:48.639 align:start position:0%
growing part of our work and then the
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
third part of our our portfolio if you
 
01:53:55.069 --> 01:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
will work Force programs over the last
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
several years question earlier about the
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
effects of federal government uh and
 
01:54:02.069 --> 01:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
what what changes might bring we have
 
01:54:04.109 --> 01:54:04.119 align:start position:0%
benefited significantly from investments

New Hampshire throughout the state we
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
have four regions again tied to local
 
01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
communities to help us understand what
 
01:54:18.990 --> 01:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
the needs and opportunities are at any
 
01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
given time we're supporting about 300
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
students in appren
 
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
ships and and an apprenticeship you know
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
we used to think of those in the
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
conventional trades electricians
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
plumbers and that's still certainly
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
important although actually outside of
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
our scope of practice but we have folks
 
01:54:37.709 --> 01:54:37.719 align:start position:0%
who have been working with Employers in
 
01:54:40.270 --> 01:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
the state in Fairly innovative ways
 
01:54:42.069 --> 01:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships for teaching
 
01:54:45.069 --> 01:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship for directors for child
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
care centers most recently we have an
 
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship application from of US

the Frontline needs of the state's
 
01:54:57.709 --> 01:54:57.719 align:start position:0%
mental health challenges so
 
01:54:59.629 --> 01:54:59.639 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship as a way of learning
 
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
particularly again whether young or
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
older the ability to earn while you're
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
learning not to put your earning on the
 
01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
Shelf while you're while you're
 
01:55:09.149 --> 01:55:09.159 align:start position:0%
incurring debt or expense for it but
 
01:55:10.709 --> 01:55:10.719 align:start position:0%
actually to be able to earn while you're
 
01:55:13.589 --> 01:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
learning just a different way of serving
 
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
students that's just one of the flavors
 
01:55:18.910 --> 01:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
of Workforce programs we also do
 
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
business we have business training
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
centers on each of our campuses
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
developing programs for licensed nursing
 
01:55:27.870 --> 01:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
assistance medical assistance any number
 
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
of of entrylevel roles and opportunities
 
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
or advanced level opportunities to
 
01:55:36.589 --> 01:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
strengthen Workforce again complimentary
 
01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
not just to the needs of employers in
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
the interest of students but
 
01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
complimentary to the way that their
 
01:55:43.550 --> 01:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
lives unfold with responsibilities for
 
01:55:46.830 --> 01:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
for families a and employers and so
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
forth so our efforts are increasingly
 
01:55:52.270 --> 01:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
trying to serve this wide spectrum of
 
01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:53.560 align:start position:0%
students from high school through
 
01:55:56.030 --> 01:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
lifelong learning while connected to the
 
01:55:58.589 --> 01:55:58.599 align:start position:0%
workforce trying to deliver programs
 
01:56:01.109 --> 01:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
that that respond to the the changing
 
01:56:02.830 --> 01:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
needs that that are created by The
 
01:56:04.510 --> 01:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
Innovation that Chancellor preventure
 
01:56:07.229 --> 01:56:07.239 align:start position:0%
described with New Hampshire's employers
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
and others so let let me pause for a
 
01:56:13.229 --> 01:56:13.239 align:start position:0%
second and see if anything I've said has
 
01:56:15.950 --> 01:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
prompted question or need for
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
clarification uh yeah I have one
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
question that the $2.5 million you spoke
 
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
of that's hitting the student probably
 
01:56:25.149 --> 01:56:25.159 align:start position:0%
would go to college
 
01:56:28.510 --> 01:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
anyways if we up the Annie to let's say
 
01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
three would we T be touching more of the
 
01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
student you're really aiming at we we we
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
think that o over the last several Bia
 
01:56:38.709 --> 01:56:38.719 align:start position:0%
the legislature has increased support
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
for this from roughly a million to a
 
01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
million and a half most recently in the
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
current bium to 2 and a half million
 
01:56:47.629 --> 01:56:47.639 align:start position:0%
we're asking for three in the next bium
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
we think that we're continuing to
 
01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrate progress and as I said
 
01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
earlier the fact that said 30% of our
 
01:56:55.390 --> 01:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
credit activity in early college is
 
01:56:58.069 --> 01:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
found among students in CTE centers
 
01:56:59.629 --> 01:56:59.639 align:start position:0%
suggest to me that we're reaching an
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
audience that in the past in fact we
 
01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:03.159 align:start position:0%
know over the last few years that that
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
doubled nothing else right now yes repr
 
01:57:13.310 --> 01:57:13.320 align:start position:0%
spillsbury uh newcomer question you're
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
you're color coding your different
 
01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
locations on this map in a nutshell
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
what's the distinctions well each of
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
those colors associate with a specific
 
01:57:24.910 --> 01:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
College I I should have I should have
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
addressed this we are
 
01:57:30.589 --> 01:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
currently seven individually accredited
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
institutions the the shared colors for
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
instance with White Mountains primary
 
01:57:38.310 --> 01:57:38.320 align:start position:0%
location in Berlin uh an academic center
 
01:57:41.189 --> 01:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
in Littleton uh River Valley Primary
 
01:57:43.709 --> 01:57:43.719 align:start position:0%
location in Claremont but uh
 
01:57:45.790 --> 01:57:45.800 align:start position:0%
instructional locations in both Lebanon
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
and Keen in fact the Keen location is
 
01:57:52.350 --> 01:57:52.360 align:start position:0%
hosted at Keen State College um I I will
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
note also that Ro uh Great Bay which has
 
01:57:57.950 --> 01:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
primary location at peas and a uh
 
01:58:00.430 --> 01:58:00.440 align:start position:0%
instructional location at Rochester that
 
01:58:02.270 --> 01:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
location at Rochester is a least
 
01:58:04.750 --> 01:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
facility and we expect to relinquish
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
that this year the property has been
 
01:58:08.910 --> 01:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
purchased uh I I believe it's going to
 
01:58:11.870 --> 01:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
be repurposed as a a casino uh we're in
 
01:58:14.350 --> 01:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
the process of relocating our welding
 
01:58:18.629 --> 01:58:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:18.639 --> 01:58:20.270 align:start position:0%
 
Portsmith

01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
Portsmith
 
01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman it's great to
 
01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
see you again I I wonder if you could
 
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
speak um to us again about the the
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
corrections and the the emphasis you're
 
01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
putting on the pathways from nhti moving
 
01:58:35.310 --> 01:58:35.320 align:start position:0%
towards or from these Tech schools
 
01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
moving towards the college system and
 
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
how you've corrected those things the
 
01:58:40.910 --> 01:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
other thing is um a question personal
 
01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
that I never got to ask is there a do
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
you have that same kind of connection
 
01:58:47.830 --> 01:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
between crtc and conquered and coming
 
01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
into the tech thank you we we do the
 
01:58:55.069 --> 01:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
crtc conquered is one of the largest uh
 
01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
participants in early college with us so
 
01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
a handful that that really outperform if
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
you will uh to your question a as chanc
 
01:59:06.990 --> 01:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
perent remark we are now up to about a
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
100 House Bill 1530 from two sessions
 
01:59:12.069 --> 01:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
ago called for the University system to
 
01:59:13.589 --> 01:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
work with the community college system
 
01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
to identify and develop at least 30
 
01:59:17.910 --> 01:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
Pathways for students to progress from
 
01:59:19.109 --> 01:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
the community college system the
 
01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
university system we're now approaching
 
01:59:25.470 --> 01:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
orh past 100 of those Pathways this has
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
become much more seamless for students
 
01:59:30.109 --> 01:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
the ability to know at any one of our
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
campuses that if you take this set of
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
courses that this is exactly how they
 
01:59:37.350 --> 01:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
will map no loss of credit in the
 
01:59:39.790 --> 01:59:39.800 align:start position:0%
transfer process no need to repeat
 
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
courses no delay the opportunity for a
 
01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:46.719 align:start position:0%
student and a family to recognize that
 
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
this is a more affordable pathway as
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
with our early college the the the best
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
way to manage debt is to avoid it and to
 
01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
the extent that we can find these coste
 
01:59:59.390 --> 01:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
effective strategies and make them
 
02:00:01.430 --> 02:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
highly visible and accessible to
 
02:00:03.990 --> 02:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
students throughout the state is one of
 
02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
the most constructive steps we can take
 
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
to help our students and this state have
 
02:00:10.589 --> 02:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
the workforce that it will need for the
 
02:00:10.599 --> 02:00:11.669 align:start position:0%
the workforce that it will need for the
21st

02:00:11.669 --> 02:00:11.679 align:start position:0%
21st
 
02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
century thank you
 
02:00:19.629 --> 02:00:19.639 align:start position:0%
sir yes representative fellows um the
 
02:00:21.470 --> 02:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education has been
 
02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:22.510 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education has been
using

02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
using
 
02:00:25.030 --> 02:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
individual student IDs for almost 20
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
years now and so there's almost 20 years
 
02:00:32.830 --> 02:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
of data in a database somewhere that can
 
02:00:37.149 --> 02:00:37.159 align:start position:0%
tell us um the kids that were in high
 
02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
school and and how many of those went on
 
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
to the university system or went on to
 
02:00:45.470 --> 02:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
the community college system because you
 
02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
track those IDs also is my understanding
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
has there been any utilization of that
 
02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:52.510 align:start position:0%
has there been any utilization of that
data

02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:00:55.149 --> 02:00:55.159 align:start position:0%
to tell inform you about you know what
 
02:00:55.159 --> 02:00:56.750 align:start position:0%
to tell inform you about you know what
what's

02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
what's
 
02:00:59.470 --> 02:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
working I I can't speak for what
 
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
department of education has done with
 
02:01:04.109 --> 02:01:04.119 align:start position:0%
the data we have a relationship with the
 
02:01:05.830 --> 02:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
national student Clearing House it
 
02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
allows us to know when a student applies
 
02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
to us but doesn't enroll where did they
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
end up or when a student has been with
 
02:01:14.589 --> 02:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
us and leaves did they in fact transfer
 
02:01:16.350 --> 02:01:16.360 align:start position:0%
to another institution were they
 
02:01:19.470 --> 02:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
successful there so we we make use of
 
02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
that data often to understand the
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
trajectory of our students academic
 
02:01:27.229 --> 02:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
lives one of the slides you have here is
 
02:01:32.550 --> 02:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
budget management and where is the state
 
02:01:35.189 --> 02:01:35.199 align:start position:0%
funding to what degree is the state
 
02:01:37.310 --> 02:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
funding the community college system
 
02:01:39.709 --> 02:01:39.719 align:start position:0%
more than half of our operating
 
02:01:43.069 --> 02:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
budget we are incredibly reliant on the
 
02:01:45.629 --> 02:01:45.639 align:start position:0%
Investments that the state makes in our
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
work can you be a little bit more
 
02:01:49.950 --> 02:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
specific about that you know I I I've
 
02:01:52.990 --> 02:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
heard from some that we as as much as
 
02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
90% no no unequivocally not the total
 
02:01:59.870 --> 02:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
operating budget in the most recent
 
02:02:02.990 --> 02:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
years is above $120 million House Bill
 
02:02:05.069 --> 02:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
one in the current banum provides us
 
02:02:08.350 --> 02:02:08.360 align:start position:0%
with about $63 million additionally in
 
02:02:10.510 --> 02:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 between the two years of
 
02:02:13.149 --> 02:02:13.159 align:start position:0%
the bani a total of about $10 million
 
02:02:15.270 --> 02:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
but uh student tuition and fees
 
02:02:17.709 --> 02:02:17.719 align:start position:0%
accounting for about 45 million and then
 
02:02:20.189 --> 02:02:20.199 align:start position:0%
Grant activity another 8 or 10 million
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
depending on how rapidly we're we're
 
02:02:24.390 --> 02:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
drawing down the
 
02:02:26.430 --> 02:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
grants thank
 
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
you yes represent Burton thank
 
02:02:31.709 --> 02:02:31.719 align:start position:0%
you two
 
02:02:34.910 --> 02:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
points one one has been mentioned yet
 
02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:36.870 align:start position:0%
points one one has been mentioned yet
excuse

02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
excuse
 
02:02:39.870 --> 02:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
me record on up migration of college
 
02:02:42.870 --> 02:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
graduates in country Vermont is first
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
about over
 
02:02:49.629 --> 02:02:49.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:53.229 --> 02:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
went oh turn the mic around that helps
 
02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me over half of the students who
 
02:02:57.709 --> 02:02:57.719 align:start position:0%
go to higher red in New Hampshire leave
 
02:02:57.719 --> 02:02:58.669 align:start position:0%
go to higher red in New Hampshire leave
the

02:02:58.669 --> 02:02:58.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:03:02.830 --> 02:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
state my point is that the programs you
 
02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
have that get students employed while
 
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
they're in school is is a counteract to
 
02:03:11.109 --> 02:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
that if if they get a job in New
 
02:03:13.629 --> 02:03:13.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they may well more be more apt
 
02:03:16.189 --> 02:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
to stay here and and that's one of the
 
02:03:18.910 --> 02:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
side benefits I think of of what you're
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
doing the the second thing I just want
 
02:03:22.830 --> 02:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
to mention was having been a Community
 
02:03:25.830 --> 02:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
College president was that people will
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
complain sometimes about admin costs
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
growing but when you have 100 Pathways
 
02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
you need advising you need lots of it
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
and it can't just be done online it has
 
02:03:40.750 --> 02:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
to be personto person so I I I when we
 
02:03:43.069 --> 02:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
get into budgets I'm sure I will see the
 
02:03:45.149 --> 02:03:45.159 align:start position:0%
support that's necessary to support
 
02:03:47.830 --> 02:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
those those wines and it but it is
 
02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
necessary because that's what makes them
 
02:03:54.030 --> 02:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
successful am I correcting that you you
 
02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
are correct I I I will say one of the
 
02:03:58.830 --> 02:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
things and I it's taken me some time to
 
02:04:02.910 --> 02:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
get used to this my early on my career I
 
02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
was at Penn State at a time when Penn
 
02:04:07.149 --> 02:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
State was 70,000 students and you're
 
02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
used to large classes and you're used to
 
02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:11.390 align:start position:0%
used to large classes and you're used to
large

02:04:11.390 --> 02:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
large
 
02:04:14.589 --> 02:04:14.599 align:start position:0%
numbers our work in some cases just
 
02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't lend itself to that and it's for
 
02:04:20.030 --> 02:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
a number of reasons when you're serving
 
02:04:22.189 --> 02:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
the North Country to have a dozen
 
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
students participating in EMT and
 
02:04:27.069 --> 02:04:27.079 align:start position:0%
Paramedic program that's a large number
 
02:04:28.830 --> 02:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
of students when you're preparing a half
 
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
a dozen CDL drivers for plow trucks for
 
02:04:34.830 --> 02:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
the winter season that's a good class
 
02:04:37.149 --> 02:04:37.159 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be dozens or hundreds
 
02:04:38.950 --> 02:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's also the case that a lot of the
 
02:04:40.990 --> 02:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
programs that we deliver and you'll know
 
02:04:42.589 --> 02:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
this from your own experience as a
 
02:04:44.149 --> 02:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
community college
 
02:04:46.830 --> 02:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
President one of the areas that
 
02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
community colleges are essential for
 
02:04:51.870 --> 02:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
across this country is Healthcare
 
02:04:54.510 --> 02:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
related programs and the accreditation
 
02:04:56.669 --> 02:04:56.679 align:start position:0%
standard a nursing program the clinical
 
02:04:59.870 --> 02:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
ratio of 8 to1 or dental hygiene 5:1
 
02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
radiologic programs again the close
 
02:05:05.109 --> 02:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
supervision that's required for high
 
02:05:08.709 --> 02:05:08.719 align:start position:0%
quality program outcomes just expensive
 
02:05:10.830 --> 02:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
to deliver and can only be done in small
 
02:05:13.310 --> 02:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
groups so there's a lot about our work
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
that doesn't lend itself to the kinds of
 
02:05:17.589 --> 02:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
of large round numbers that that tend to
 
02:05:19.589 --> 02:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
get people excited and also that tend to
 
02:05:23.629 --> 02:05:23.639 align:start position:0%
allow for efficiency it it it's it's
 
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
peacework in some ways it's individual
 
02:05:28.910 --> 02:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
students small groups but it's
 
02:05:31.629 --> 02:05:31.639 align:start position:0%
impactful I I can as as the interim
 
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
president at Eastern main Community
 
02:05:36.069 --> 02:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
College I can tell you about that Main's
 
02:05:38.750 --> 02:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
ratio is 8 to1 nursing and that's
 
02:05:40.830 --> 02:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
expensive I think New Hampshire is 10
 
02:05:43.709 --> 02:05:43.719 align:start position:0%
to1 8 to1 you're 8 to1 too y that what
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
that means is you have to have one
 
02:05:47.390 --> 02:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
full-time faculty for every eight
 
02:05:50.030 --> 02:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
students and when you do a cost analysis
 
02:05:52.709 --> 02:05:52.719 align:start position:0%
of any college that's always the most
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
expensive it's not technology it is it
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
is Healthcare and it's and that's for a
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
reason uh because that's how you get the
 
02:06:02.830 --> 02:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
the clinical supervision to all the rest
 
02:06:04.629 --> 02:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
of it with those programs but but but
 
02:06:06.990 --> 02:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
some who know me and who have had to
 
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
suffer through my speaking in the past
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
will will know that when we turn to
 
02:06:13.549 --> 02:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
nursing for six years in a row New
 
02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has the highest firsttime
 
02:06:18.830 --> 02:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
enlex pass rate in the country that says
 
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
something about the way the states
 
02:06:22.189 --> 02:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities are preparing
 
02:06:24.270 --> 02:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
nurses and it makes a difference in the
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
health care and the quality of life for
 
02:06:27.669 --> 02:06:27.679 align:start position:0%
residents throughout the state Eastern
 
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
main had
 
02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
100% okay let's get back to some other
 
02:06:33.189 --> 02:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
the issues right I'm I'm interested in
 
02:06:35.149 --> 02:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
hearing you're working with the
 
02:06:38.069 --> 02:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
university system and in terms of the
 
02:06:39.950 --> 02:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
transferability of credit and the
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
pathways to technology used to
 
02:06:46.229 --> 02:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
facilitate this where are we in terms of
 
02:06:48.430 --> 02:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
there's been holes there where are we
 
02:06:52.030 --> 02:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
with the the same data packages between
 
02:06:55.149 --> 02:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
the two systems well if if you're
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
talking about the the Computing
 
02:06:59.270 --> 02:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
environments we're we're in two
 
02:07:02.350 --> 02:07:02.360 align:start position:0%
different uh networks and moving further
 
02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
apart right now Ju Just because the
 
02:07:06.109 --> 02:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
university has made a preemptive
 
02:07:09.790 --> 02:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
decision to move to a new uh Erp system
 
02:07:11.430 --> 02:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
and the community college system is not
 
02:07:13.589 --> 02:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
yet ready to to make that change that
 
02:07:14.990 --> 02:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
Mark I don't want to just because we're
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
in short time the Erp program is what
 
02:07:20.069 --> 02:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm alluding to and we know that the
 
02:07:22.350 --> 02:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
community college system is going to
 
02:07:24.790 --> 02:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
have to have the the funding to get to
 
02:07:27.390 --> 02:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
the level of being able to communicate
 
02:07:30.189 --> 02:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
on the same wavelength we we've put
 
02:07:33.790 --> 02:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
together an RFP to do an an assessment
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
of what it would take for us to
 
02:07:38.709 --> 02:07:38.719 align:start position:0%
transition to a different platform I'm
 
02:07:40.629 --> 02:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
not sure that we're ready to do that and
 
02:07:42.830 --> 02:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
depending on the information we receive
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
I defer to chance of preventure for the
 
02:07:47.149 --> 02:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
cost information associated with the
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
University Systems but more more
 
02:07:51.629 --> 02:07:51.639 align:start position:0%
importantly that's a four or five year
 
02:07:54.189 --> 02:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
process so there's no quick solution to
 
02:07:56.189 --> 02:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
to any of
 
02:07:59.910 --> 02:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
that thank you do you have
 
02:08:03.229 --> 02:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:06.030 --> 02:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
this in in the interest of time I I'll
 
02:08:09.390 --> 02:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
be efficient to say that that the the
 
02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
question that was raised earlier that
 
02:08:13.750 --> 02:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
there's limits to what we can do with
 
02:08:16.149 --> 02:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
efficiencies but we look for them and
 
02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
over the course of the last decade we've
 
02:08:22.830 --> 02:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
reduced our Str our U work by about
 
02:08:26.350 --> 02:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
30% we've begun to do more with
 
02:08:28.510 --> 02:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
Workforce programs those short-term
 
02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
programs we are trying to figure out how
 
02:08:33.229 --> 02:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
we can better serve students in the
 
02:08:35.189 --> 02:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
state in what I think is a changing
 
02:08:38.750 --> 02:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
environment we are currently working on
 
02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
an analysis of how we're structured as I
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier seven separately
 
02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
accredited institutions we don't want to
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
give up our connection to the
 
02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:49.119 align:start position:0%
communities that we serve but we are
 
02:08:50.669 --> 02:08:50.679 align:start position:0%
looking at whether there are different
 
02:08:52.229 --> 02:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
strategies for how we structure
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
ourselves administratively to prioritize
 
02:08:57.629 --> 02:08:57.639 align:start position:0%
how we serve communities how we serve
 
02:09:00.830 --> 02:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
the state uh in in more efficient ways
 
02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
again predicate on the idea that we're
 
02:09:05.189 --> 02:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
really in a growth industry even if it's
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
not always apparent we've got to figure
 
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
out how to reorganize ourselves to meet
 
02:09:11.669 --> 02:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
what I think will be an increasingly
 
02:09:14.350 --> 02:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
larger but different type of demand for
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education in the future
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
where are you on the path to single s uh
 
02:09:21.790 --> 02:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
accreditation we expect with within the
 
02:09:24.669 --> 02:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
month to have a report outlining a set
 
02:09:26.510 --> 02:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
of options that our board and other
 
02:09:28.549 --> 02:09:28.559 align:start position:0%
stakeholders including the legislature
 
02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
can can review and evaluate I I don't
 
02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
think this is a decision that we want to
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
rush but we also recognize that
 
02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
beginning the conversation allows us to
 
02:09:41.549 --> 02:09:41.559 align:start position:0%
move move forward in in some meaningful
 
02:09:43.109 --> 02:09:43.119 align:start position:0%
way and we we hope over the next few
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
months to have more to
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
share you'll be reporting to the the
 
02:09:50.709 --> 02:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
committee on that the highed we we will
 
02:09:51.990 --> 02:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
be doing that
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:09:58.669 --> 02:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
you so much for being here to uh help us
 
02:10:01.629 --> 02:10:01.639 align:start position:0%
do our work better um you were talking
 
02:10:04.109 --> 02:10:04.119 align:start position:0%
about reducing personnal costs and all
 
02:10:07.470 --> 02:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
you know and I was looking at your um
 
02:10:10.669 --> 02:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
jobs postings and I noticed that you are
 
02:10:13.950 --> 02:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
seeking a massive amount of ajun
 
02:10:15.549 --> 02:10:15.559 align:start position:0%
professors I'm assuming those are
 
02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:17.119 align:start position:0%
part-time instructors that are only
 
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
called up as needed and it's basically
 
02:10:21.390 --> 02:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
the equivalent of a contract position
 
02:10:23.669 --> 02:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
not a full-time correct just double
 
02:10:25.149 --> 02:10:25.159 align:start position:0%
checking my assumption I don't want to
 
02:10:27.549 --> 02:10:27.559 align:start position:0%
assume stuff and get it wrong so we we
 
02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
have a balance of full-time faculty and
 
02:10:31.629 --> 02:10:31.639 align:start position:0%
adjunct faculty that gives us
 
02:10:34.750 --> 02:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility allows us to engage uh
 
02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
Talent where we need it but allows us to
 
02:10:41.069 --> 02:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
also manage the expenses associated with
 
02:10:43.069 --> 02:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
delivering I've work in that environment
 
02:10:45.629 --> 02:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
for about 10 years I fully support
 
02:10:46.830 --> 02:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
everything you said in terms of
 
02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
flexibility and the ability to you know
 
02:10:52.229 --> 02:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
just use what's needed and not otherwise
 
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
waste res so thank you thank you sir the
 
02:10:56.549 --> 02:10:56.559 align:start position:0%
the only thing I would add then in the
 
02:10:58.270 --> 02:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
interest of time although willing to
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
handle questions slides 11 and 12 uh in
 
02:11:03.790 --> 02:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
your packet before the photographs
 
02:11:06.069 --> 02:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
simply a list of Partnerships employers
 
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
that we work with throughout the
 
02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
state this is critical to our ability to
 
02:11:14.109 --> 02:11:14.119 align:start position:0%
serve students and serve New Hampshire
 
02:11:17.950 --> 02:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
is to have Partners who help us
 
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
understand what their needs are so that
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
we can help our students with education
 
02:11:24.270 --> 02:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
that aligns with the opportunities that
 
02:11:30.390 --> 02:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.270 --> 02:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
list one of our goals is to um help you
 
02:11:36.109 --> 02:11:36.119 align:start position:0%
all stay informed about the community
 
02:11:37.549 --> 02:11:37.559 align:start position:0%
college system and what we're doing in
 
02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
each region and so we have a couple ways
 
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
of of doing that you should all be
 
02:11:44.350 --> 02:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
receiving a newsletter from us um an
 
02:11:46.510 --> 02:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
email electronic newsletter every two or
 
02:11:48.310 --> 02:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
three weeks we send it out and it goes
 
02:11:49.950 --> 02:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
to your legislative emails so I hope
 
02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
you'll be on the uh on on the lookout
 
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
for that it talks about new program
 
02:11:55.109 --> 02:11:55.119 align:start position:0%
developments and Partnerships that we
 
02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
have with various employers and Civic
 
02:11:59.910 --> 02:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state we also have
 
02:12:01.390 --> 02:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
in the box on the table which I will
 
02:12:04.310 --> 02:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
leave out our hot off the press's annual
 
02:12:06.870 --> 02:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
report that I'm happy to share with you
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
and with it is um this document which is
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
a a listing of all of our associate
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
degree and certificate programs across
 
02:12:16.149 --> 02:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
the state and where they're offered so
 
02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's this is a great resource for high
 
02:12:19.390 --> 02:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
schools guides counselors really like
 
02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
this to help work with their students
 
02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
and help them pursue their particular
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
interests but we'd like you all to have
 
02:12:25.390 --> 02:12:25.400 align:start position:0%

um oh well I mean we're we're talking
 
02:13:33.229 --> 02:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
about maybe having some of the division
 
02:13:36.270 --> 02:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
2 Dems come in from time to time when
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about something yeah
 
02:13:44.350 --> 02:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:48.430 --> 02:13:48.440 align:start position:0%

mean I don't know um you know if they
 
02:13:52.350 --> 02:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
