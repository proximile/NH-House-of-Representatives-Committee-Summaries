okay

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 align:start position:0%
all right unless there's any uh
 
00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 align:start position:0%
objection we'll just go in uh Alpha
 
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
numerical order and start with House
 
00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 align:start position:0%
Bill 1312 and representative leckis you
 
00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
have a motion I do I
 
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
recommend for further legislation for
 
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
house bill 1312.
 
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.950 align:start position:0%
house bill 1312.
okay

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.690 align:start position:0%
okay
second

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.730 align:start position:0%
second
seconds

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
you should speak to your motion sure
 
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 align:start position:0%
um this actually turned out to be uh
 
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
very productive this is a reminder the
 
00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 align:start position:0%
issue was there was a small business
 
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's required to put in a
 
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 align:start position:0%
a big grease uh trap when they were
 
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
required to
 
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 align:start position:0%
when they change their name a little bit
 
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
and you know some thought that the
 
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
department was a reasonable to balance
 
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
excited to sell a few other things
 
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.609 align:start position:0%
excited to sell a few other things
um

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 align:start position:0%
so we had a meeting with
 
00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
representatives from the Department
 
00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
Services as well as the ability board
 
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
turned out that there were some
 
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 align:start position:0%
conflicts between the rules that the two
 
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
promulgate in this area
 
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
and there was also
 
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.330 align:start position:0%
and there was also
um

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 align:start position:0%
you know I some on the committee and
 
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
others thought that the rules were
 
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
too rigid and that the waiver process
 
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
which did exist was unclear people
 
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
didn't know about it and it's actually
 
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 align:start position:0%
too restrictive so
 
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
the folks from those two boards agreed
 
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
to go off and meet
 
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
and uh come up with some kind of uh
 
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
proposal which they did
 
00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 align:start position:0%
and they came up with that or maybe
 
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
referred to any reason like
 
00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 align:start position:0%
it'll be probably be a good idea all
 
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
right sorry about that
 
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
your subcommittee meeting got top
 
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
billing on the house for 11 page
 
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
your subcommittee meeting
 
00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
you got top going on on the web pages as
 
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
some of the activities I see
 
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
so they came back with a proposal had
 
00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
some comments on them they revised The
 
00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.150 align:start position:0%
some comments on them they revised The
Proposal

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
Proposal
 
00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 align:start position:0%
and the the end result was something
 
00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
that everybody involved seemed to be
 
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
happy with so what they did is they uh
 
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 align:start position:0%
they've committed to doing some
 
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
rulemaking to
 
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.309 align:start position:0%
rulemaking to
um

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
to get the rules in line so they're not
 
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
in conflict and also to loosen up the
 
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
requirements um
 
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
somewhat to take into account you know
 
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses than normal
 
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to drop DS is going to
 
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
drop the requirement the minimum size
 
00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
for grease trap from a thousand to 500
 
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
gallons which will make it match the
 
00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 align:start position:0%
international plumbing code
 
00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
modify the criteria for small food
 
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
service establishments that would be
 
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
permitted to use internal uh
 
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
you know they're called hydromechanical
 
00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 align:start position:0%
grease traps without having to bury some
 
00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
great big tank
 
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
and they would allow that by rule under
 
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
some circumstances and they also loosen
 
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
and clarify the rules on getting a
 
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.250 align:start position:0%
and clarify the rules on getting a
waiver

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
and so this isn't going to require
 
00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 align:start position:0%
legislation they have committed doing
 
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
rule making they also committed to
 
00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 align:start position:0%
providing additional training to the
 
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
inspectors on not only the changes but
 
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
also you know the process for
 
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 align:start position:0%
waivers which I guess have been kind of
 
00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
ad hoc and they're gonna
 
00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 align:start position:0%
formalize the process a little bit more
 
00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
so um you know it was unanimous on the
 
00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 align:start position:0%
committee that that sounded like a good
 
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
solution and also uh representative
 
00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
Aaron who is the Prime sponsor of the
 
00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 align:start position:0%
bill and uh
 
00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 align:start position:0%
you know thought this was fine and also
 
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
the business in her District that
 
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
prompted this whole thing you know
 
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron showed the planned
 
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
agreement to them and and they also were
 
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
happy with it so
 
00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need to do anything
 
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
further other than you know we can keep
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
an eye and make sure the rulemaking
 
00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 align:start position:0%
actually occurs in the training as they
 
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
committed to okay representative Mr
 
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.570 align:start position:0%
committed to okay representative Mr
Speaker

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'll just add that
 
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
it was somewhat gratifying to hear that
 
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
Des took this as sort of a learning
 
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
moment and is has there was a great deal
 
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
of cooperation in forming the solution
 
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
that they arrived at and I'm hopeful
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
that that may solve some problems that
 
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 align:start position:0%
could have come to us in the future
 
00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
without us having to be involved
 
00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 align:start position:0%
uh anyone else
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
I'd like to mention that I went to the
 
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
final meeting of the working group
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
and you're absolutely right Des was
 
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
kind of shocked at how convoluted the
 
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
process was
 
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
and so was Des
 
00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 align:start position:0%
and the building code review board
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
agreed to modify
 
00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 align:start position:0%
the plumbing code so that the
 
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
requirements of hooking up to a sewer
 
00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 align:start position:0%
system were consistent with Des Sewer
 
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
Septic requirements
 
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.370 align:start position:0%
Septic requirements
which

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
because Des had specified one of the
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
allowable options and said you must use
 
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
this option if you're connecting to a
 
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
septic tank and therefore the plumbing
 
00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
code needed to be modified to say that
 
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
if you are connecting to a septic tank
 
00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
so it
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
was very useful and I appreciate
 
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron from bringing us
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
this bill but it doesn't need
 
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
and legislation at this point
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
representative sitec so you believe
 
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
these people
 
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
I I believe I made a comment at the end
 
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
saying we need to keep an eye on it to
 
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
make sure the rulemaking and training
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
occurred and there's nothing to prevent
 
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
future legislation if they don't they
 
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
they seem to be pretty serious and
 
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
committed to it so I don't see any
 
00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:07.259 align:start position:0%
reason not to believe them but you know
 
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
you don't trust but verify kind of thing
 
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
if you always keep an eye on them yes
 
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
January they haven't started into
 
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
rulemaking we might want to uh nag them
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
a bit
 
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.070 align:start position:0%
a bit
and

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
what else represents high tech again the
 
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
clerk notes that representative Schmidt
 
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
is not here the Rockies will tumble
 
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
Gibraltar will crumble and it almost
 
00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:33.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.340 align:start position:0%

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
with Mr representative Lucas but
 
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
I'm a little disappointed that none of
 
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
this makes whole the people who were the
 
00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:50.699 align:start position:0%
victims of this
 
00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:52.979 align:start position:0%

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
dollars on this nonsense yes well we
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.010 align:start position:0%
can't make retroactive laws

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%

the size of their building
 
00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
we might not have
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
gotten the chance to get involved in
 
00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:23.749 align:start position:0%
gotten the chance to get involved in
this

00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair I make a motion
 
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
that the subcommittee would like to us
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
to make a motion that we can it be
 
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
recommended for continued legislation
 
00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:56.519 align:start position:0%
but for the legislation
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
okay would you wish to speak to your
 
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
during the course of the hearing there
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
was a resistance from the doctors who
 
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
were part of a lobbying group that
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
actually hadn't been registered with the
 
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.290 align:start position:0%
actually hadn't been registered with the
state

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
um they have since registered with the
 
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
state and enjoying the subcommittee
 
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.130 align:start position:0%
state and enjoying the subcommittee
hearing

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
the information that I had gathered from
 
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
other medical spas were that the medical
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
director position
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
was one where a doctor was actually
 
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
being paid for the use of his name in
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
that profession
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
and they're available their availability
 
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
was not
 
00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:45.889 align:start position:0%
was not
um

00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:45.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
was it wasn't clarified
 
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
so they're used their their
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
representation as the medical director
 
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
of that of a facility and in many cases
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
they are medical directors at many
 
00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:00.590 align:start position:0%
they are medical directors at many
facilities

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
um so that they're available it wasn't
 
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.670 align:start position:0%
um so that they're available it wasn't
clarified

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
um perhaps a different word instead of
 
00:11:11.569 --> 00:11:11.579 align:start position:0%
Medical Spa a better word might be
 
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
medical cosmetology
 
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
so these are recommendations that we
 
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
would take with us should we continue
 
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
um legislation on this bill
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
and the Board of Nursing was present at
 
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
the hearing any support these changes
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
and support the bill
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
who was
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry was the Board of Nursing okay
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative goalie I I have a
 
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
question actually yes in what form what
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
form of legislation are you recommending
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
a bill what do you mean uh the same
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
similar where
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
um oplc would have the authority to
 
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
inspect and any
 
00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
um concerns but they would refer to
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
represent goalie do you should speak to
 
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
your second
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I too agree that
 
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
um this should be further looked into as
 
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
the medical spas
 
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.730 align:start position:0%
the medical spas
um

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
are using drugs such as Botox and such
 
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.590 align:start position:0%
are using drugs such as Botox and such
not

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
um in their procedures and this would
 
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
give oplc the ability to go in and
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
further inspect and
 
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh the requirement that uh checking in
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure that those are being used
 
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
yes representative I would like to also
 
00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:44.899 align:start position:0%
say that not only with this the new
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation give oplc authority
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
to inspect and refer to the appropriate
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
board but there would be
 
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
um the availability of the medical
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
director will be clarified to something
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
like 15 minutes so if they if they were
 
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
to be called they had to be they'd had
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
to respond with a specific time
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
and we would also look at changing the
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
terminology in the bill from Medical Spa
 
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
representative blackis thank you I have
 
00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:20.459 align:start position:0%
a question that is what form would you
 
00:13:20.459 --> 00:13:22.430 align:start position:0%
a question that is what form would you
anticipate

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.269 align:start position:0%
anticipate
um

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
sort of the the licensing taker you're
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
talking about doing a facility license
 
00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:29.339 align:start position:0%
for it yes similar to what we're going
 
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do with the massage
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
therapist exactly good follow-up
 
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.670 align:start position:0%
therapist exactly good follow-up
follow-up

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.110 align:start position:0%
follow-up
um

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that even like a
 
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
doctor's office doesn't have a facility
 
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.509 align:start position:0%
doctor's office doesn't have a facility
license

00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
and assuming I'm correct in that you
 
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
know what's different about this where
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
you'd require a facility license for a
 
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
place that you know probably isn't doing
 
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
things any more hazardous probably less
 
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
I disagree
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
these are medical facilities that are
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
not doctors offices they perform
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
services such as not only Botox
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
injections but filler injections and
 
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.150 align:start position:0%
injections but filler injections and
um

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
well there's something else that they do
 
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
that I can't really recall but that are
 
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:13.790 align:start position:0%
that I can't really recall but that are
um

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:15.949 --> 00:14:15.959 align:start position:0%
putting a foreign substance under your
 
00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:16.850 align:start position:0%
putting a foreign substance under your
skin

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
skin
 
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
and that requires
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
you know certain expertise and if
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
something should go wrong
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
because oftentimes a nurse is making
 
00:14:29.449 --> 00:14:29.459 align:start position:0%
these is conducting these procedures if
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
something can go wrong and there's no
 
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
one to consult with her then the patient
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.279 --> 00:14:40.310 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
um okay I mean I can agree certainly
 
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
that can be hazardous
 
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:44.750 align:start position:0%
that can be hazardous
um

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:47.339 align:start position:0%
but I mean there's some things of
 
00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:48.899 align:start position:0%
similar Hazard I think that occur at
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
doctors offices I mean
 
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
I I maybe could go along with you know
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
requiring access to a doctor more
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
quickly but I question whether it's a
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
step of uh facility license is actually
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
necessary so thank you okay
 
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
representative Allegro and then Marsh
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
you know I just want to make 100 sure
 
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
that I understand each of the service
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
providers is licensed under their own
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
board is that correct
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh uh yes thank you
 
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
madam chair I think it's become evident
 
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire that we
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
have a distinct lack of transparency in
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
medical disciplinary procedures
 
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
um and this is uh pervasive amongst
 
00:15:32.689 --> 00:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
medical practitioners
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
um that such that things don't
 
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
necessarily become known to the public
 
00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
that would be coming under the public in
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
other states the question before us is
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
whether more legislation is needed I
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
think what representative grotta is
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
saying is that the public deserves to
 
00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
have more transparency because
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
complications have been known to happen
 
00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
in some of these elective cosmetic
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
procedures and whether that legislation
 
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
takes the form of more transparency at
 
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine or whether that
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
legislation takes the form of Licensing
 
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
of these facilities is an open question
 
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
not a question before us today but I
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
firmly believe that more legislation is
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
needed because I believe we do need more
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
transparency to deal with the the and we
 
00:16:20.569 --> 00:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
need more transparency from the Board of
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Tech the oh
 
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm going along with this
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh I would point out I
 
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
think the difference between this and
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
the doctor's office is a doctor has a
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
considerably higher level of training
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
and experience than say a nurse that's
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
doing the procedure so maybe on with
 
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
that toe in the door I'll go along with
 
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.590 align:start position:0%
that toe in the door I'll go along with
this

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:53.889 --> 00:16:53.899 align:start position:0%
representative Allegra
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
although representative I would like to
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
add that
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
in general and broadly certainly The
 
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
Physician has a wider scope of training
 
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
and more training but not necessarily in
 
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
a very narrow
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
procedure that's being performed
 
00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
so uh you know a physician may have more
 
00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
experience than an electrician as well
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.250 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
Rhodes

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
Rhodes
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman uh
 
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
representative I if I may have a
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
question and
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
I I don't mean for this to sound
 
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
defensive but I'm a little bit concerned
 
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
about the terminology of medical
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
cosmetology or medical cosmetologists
 
00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:45.419 align:start position:0%
whatever you said
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
um is I think everybody is very clear
 
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
that a cosmetologist is not in any way
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
shape or form
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
allowed to diagnose any kind of medical
 
00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
condition so in in the word of
 
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
transparency is using that terminology
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
or creating this term
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
to make it be more appropriate to what
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
someone's looking for is that actually
 
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
going to confuse the public more into
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
thinking that
 
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
this person is a doctor when they
 
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
certainly are not is it's unless I'm
 
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
understanding away I might be
 
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding what you're saying so
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm not I'm really not being
 
00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:21.299 align:start position:0%
defensive I'm really confused on what
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
you mean by that and I understand and I
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that was a
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
suggestion I'm not saying that's what's
 
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
going to happen but they thought that
 
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
the word Medical Spa might be might not
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
indicate the kinds of procedures that
 
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
are being done there so medical
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
cosmetology was a suggestion only
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
it's not something that would
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative scitec representative
 
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
Allegro I'm voting to see uh continue
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
with this not to I'm not voting on the
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative fellows
 
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
um I'd just like to say that like I'm a
 
00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
little concerned about what you call it
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
too so I'm you know if we if there's a
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
bill comes up then some research can be
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
done to figure out what do other states
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
call this and I think that that would
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
help but I think another important
 
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.830 align:start position:0%
help but I think another important
reason

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
um to have them licensed is that we need
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
to identify specifically what they can
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
we're in
 
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
when we first started the subcommittee
 
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.220 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
the consensus at the first meeting was
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
that this sort of operation should be
 
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
if it's licensed at all it should be
 
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
licensed by HHS as the same way they
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
license other medical facilities because
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
it is a medical facility and it should
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
not be licensed in the same way that
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
barber shops are
 
00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:06.020 align:start position:0%
and that's something that
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
the whatever kind of Bill you put in is
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
going to have conflicting requirements
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
and I I believe that if it's a medical
 
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
if it's a problem that people are
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
working outside of their scope of
 
00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
practice or outside of their knowledge
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
and experience
 
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
that's not an issue for oplc that's a
 
00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
problem for
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine or the Board of
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
Nursing or whomever
 
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.890 align:start position:0%
Nursing or whomever
um

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
and so I I don't like the idea that you
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
send oplc in to you know check people
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
have licenses because
 
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
as I said it's it's a medical problem
 
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
not a
 
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
a licensing issue I haven't heard in any
 
00:20:59.150 --> 00:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
of the testimony we had that that there
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
were unlicensed individuals doing things
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
it was more a matter that licensed
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
individuals were working outside of
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
their scope of practice
 
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
so I I would be very very hesitant to
 
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
vote on on whatever legislation came
 
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.350 align:start position:0%
vote on on whatever legislation came
through

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
