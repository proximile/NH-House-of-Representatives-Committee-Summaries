00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
motion representative
 
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman I just
 
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to let people know I did have a a
 
00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 align:start position:0%
couple questions during the hearings um
 
00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 align:start position:0%
and it was really because I had um
 
00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
investigated um different a couple
 
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
different states and how they approached
 
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 align:start position:0%
this um but I feel satisfied um I went
 
00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 align:start position:0%
back and researched a few more States
 
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
and um you know although there's you
 
00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 align:start position:0%
know different wording and um the
 
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
structure is pretty much the same and it
 
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
seems like it works fine for the other
 
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
states um and there are me and it's true
 
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
that many many other states actually
 
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
have this in statute already so just
 
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.750 align:start position:0%
have this in statute already so just
wanted

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
to you and I neglected to say to our
 
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
seat filler some committee chairs want
 
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 align:start position:0%

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 align:start position:0%

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 align:start position:0%

missed this public hearing I was at the
 
00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
Senate at the time um so I was hoping
 
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
that someone could give me a uh a
 
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
discussion about uh when this is
 
00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
utilized like is it when maybe someone
 
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
goes into military service that sort of
 
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
thing uh and they I've seen that before
 
00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
with two reservists Mom and Dad end up
 
00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
having to sign the children over to
 
00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.630 align:start position:0%
having to sign the children over to
other

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
you would okay would
 
00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
anybody have uh
 
00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
Recollections from your notes oh let's
 
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
say representative Greg I bet would
 
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I was like yeah I
 
00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
recall so the it's such that if let's
 
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
say you are going to go out of town
 
00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 align:start position:0%
Let's do an easy one you're going to go
 
00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 align:start position:0%
on vacation I'm going to go on vacation
 
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to leave my dad with my
 
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
children well it's it's pretty customary
 
00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
for a lot of people to get something
 
00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 align:start position:0%
notorized saying that if you know my
 
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
child needs medical care or whatever
 
00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 align:start position:0%
else that my dad is now in my stad going
 
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
to be able to direct care for my minor
 
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
children the however without a statute
 
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
like this particular statute on the
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
books it's not legally binding so we can
 
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
say that but in other states where I've
 
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
seen it before it's because there is an
 
00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 align:start position:0%
RSA on the books that allows that to
 
00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
happen we don't have anything legally
 
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
allowing that happen so a doctor could
 
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 align:start position:0%
deny Care Now is it likely we don't know
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
but we don't want to take that chance if
 
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
there's something uh crucial so that's
 
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
what it does um does that explain it uh
 
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
thank you um follow up followup uh I
 
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
thought I saw in here somewhere about
 
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
two notorized
 
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
signatures is did I or no two witnesses
 
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
um is I don't know what your question is
 
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
sorry line 10 um oh about whether or not
 
00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
you have two signatures
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so you need a notary
 
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
or doesn't
 
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.510 align:start position:0%
or doesn't
say

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know if I
 
00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
permission permission to representative
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
representative Vick um so that I think
 
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
is in reference to um and we had um
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
talked about that in in hearing um Most
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
states um will create a a form you know
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
it's like a form that you follow and um
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
other states that I have researched do
 
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
have a form and they do have an area for
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
signatures that are not notorized
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
um and that's where that would um come
 
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
into play um
 
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
follow up on follow up follow up um
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
seems like two notaries seems like a lot
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.150 align:start position:0%
to me
and

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:48.749 align:start position:0%
 
or

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
online maybe M Raymond would help me I
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
mean representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
chairman So currently there is no form
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so we have to do the
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
bill first and then the form in
 
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts you could find it um like
 
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
if you Google it it'll come up and I
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
think it's in their um judiciary's
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
website but but I'm not sure um but it's
 
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
something that like you could download
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
this also opens the door to not needing
 
00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:14.759 align:start position:0%
a form you could write your own you
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
could type up your own letter as a
 
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
parent as you can now um but it gives it
 
00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:23.879 align:start position:0%
the statutory weight so in testimony um
 
00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:26.759 align:start position:0%
someone came and talked about how um
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
they had sent their kids to I think 10
 
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
to the grandparents for this for some
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
time in the summer which was their
 
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
normal process and one of her kids got
 
00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:38.919 align:start position:0%
an ear infection um and the doctor in
 
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
Tennessee didn't want to treat them
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
without something notorized inwriting
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
that cited a statute that gave Grandma
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
permission to seek it um in that
 
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
particular person's case she had a
 
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
military form because the military has
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
these for people um but New Hampshire
 
00:07:58.189 --> 00:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
didn't have anything or any statutory
 
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
thing so her feeling was something like
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
this would allow for other families to
 
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
have that same advantage that the
 
00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
military families have very good um so I
 
00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:10.039 align:start position:0%
would hope that it would be someplace
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
like the traditional brand or I don't
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
know who else would would have these on
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%

me and was roundly chewed out I am the
 
00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
one that does it I'm the one that gets
 
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
yelled at uh this does not mean that you
 
00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
can't sign up to speak on your
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%

attention here
 
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:start position:0%

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
need to come from me and I've talked
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
with most of you but I want to make sure
 
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
this is 100% correct before I send it in
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
uh we have five bills coming up if you
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
look at the house calendar we've got 359
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
which raises the marriage age to 18
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
there is you will see a floor Amendment
 
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
1455 on page
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
39 um the floor Amendment moved by to be
 
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
moved by representative yella and
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative D Simon that
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
adds a simple statement saying unless
 
00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
the person is
 
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
emancipated I'm just giving you what the
 
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
batting order is speaking against that
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment uh not for the committee
 
00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
but as people will be representative
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
Petrino and giving the pi if one is
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
needed representative LC now
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
when that comes when that that we know
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
that there's people speaking against it
 
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0%
if you can sign up to speak against that
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment if you
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
wish once the amendment is decided one
 
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
way or the other representative LC will
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
speak about the bill either OTP or
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
otpa and representative patrino will
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
give the pi this is at their
 
00:23:59.710 --> 00:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
request um honestly
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know how many people are
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
emancipated in this state in the course
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
of the year and wish to get married at
 
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
age 17 I think I could probably count
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
the number on one
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
finger but but still okay any questions
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
on the batting order on
 
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
359 who's going to speak for it if it is
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
amended you said it would be le and
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
patrino they will be speaking for it no
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
matter how I get to assign that and they
 
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:28.990 align:start position:0%
matter how I get to assign that and they
volun

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
volun
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
appeared if the amendment is accepted
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
they will speak for the bill that is
 
00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
correct that is what you told me correct
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
okay good and since she's been the
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
guiding force on this and she wishes to
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
do that you got
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
it all right um let's go down to
 
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
463 I'm not quite sure what 463
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
is but it came out of here uh
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
unanimously an amendment I liked failed
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
so it is simply
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
OTP and representative D Simon you had
 
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
told me you would speak on
 
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
463 unless it's quickly voice
 
00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
voted that's for court appointed counsel
 
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.909 align:start position:0%
voted that's for court appointed counsel
for

00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:18.919 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
children yep yep if that is 463 it is
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
okay you said you'd do that and
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative Greg would do the pi on
 
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.110 align:start position:0%
representative Greg would do the pi on
that

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.350 align:start position:0%
that
now

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.750 align:start position:0%
 
498

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
um there may be a
 
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
motion to
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
recommit that
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
bill back to this
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
committee I told the speaker that what
 
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
we had discussed last week is our
 
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
business is done
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
today and I did not sends anyone wanting
 
00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
to come back to a recommitted bill that
 
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
we like as it is is a perfect no but we
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
like it that's why we we voted
 
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
it if there is a motion to recommit and
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
I spoke to the chair yesterday and he
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
said there
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
is and if it comes back to us here it is
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
I told him I might have to get about
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
eight or nine seat fillers who probably
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
don't want come in for a 30- second
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
motion I will make
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
OTP and of course they'll vote with me
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
or and the vice chair because that's
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
what seat fillers do so the speaker is
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
attempting to quell any attempt for this
 
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
to be recommitted but I just want you to
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
know if it is a motion I will I have a
 
00:26:56.389 --> 00:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
blistering floor speech ready that
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
probably should be toned down but I'm
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
not not feeling it right now and I will
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
do the
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
pi there may be instead a floor
 
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039 align:start position:0%
Amendment which I have not seen and I
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
will also speak against that and do the
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
pi uh there's some stuff floating around
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
that you know after a while guys we've
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
talked it to death you haven't gotten
 
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
your way several times I'll be damned if
 
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to get your way now I will
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
fight you yes thank you Mr chairman um I
 
00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
thought the reason for um Rec committal
 
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
the last time was to add the definition
 
00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
of fictive kin which we did in the
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
amendment correct
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
yes fictive kin it can be argued it has
 
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
been argued that the word kin in statute
 
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
was broadened to include non-blood
 
00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
relatives but that would be an inference
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
that that is the definition of fictive
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
many states have found it important
 
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
since the word fictive is used not to
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
infer it from something else but to
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
Define it specifically so yeah we found
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
one of the objections one of the reasons
 
00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:16.039 align:start position:0%
some people wanted this recommitted is
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
for a definition effective and I will be
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
continuing to fight for that definition
 
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
which came from a multi-state group of
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
people and when you do a side by side of
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
that multi-state group of people people
 
00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
with what other states have it's almost
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
the same yes representative Greg thank
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um so the definition of
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
kin was actually expanded in 2022 did we
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
know that yeah so that's already in
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
statute right I I think I said that oh
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
okay great sorry my brain say fictive it
 
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
said kin is expanded to include
 
00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.789 align:start position:0%
said kin is expanded to include
non-blood

00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
non-blood
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
relatives okay
 
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
so you know you coming from a legal
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
family you and me they're trying to get
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
if the word included there what does it
 
00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:04.519 align:start position:0%
mean can we infer it from that probably
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
reasonably but it does not H to State it
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
the the word kin means cousin and it's
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
like Irish uh Scotch uh should this be
 
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
challenged I'm going to suggest that you
 
00:29:18.669 --> 00:29:18.679 align:start position:0%
come as an expert witness well my my
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
mother's mother was Kinsman got it and
 
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
that now once the bill is ready to vote
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
on the bill representative Raymond said
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
you would make the
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
speech yes sir thank you and I'll do the
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
pi I think uh so that is taking care of
 
00:29:36.519 --> 00:29:38.909 align:start position:0%
pi I think uh so that is taking care of
that

00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
573 uh about confidentiality of Youth
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
health care and so on that came out of
 
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
here unanimous and it says so in the
 
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
calendar uh representative long I asked
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
to uh give the speech if necessary it'll
 
00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
probably be voice voted but you never
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
know we've got to be ready
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
representative D Simon was asked to give
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:14.389 align:start position:0%
 
more

00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
417 and remember we had a committee
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment and the committee Amendment
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
took out a very what some of us felt was
 
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:26.200 align:start position:0%
a very broad statement like if the the
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
kiddo isn't happy
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
and with something that the kiddo want
 
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
and isn't getting isn't happy with the
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
parents etc etc and uh the reason I
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
wanted that taken out is there's a good
 
00:30:42.269 --> 00:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
chunk of my caucus that probably would
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
not support this bill if that statement
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
were in there according to the emails
 
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
I'm getting notwithstanding what other
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
laws may or may not say they want this
 
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
out and that's what the amendment did
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
also it took out a blunt statement that
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
said if you're found not to be
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
cooperative with the investigators we
 
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
could hold this against you that's my
 
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
paraphrase um that's a little in your
 
00:31:10.029 --> 00:31:10.039 align:start position:0%
face that's a little threatening now we
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
know that's going to be true anyway if
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
somebody's investigated and they're
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
playing games you know that's going to
 
00:31:21.149 --> 00:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
be held it's just felt that um it's too
 
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
much so we took that out in the
 
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
amendment and then finally we added the
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
definition of fictive k I'm going to add
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
this to every bill I can until it gets
 
00:31:29.039 --> 00:31:29.909 align:start position:0%
this to every bill I can until it gets
into

00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
law um so that was the amendment and I
 
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
am happy if it's challenged to defend
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
the committee Amendment with the speech
 
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
and representative D
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
Simone said she would do the pi on
 
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
that um and then the bill becomes OTP
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
with that Amendment and um I'm doing
 
00:31:54.029 --> 00:31:54.039 align:start position:0%
something I don't usually do I'm doing
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
much of the speaking uh I will give the
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
speech and representative patr you said
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
that you would do the
 
00:32:04.629 --> 00:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
pi thank you so that takes care of
 
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
Thursday um be on your
 
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
toes now the next item on our business
 
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
before we get back to the Senate bill is
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
on uh retained
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
bills and as you know we've got two of
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
them uh the speaker's office says that
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
we may start work on that in
 
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
June you or whoever signs up to be on
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
the retained Bill sub committee work
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
group may start now I think some of you
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
already have you can find information
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
you can have a chitchat with uh the
 
00:32:52.509 --> 00:32:52.519 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor you can talk in ones and
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
twos and threes you just cannot go over
 
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
50% of who the work group is going to be
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
when we officially start perhaps in June
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
that will be at the call of the
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee chair and then that has to
 
00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
be noticed in the calendar that there
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
will be a public work group on you have
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
to name the date the place just like one
 
00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:22.039 align:start position:0%
of these meetings so we've got two in
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
hand and what I would like to do is I
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
would like to see who would like to be
 
00:33:28.919 --> 00:33:30.430 align:start position:0%
would like to see who would like to be
on

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.310 align:start position:0%
on
which

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
1269 and I believe that
 
00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
1269 was the question of uh
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
restraints and that was by I can never
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
get his name right I think there's a
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
letter missing
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it's it's another one of your
 
00:34:04.269 --> 00:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
Irish friends representative bigford
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%

00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%

you uh let's just give it a few more
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
minutes I'm not going to make an
 
00:34:53.069 --> 00:34:53.079 align:start position:0%
official appointment I want to see what
 
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
the vice chair wishes to do and then we
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 15 House Bill 1590 relative
 
00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
to training regarding child abuse and
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
neglect for licensed Physicians advanced
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
practice nurses and physician
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
assistants um you know 1269 was
 
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored by all Republicans which is
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
why I put a Democrat to chair it uh 1590
 
00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:24.599 align:start position:0%
was sponsored by all Democrats which why
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
is why I'm going to name me to chair it
 
00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.790 align:start position:0%
is why I'm going to name me to chair it
um

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
um I can ask my staff about this because
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
I have Physicians and nurse
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
practitioners there who would like to be
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
on training regarding child abuse and
 
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
neglect it's not going to take long one
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
or two sessions at most 1590 this is
 
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.109 align:start position:0%
or two sessions at most 1590 this is
retain

00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
Bill s before I okay I won't finish
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
writing your name thank you Mr chairman
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
um my concern because I would like to
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
serve on on either one of them but but
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
this one probably a little bit more so
 
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
is I'm not going to be around until

yeah we really could get into some
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
trouble here asking ourselves
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
why anyone else on this
 
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:12.920 align:start position:0%

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
1269 chair is Petrino uh Nelson D Simon
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
LC Raymond and long 1590 the chairman is
 
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
the chair with Representatives sidel
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
you're doing hazardous Duty on something
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
else at the moment
 
00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
so okay good now do we have the amended
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh she sending up to
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
HCA HCS and uh when they get it they
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
don't okay so those are the only those
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
are the only housekeeping items that I
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
have and unless anybody else has no
 
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.829 align:start position:0%
have and unless anybody else has no
business

00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
if there's no other business we are in
 
00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:31.720 align:start position:0%
recess but don't go far because if the
 
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
amendment is up on the fourth
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
floor if the amendment is running down
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
the corridor towards the fourth floor we
 
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
should have it in hand fairly
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
soon so uh if you you want to get up and
 
00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
stretch and so do do we not have to do
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
anything at all with this amendment no
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
that amendment is now dead it has not
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
been presented
 
00:39:59.550 --> 00:39:59.560 align:start position:0%

01:22:37.149 --> 01:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
H and this is now the
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
amendment and we have to discuss put
 
01:22:42.669 --> 01:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
into play the amendment before we put
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes sir can I ask a question
 
01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman how did you change the pitch
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
of your voice so
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
quickly it's I first heard Mr chairman
 
01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
and I said yes and then somebody about
 
01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
an OCT of higher responded so with the
 
01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
first person who's uh in a sort of a a
 
01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:52.280 align:start position:0%
Meto baso range
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
yes I think here's your chance you I I
 
01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
think my my neighbor here was helping to
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
get your attention for me um did you
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
wave I did was I looking in that
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
direction you were when you want to try
 
01:24:07.629 --> 01:24:07.639 align:start position:0%
it again sure yes representative Raymond
 
01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have a question
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
about the amendment um and how it fits
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
in with the bill um and I just want to
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that I'm understanding we're
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
keeping the bulk of
 
01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
459 and then this amendment tacks on to
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
the end after where it says
 
01:24:29.709 --> 01:24:29.719 align:start position:0%
report I sure hope so okay because it
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
amends the
 
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
title and then if you look at line eight
 
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
amend the bill by replacing section
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
five with the following so everything
 
01:24:43.629 --> 01:24:43.639 align:start position:0%
that is in one two 3 4 is still good to
 
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
go so does to follow up does that mean
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
that the committee is no longer going to
 
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
do the section five which is the report
 
01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
oh probably should be section
 
01:25:09.390 --> 01:25:09.400 align:start position:0%
six it would seem so oh no because this
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
says it starts with Section six so one
 
01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:14.119 align:start position:0%
would think that it replaces section six
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
and Beyond yeah they rumed it yeah the
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
numbers change in a new right thank you
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
so if it starts the new one starts with
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
five so
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
Bud says replacing section five that
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
means section five goes which is what
 
01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
she pointed
 
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
out and then it's starting at sections
 
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
new section six so we've lost five and
 
01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:54.390 align:start position:0%
new section six so we've lost five and
gained

01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
gained
 
01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.669 align:start position:0%
gained
a

01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:25:55.679 --> 01:26:01.709 align:start position:0%
a
six

01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:01.719 --> 01:26:03.350 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:26:05.629 --> 01:26:05.639 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah you're amending the bill not
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.390 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
off it just should just
 
01:26:34.679 --> 01:26:37.910 align:start position:0%
off it just should just
that

01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
second it should be an amend yes that's
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
my question do we lose the report
 
01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
section of the original bill or do we
 
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
keep the report
 
01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
section I don't know personally I think
 
01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
at this time uh we do need to move
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
forward and not do all of this all over
 
01:26:56.910 --> 01:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
again again uh however I do know from my
 
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
time at DHHS oversight committee which
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
is now four years uh some often if if
 
01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
there is not anywhere a a requirement
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
that you send the following a report you
 
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
can ask for it and usually get it so I
 
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
mean I'm not sweating that as much as I
 
01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:17.270 align:start position:0%
mean I'm not sweating that as much as I
like

01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:19.709 --> 01:27:19.719 align:start position:0%
reports anything else are we ready we
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
ready to have somebody put this
