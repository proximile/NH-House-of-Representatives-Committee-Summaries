00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.730 align:start position:0%
Michael Kane for an explanation of a
proposal

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
on changing some of our rules
 
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:01.860 align:start position:0%
sure thank you good morning Mr chair
 
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
my name is Michael Kane the legislative
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
budget assistant for the State of New
 
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire item number one on your agenda
 
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
is a request to amend the fiscal
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
communities rules and procedures and
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
this is what directs our office to what
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
we can and cannot include on your agenda
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
so the request before you there are two
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
options and the request is basically for
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
the months of May and June to allow
 
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
items that utilize funding from the
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
American Rescue plan or the bipartisan
 
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919 align:start position:0%
infrastructure law or any other
 
00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:36.899 align:start position:0%
previously enacted Federal relief bills
 
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
to be authorized through June 30th 2025.
 
00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:42.899 align:start position:0%
that statement is basically saying if I
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
receive an item in Das receives an item
 
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
that goes beyond June 30th 2023 has to
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
be related to these buckets of money and
 
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
then we would allow it on the agenda
 
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
which then the committee would take a
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
vote at that time to either approve or
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
so does everyone understand normally
 
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:05.700 align:start position:0%
we're only dealing with the present
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
biennium however every member of this
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
committee is going to be a vote for or
 
00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
against the budget for the next biennium
 
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
so it isn't isn't as if we have no
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
control going forward of those funds
 
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
because we'll all be in some manner
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
voting for them so although this is an
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
exception to what we do I think that in
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
my mind it's still something we are in
 
00:09:32.449 --> 00:09:32.459 align:start position:0%
some control of it does save a lot of
 
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
paperwork and perhaps layoffs that might
 
00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:37.940 align:start position:0%
otherwise occur should we not approve
 
00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
one of these options for changing in our
 
00:09:41.339 --> 00:09:42.350 align:start position:0%
one of these options for changing in our
rules

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley moves the moves that we
 
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.990 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley moves the moves that we
adopt

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
just to pick one again option two
 
00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
have you looked at the two options
 
00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
is it for option two you're moving
 
00:09:59.339 --> 00:10:00.650 align:start position:0%

aye aye opposed no

the rest of the consent calendar is
 
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
is 23110 Department of Business and
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
economic affairs
 
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
do we have someone here to answer
 
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.829 align:start position:0%
do we have someone here to answer
questions

00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative erf has a question on the
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:25.139 align:start position:0%
and this is also related to 23 122 so it
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
well to discuss them at the same time
 
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:32.220 align:start position:0%
so instead of asking this question twice
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
so what does Equity have to do with
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
broadband and why is that a
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
consideration in
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
accepting these federal funds so under
 
00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:47.459 align:start position:0%
the so what we've been dealing with to
 
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:50.220 align:start position:0%
this point has been uh funding that's
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
provided to the state through arpa and
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
the capital projects fund those were the
 
00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
the items that we had before you last
 
00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
summer and then again last fall
 
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
um these funds are now shifting us over
 
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
to the bipartisan infrastructure lot or
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
bil or iija or whichever acronym you
 
00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:09.889 align:start position:0%
bil or iija or whichever acronym you
choose

00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:09.899 align:start position:0%
choose
 
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
um this is a different part of resources
 
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
included in that law is a require is a a
 
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
funding source to assist
 
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
States in this matter of digital Equity
 
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
so in most cases in our in our industry
 
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be looking at is the
 
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
fact that we're going to be hooking up a
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
lot of rural communities both with the
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
previous funds and with the funds that
 
00:14:38.569 --> 00:14:38.579 align:start position:0%
we have yet to uh to receive and as part
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
of that there is an initiative within
 
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:44.220 align:start position:0%
the federal federal law that would allow
 
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
for assistance for people who are not
 
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
used to dealing with digital uh
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
interactions so an example would be for
 
00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:55.100 align:start position:0%
elderly populations that would be using
 
00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
Telehealth or getting access using a
 
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
laptop or a computer it would be funds
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
that would be allowed used through the
 
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
state to help those individuals access
 
00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:10.019 align:start position:0%
the digital component of the Broadband
 
00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:14.329 align:start position:0%
the digital component of the Broadband
hookups

00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to talk about these
 
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
together now just so I understand what's
 
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
going on this is for half a million the
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
other one's roughly the other one's for
 
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
2 million maybe you just describe the
 
00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
difference between the two but more
 
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
importantly the question I have for
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
based on what you just said was
 
00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
I'll be talking about some of the
 
00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:30.899 align:start position:0%
funding maybe that two million dollars
 
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
being to provide support to the
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
individuals who need this help or we're
 
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
making decisions about who gets the
 
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
Broadband access based on some sort of
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
equity no no nothing to do with the
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
former this is exclusively about helping
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
people access the internet using the fun
 
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
the hookups and the funds that we'll be
 
00:15:51.769 --> 00:15:51.779 align:start position:0%
using to connect those those locations
 
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not
 
00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
um deciding who gets the Broadband it's
 
00:15:59.810 --> 00:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
just it's assisting people once they
 
00:16:02.689 --> 00:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
have it how they use it right so that's
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
the primary purpose of the digital
 
00:16:09.129 --> 00:16:09.139 align:start position:0%
Equity Fund the other item under uh 122
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
that is a requirement to get
 
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
um access to the next tranche of funding
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
under the bil for continued activity in
 
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
driving more Broadband infrastructure in
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
the state so there's a significant
 
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
amount of money that would come as a
 
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
result of us completing that study the
 
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
two million dollar item yeah we it we
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
don't know what the final number will be
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
but we do expect that it would be in
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
excess of 100 million dollars additional
 
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
so if I'm not mistaken and I don't have
 
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
it right in front of me I believe that
 
00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:50.339 align:start position:0%
one also makes reference to broadband
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
equity so both of them I refer in many
 
00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:57.980 align:start position:0%
places to the whole digital Equity
 
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
component under the federal law that the
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
thing to bear in mind is that these two
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
items will result in access to two
 
00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
different pots of money but they are
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
both under that Federal bil uh sort of
 
00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:17.569 align:start position:0%
both under that Federal bil uh sort of
moniker

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:17.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
so does that mean the word Equity is
 
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
just that's in the title the federal law
 
00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
or whatever that's not that's nothing to
 
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
do with what the second pot of money is
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
about what is the second pot of money
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
about the two million dollars what is
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
that actually so the the bead funding
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
under the section uh
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
all right if I had a chart it would be a
 
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:36.980 align:start position:0%
lot more helpful so we have the the
 
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
bipartisan infrastructure law the
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure legislation within that
 
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
is a uh is the Broadband I mean excuse
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
me the bead program within bead program
 
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
there is a digital Equity component and
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
then there is the infrastructure
 
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
expansion component we're talking about
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
both of them here uh the digital Equity
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
we're requesting uh 525 000 to pay a
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
contractor to to to write the plan that
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
will then be submitted to the federal
 
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
government which should unlock funding
 
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
for digital Equity activities that I
 
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
described earlier uh the other uh the
 
00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
other pot of money the two million
 
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
dollars would be for a contractor to
 
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
um to design a plan that we would then
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
again submit to the federal government
 
00:18:24.289 --> 00:18:24.299 align:start position:0%
and upon their approval would unlock
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
another pot of money that would be the
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
100 million dollar item that I refer to
 
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
here and that's for the infrastructure
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
Investments them so elves
 
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
I hope that makes some sense so no that
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
does make sense but now let's stick to
 
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
the two million dollar piece the plan
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
being because the title of it is for
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
Broadband Equity access yeah so I'm just
 
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:47.220 align:start position:0%
wondering now does that plan that you're
 
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
developing need to be related to equity
 
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
in some in some form as far as how the
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
Broadband access is going to be provided
 
00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
as opposed to an approach that gets the
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
biggest bang for the buck
 
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
because you're now you're talking about
 
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
if I understand what you just said now
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the transom money
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
to actually install Broadband I
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
understand your question our
 
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
understanding right now and uh is that
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
the equity component is referring to
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
people having uh access to the internet
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
not access to the Broadband itself we
 
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
will continue on the track that we are
 
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
on currently which is expanding access
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
to unserved and underserved areas of the
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
state with these resources
 
00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:33.059 align:start position:0%
another Forum I went to
 
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
it here they're going down a road and if
 
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
someone has a thousand foot long
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
driveway to get to their house they
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
exclude them
 
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
because they won't want to spend the
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
extra money to to send that much wire
 
00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
might even require another poll so
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
Equity means you don't skip them you're
 
00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
going to give them
 
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
access as well even though they might
 
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
have their their residence further from
 
00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
the road that you're running the wire
 
00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
down so it that's that's what the equity
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
is you got to cover everybody on the
 
00:20:03.169 --> 00:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
road not just the ones that are close by
 
00:20:06.169 --> 00:20:06.179 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding yes that that
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
would be a correct interpretation we are
 
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
making sure that people get that access
 
00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:12.539 align:start position:0%
we're currently in that instance that
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
you describe uh they would basically be
 
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
charged for that thousand feet of their
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
driveway whereas that would not be the
 
00:20:21.049 --> 00:20:21.059 align:start position:0%
case with these resources
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative leishman for a question
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so several months
 
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
ago we were approved dozens and dozens
 
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
of millions of dollars for Broadband
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
expense expansion we had a number of
 
00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
people sitting here encouraging us to
 
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
vote that way has anything happened
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
there as far as if you put contracts out
 
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
as expansion started yes in both cases
 
00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
so uh you'll remember there were two uh
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
the first one a Broadband connect
 
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
program we'll call it round one was
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
awarded to the New Hampshire Electric
 
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
Cooperative they have already begun work
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
they have I think they're in 50
 
00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
different communities they're doing work
 
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:06.900 align:start position:0%
right now they're ramping up this spring
 
00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:09.059 align:start position:0%
to be able to put they tell me 20 miles
 
00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:12.059 align:start position:0%
a week of fiber uh out in the
 
00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
communities The second contract was
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
awarded to Consolidated Communications
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
they are already beginning their work in
 
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
planning for this Summer's construction
 
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
season both of them are under pretty
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
strict time restrictions because these
 
00:21:32.289 --> 00:21:32.299 align:start position:0%
are so they're moving quickly
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
right now what we're seeing what we're
 
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
expecting from both of these contracts
 
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
is to be able to connect 50
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
000 new locations in New Hampshire that
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
are either unserved or underserved and
 
00:21:47.289 --> 00:21:47.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
chairman Senator Rosenwald for a
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman so
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
is this going to be one contractor who
 
00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.770 align:start position:0%
is this going to be one contractor who
gets

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
gets
 
00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
two contracts I'm trying to figure out
 
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
when is like you get the Broadband so
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
then you could watch TV or maybe have
 
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
a digital phone and internet and the
 
00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
other one is teaching people to use the
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
internet well not so much to use the
 
00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:16.820 align:start position:0%
internet but to
 
00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
with the high-speed internet in
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
communities that don't have that
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
capability right now
 
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
um you have people that have not had the
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
experience necessarily of using their
 
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
computer to talk with their doctor or to
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
manage their finances or to do those
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
sorts of functions the federal law
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
included resources to help states meet
 
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.690 align:start position:0%
included resources to help states meet
that

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:43.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements of those
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
individuals so that's what the that one
 
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
the item 110 is for that is the higher
 
00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:54.059 align:start position:0%
we'll put out an RFP for a consultant to
 
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
uh to complete that plan on our behalf
 
00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
which would then be submitted to the
 
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
federal government if it's accepted then
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
we unlock some resource for that
 
00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
particular purpose it's the same process
 
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
um for the second item 122. it's for a
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
third party contractor to write a plan
 
00:23:15.409 --> 00:23:15.419 align:start position:0%
which then you know to meet the federal
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
requirements we would submit that to the
 
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
federal government and then that unlocks
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
an additional resource for the
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
further questions remember we are
 
00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
discussing both items 23 111 and 23 one
 
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
two two
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry 23 110 and 23 122.
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
any further discussion I'll entertain a
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
motion to adopt uh 110 23 110. I'll move
 
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
both items if you want
 
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
all right that'll be fine you uh
 
00:23:52.029 --> 00:23:52.039 align:start position:0%
representative Earth moves both
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative 23 110 and 23122
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
second by uh Senator Bradley further
 
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing Nani ready for the
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
question to accept these two items all
 
00:24:09.529 --> 00:24:09.539 align:start position:0%
in favor say aye opposed no those items
 
00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
are adopted excuse me we're moving to
 
00:24:12.179 --> 00:24:14.810 align:start position:0%
are adopted excuse me we're moving to
23-11

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
23-11
 
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
and we also have questions on that
 
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
good morning Nathan white Chief
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer with the Department of
 
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services good morning
 
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
Trisha Tilley director of Public Health
 
00:24:33.649 --> 00:24:33.659 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
um representative leishman had questions
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
on item number 23-111
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thanks for
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question on your page five it
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
lists the state agencies that are
 
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
receiving grants or Estates or Indian
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
tribes Etc and I was just curious
 
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
looking at the comparison between Maine
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
and Vermont Maine and Vermont are
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
receiving a lot more money than we are
 
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
is that because of Eligibility that more
 
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
people in Maine are eligible versus New
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm assuming that but I just
 
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that is correct
 
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
that mean more children or more low
 
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:18.860 align:start position:0%
income uh proportion of we were probably
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
certainly a greater proportion of low
 
00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.190 align:start position:0%
certainly a greater proportion of low
income

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:28.580 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosamond thank you are we
 
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
reaching every eligible person in New
 
00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:34.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we just have fewer
 
00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:39.299 align:start position:0%
eligible or are there things we could be
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
doing sure so um we are certainly not
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
reaching every eligible person in New
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire let me rephrase that everyone
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
who is eligible for WIC does not
 
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
participate is probably the safest way
 
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
to say that we have been doing extensive
 
00:25:54.649 --> 00:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
Outreach efforts
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
um we believe we've actually seen an
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
uptick after years of declining
 
00:26:00.409 --> 00:26:00.419 align:start position:0%
enrollment we are now seeing an uptick
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
again we think that's in part due to the
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
pandemic it may also be in part right
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
now as SNAP benefits decrease people are
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
coming back to using WIC as well because
 
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
WIC is you know snap is a cash benefit
 
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
WIC is a food package so it's a little
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
bit more complicated or at least
 
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
restrictive than cash benefits
 
00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:22.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
for the questions from the committee
 
00:26:26.769 --> 00:26:26.779 align:start position:0%
move the item
 
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
representative Alicia leishman moves the
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
item Senator Bradley seconds it further
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none you're ready for
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
the question all in favor say aye oppose
 
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
no we've adopted item 2311.
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:58.610 --> 00:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
this is the Department of administrative
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
Services welcome
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Sheri Rockburn I'm the
 
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner for the
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:10.679 --> 00:27:12.590 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
this was a someone had a question on the
 
00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:18.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
again I believe it was because of the
 
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
fact that there seemed to be a big
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
difference even though the last item
 
00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:30.020 align:start position:0%
had a big difference in uh
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
qualification among the New England
 
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
states this this was a different kind of
 
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:43.130 align:start position:0%
states this this was a different kind of
alignment

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
and we wondered why why one one program
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
is affected by the poverty in this one
 
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:54.169 --> 00:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
so I can
 
00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
attachment B yeah New Hampshire this
 
00:28:03.289 --> 00:28:03.299 align:start position:0%
time has about the same amount of money
 
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
as Rhode Island
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
and about half as much less than half as
 
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
much as Maine
 
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.810 align:start position:0%
much as Maine
and

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
obviously a lot more than Vermont
 
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.090 align:start position:0%
obviously a lot more than Vermont
so

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
we're wondering about the
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
the different criteria that they vary
 
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
from state to state we saw in the last
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
one that the other states seem to have
 
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
more poverty
 
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
now that's not the case so what is this
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
based on yeah
 
00:28:33.289 --> 00:28:33.299 align:start position:0%
um the director was unavailable to be
 
00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:35.700 align:start position:0%
here this morning so the questions that
 
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
I thought were coming through the LBA
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
was about the the program itself and the
 
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
Commodities so I brought that
 
00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
information with me
 
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
so I can let me find out a little bit
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
more about that mechanics of the program
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of why our dollars would have
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
changed senator
 
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
Senator D'Alessandro uh thank you yeah I
 
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
did have a question about the
 
00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
Commodities the commodity distribution
 
00:28:59.690 --> 00:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
program and uh what was happening with
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
regard to that I've been involved with
 
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
that for a long period of time
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
so I can speak to that in terms of the
 
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
program itself on the formula I can try
 
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
to get that answered before the end of
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
the meeting to get back to you on that
 
00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of the program itself we
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
receive funding through the federal
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
government for assistance for food
 
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
service we contract with one
 
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:22.140 align:start position:0%
organization it's the community action
 
00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
program of Belknap and Merrimack
 
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
and the funding that we receive is both
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
for administrative costs to run the
 
00:29:30.409 --> 00:29:30.419 align:start position:0%
program and then also sort of the value
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
of the food
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
that organization the warehouse is
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
located in industrial on Industrial
 
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
Drive up in the in the Heights sort of
 
00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
near 106 route 106. the food gets
 
00:29:42.889 --> 00:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
delivered there from the U.S department
 
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture and then it gets
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
distributed to local organizations
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire food banks
 
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:52.100 align:start position:0%
pantries Etc homeless shelters
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 22 last year we received about
 
00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
4.3 million in food value
 
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
this grant or the item in front of you
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
is to accept additional money for the
 
00:30:06.529 --> 00:30:06.539 align:start position:0%
administrative cost of the program and I
 
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
do have a list I sent it through the LBA
 
00:30:09.529 --> 00:30:09.539 align:start position:0%
but can provide it to all of you who
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it is the types of
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
Commodities which really range from
 
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
almonds up through peanut butter through
 
00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:19.980 align:start position:0%
chicken so it really is you know both
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
perishable and non-perishable Goods okay
 
00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Miss Jim
 
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
the other puzzling thing was why did
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
administrative Services get involved
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I I don't know the
 
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
answer of or if anyone at HHS knows that
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
um it goes through our department I
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
don't know the the back story on that
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's been running through our department
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
um since the Inception of the program so
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
I'd have to do a little digging of why
 
00:30:51.889 --> 00:30:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
for the discussion from the committee
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'll entertain a motion to adopt movie
 
00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.230 align:start position:0%
I'll entertain a motion to adopt movie
3137.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
3137.
 
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
motion by Senator D'Alessandro second by
 
00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley to adopt the item
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
seeing none are you ready for the
 
00:31:09.769 --> 00:31:09.779 align:start position:0%
question all in favor say aye aye
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
opposed no the item is adopted
 
00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:15.799 align:start position:0%
next item number
 
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
I have several of that's okay that's
 
00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.409 align:start position:0%
I have several of that's okay that's
fine

00:31:36.409 --> 00:31:36.419 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:31:38.529 --> 00:31:38.539 align:start position:0%
um the first one that I think is easy
 
00:31:45.889 --> 00:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
turned it off and
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
opening it on so good morning I'm Katya
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
Fox I'm the director of the division for
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health and the centers that
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
are so there are three centers as you
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
indicated Manchester received a planning
 
00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:04.860 align:start position:0%
Grant which has actually concluded and
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
then the other two in that have current
 
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
grants are Nashua and West's Central
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
sorry I have to write too many things
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
down here once
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
okay so the next question is it makes
 
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
reference to developing new Medicaid
 
00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:28.740 align:start position:0%
Payment Systems can you tell me what
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
that means yes so as part of this
 
00:32:31.799 --> 00:32:33.590 align:start position:0%
that means yes so as part of this
process

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
um there are certain requirements about
 
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
um how the clinics are set up so they
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
have criteria and I think some of that
 
00:32:45.049 --> 00:32:45.059 align:start position:0%
is included in this request
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
um there is also a requirement that we
 
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
look at how we reimburse the um the
 
00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
centers in this model so that is why
 
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
some of the funding is going to go for
 
00:33:00.289 --> 00:33:00.299 align:start position:0%
our actuary to be able to help us with
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
that but it's on the premise of a
 
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
prospective payment which is the way
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
that we currently fund our federally
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
qualified Health Centers and our
 
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.750 align:start position:0%
qualified Health Centers and our
hospitals

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
and Henry Whitman is here if if there
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
are more Medicaid funding questions
 
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
maybe let's go to him then
 
00:33:24.049 --> 00:33:24.059 align:start position:0%
um so it also talks about improved
 
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
models and infrastructure for data and
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
metrics tracking and quality oversight
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
so I have two questions related to this
 
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
what metrics are being tracked and how
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
will we and the public be able to see
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
the results of that tracking I.E well so
 
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
we will know that you're being
 
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
successful that the program is
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
successful or less successful
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
so again thank you for that question
 
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
this is going to really provide us the
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
outcome data that we've all been
 
00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:54.539 align:start position:0%
searching for we often have that process
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
data and we count how many people served
 
00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.490 align:start position:0%
data and we count how many people served
and

00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
um and ages and demographics and things
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
but this will allow us to look at
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
outcome data to see how successful the
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
the clinics are in their work with
 
00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:11.990 align:start position:0%
the clinics are in their work with
individuals

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
and the second part of that was and how
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
will we the legislature and the public
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
also be able to understand how
 
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
successful they were absolutely we have
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements but beyond that
 
00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
it's really important for us to be
 
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
um sharing that information so that
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
you'll have it we all have it and we've
 
00:34:34.609 --> 00:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
done a lot of work within the department
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
to create dashboards and to create
 
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
accessible data for transparency and for
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
every the public to see how we're doing
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
so that will be part of this process as
 
00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:46.730 align:start position:0%
so that will be part of this process as
well

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:46.740 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
great I hope when we do the budget in
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
the next cycle at the very least we
 
00:34:52.369 --> 00:34:52.379 align:start position:0%
would see that kind of feedback
 
00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
absolutely we all need it thank you
 
00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.220 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald for a question yeah
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
um the prospective payment system that's
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
a higher reimbursement
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
rate isn't it it's sort of a
 
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know I think the community
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
health centers
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
they get a higher level of payment
 
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
do you do you know what the differential
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
is in
 
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
amounts that
 
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
maybe would
 
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
increase funding to these Community
 
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers if we went to the
 
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
perfect perspective payment system yeah
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
I think there are a lot of discussions
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
and a lot of theories of what that would
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
be and what that would look like and how
 
00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
much more it would be I do not have that
 
00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
information because that's the purpose
 
00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:50.099 align:start position:0%
of the planning Grant is to go through
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
that process what we want to make sure
 
00:35:56.569 --> 00:35:56.579 align:start position:0%
is that the providers are paid for the
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
services that they're delivering and
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
that it's high quality care and there's
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
access for individuals so whether that
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
is going to be more we know we have the
 
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
budget that was passed by the house and
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
into the Senate that has significant
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate increases which goes a
 
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
long way toward helping our providers in
 
00:36:20.089 --> 00:36:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
and if Henry wants to stand up behind me
 
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
he's welcome to but
 
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
um he has more experience in in this
 
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
payment methodology than I do
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
um because of the providers we're
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record Henry
 
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
Littman the state's Medicaid director
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
I think we do have to do the Actuarial
 
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
work but the basic gist of the model
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
that's being evaluated is to provide a
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
more stable funding to community health
 
00:36:59.230 --> 00:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
centers so that they can make the
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
Investments and Staffing and what have
 
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
you we currently work under
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
um sort of a two-level system right now
 
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
one where
 
00:37:11.569 --> 00:37:11.579 align:start position:0%
um there are the FIFA Service rates plus
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
under the Managed Care Program the cmhcs
 
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
participate in decapitation contract so
 
00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
it's hard to know whether someone's
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
better off or worse off with respect to
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
their finances until we do a little bit
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
more analytical work here but generally
 
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
I think the the funding sources intended
 
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
to provide a little more certainty in
 
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
terms of streams of funding so that I
 
00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
think they can invest in the services to
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
and certainly it would be part of a a
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
budget that you would get to vote on in
 
00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative erf move the item if
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
representative excuse me representative
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
erf moves 23-138 Senator dalessandro
 
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
seconds further discussion seeing none
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question all in
 
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:07.140 align:start position:0%
favor say aye
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
aye opposed no that item is adopted
 
00:38:17.089 --> 00:38:17.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
the next one I had removed was 23 128
 
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning Mr chairman
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
Josh Elliott director of the division of
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
policy and programs with New Hampshire
 
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.870 align:start position:0%
policy and programs with New Hampshire
Doe

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
Senator representative Earth did you
 
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.730 align:start position:0%
have a question
yes

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
um so I'm only vaguely from the LIHEAP
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
and I know what it is and that's all
 
00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
about and it's been going on for quite
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
some time
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
so my question is not related to the
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
funding for that that's obviously great
 
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned but what is your
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
current Staffing for running this
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
program and why do you need more staff
 
00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
to run a program that's been going for
 
00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:02.940 align:start position:0%
quite some time as I understand it sure
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question so
 
00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
our current Staffing and we have two
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
staff members who currently uh 100 of
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
their time is devoted to this program we
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
are requesting a second staff excuse me
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
a third uh staffer in order to help
 
00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
improve efficiencies in the program
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
again you're seeing uh you know over 80
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars just being handled by
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
two folks
 
00:39:26.089 --> 00:39:26.099 align:start position:0%
um you have the increasing complexity
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
with Federal requirements on this
 
00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:28.970 align:start position:0%
with Federal requirements on this
program

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
um we've had additional duties assigned
 
00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
based on the federal grants including
 
00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
set up a water assistance program as
 
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
part of LIHEAP so we're seeing great uh
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
increasing complexity with complying
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
with Federal requirements for this
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
program that necessitates uh adding a
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
third staffer who again will be able to
 
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
improve efficiencies current staff is
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
pre-stretched then as it is so it'll
 
00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
so if I'm not mistaken this is a
 
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
temporary full-time position does that
 
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
imply that it's this is only temporarily
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
needed or or what's going to happen
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
um we will thank you for the question um
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
so we will evaluate over the course of
 
00:40:11.569 --> 00:40:11.579 align:start position:0%
the the next biennium obviously there'll
 
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
be an item to to re-up this um once the
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
new biennium starts
 
00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:17.339 align:start position:0%
um we'll take a look at this once we
 
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
come in for the now the current budget
 
00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
but the the I should say not the current
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
budget under consideration but the
 
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
subsequent budget after that as to
 
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
whether or not either Federal
 
00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
Regulations have changed there's some
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
other changes with the program
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
um and either will um
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
ah we'll see what we need in terms of
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
Staffing at that point
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
I see you have uh several write-ups on
 
00:40:41.569 --> 00:40:41.579 align:start position:0%
this program in this in this
 
00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
single audit Federal audit so is this
 
00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
person going to possibly help with some
 
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
of those
 
00:40:50.089 --> 00:40:50.099 align:start position:0%
write-ups that have been brought up some
 
00:40:52.609 --> 00:40:52.619 align:start position:0%
of them the second a third time
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
I yes thank you for the question um yes
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
having those extra staff will make sure
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
that you know we're following everything
 
00:40:59.329 --> 00:40:59.339 align:start position:0%
to the T we're making sure we're
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
communicating with our business offices
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're following all
 
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:07.859 align:start position:0%
further discussion from committee
 
00:41:07.859 --> 00:41:12.770 align:start position:0%
further discussion from committee
members

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley move so you adopt the
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
item Senator Rosenwald seconds is there
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
any further discussion seeing none all
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
in favor say aye aye opposed no the item
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.849 --> 00:41:34.859 align:start position:0%
item one one two twenty three one twelve
 
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
is from the Department of Health and
 
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:47.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
representative irf did you have a
 
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:49.550 align:start position:0%
representative irf did you have a
question

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
yeah so why are we specifically
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
concerned with and this is a quote from
 
00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:57.589 align:start position:0%
concerned with and this is a quote from
the

00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
document the mission of ojjdp is to
 
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of minority youth
 
00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
disproportionately serviced in the
 
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
that's been a core mission of ojjdp for
 
00:42:14.329 --> 00:42:14.339 align:start position:0%
as far as I know decades and the reason
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
why it's been a core mission is that
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
nationally there has been great
 
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
disproportionality in terms of minority
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
youth in the juvenile justice system and
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
in the adult correctional system
 
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
so one of the core focuses of ojjdp in a
 
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
requirement of the Federal grant is that
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
states do work to look at the
 
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
disproportionality within their systems
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
and try to do work to help find ways to
 
00:42:35.089 --> 00:42:35.099 align:start position:0%
reduce the disproportionality within
 
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
their systems
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:40.609 --> 00:42:40.619 align:start position:0%
so I'm assuming we're talking about
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:44.150 align:start position:0%
cisie but other things but primarily
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:44.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:47.329 --> 00:42:47.339 align:start position:0%
and well we've always had a lot of
 
00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
recent discussions about
 
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
who should be in there and that sort of
 
00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:51.770 align:start position:0%
who should be in there and that sort of
thing

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
and I've had the impression that the
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
decisions regarding who should be in
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
there have nothing to do with race or
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
ethnicity or anything of that nature so
 
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why
 
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
you know we need to look at this
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
so the juvenile justice system is a lot
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
bigger than just the facility but I do
 
00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
have data that shows here and it's
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
consistent nationally that the minority
 
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
youth are disproportionately part of the
 
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice System whether that's
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
at the arrest decision point at the
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
decision point to file petitions at the
 
00:43:25.609 --> 00:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
decision point to put a young person on
 
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
probation at the decision point to put a
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
young person in placement or at the
 
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
decision point to have a young person be
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
detained or committed
 
00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:32.870 align:start position:0%
detained or committed
um

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
not because explicitly race is a factor
 
00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
in those decisions but those are the
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
outcomes that we see in the data and
 
00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why for again going
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
back I think 20 plus years this has been
 
00:43:47.089 --> 00:43:47.099 align:start position:0%
something that ojjdp has required states
 
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
to consider and try to find ways to
 
00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:50.809 align:start position:0%
to consider and try to find ways to
mitigate

00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
mitigate
 
00:43:50.819 --> 00:43:53.569 align:start position:0%
mitigate
so

00:43:53.569 --> 00:43:53.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
isn't it possible that it's because they
 
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
commit more offenses that put them into
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
that situation I think there's a lot of
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
things that are possible but I think
 
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
there are probably many contributing
 
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
factors to why we see those outcomes and
 
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
I think they're probably
 
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
um you know underlying factors that
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
cause those outcomes as well in terms of
 
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
the types of supports and services that
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
are provided to different communities is
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
related to you know historical you know
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
inequities in the way that folks have
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
been treated over time I think there's
 
00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:25.140 align:start position:0%
lots of things that result in this
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
impact but nevertheless the impact is
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
so that's the case will there be
 
00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
something you produce that we all get a
 
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
hold of to understand if in fact that is
 
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
the case that it's because of race that
 
00:44:41.089 --> 00:44:41.099 align:start position:0%
that people are being inappropriately
 
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
put into the system I want to be very
 
00:44:44.329 --> 00:44:44.339 align:start position:0%
careful I'm not saying that they're
 
00:44:46.609 --> 00:44:46.619 align:start position:0%
being put in because of race in terms of
 
00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
it being an intentional decision that
 
00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
people are doing to put you know to to
 
00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
make these choices what I'm saying is
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
that the outcome in the data which I
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
could produce and have a whole meeting
 
00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
on it if we want shows that this is true
 
00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
in both the child protection and the
 
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice systems
 
00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579 align:start position:0%
so I'm not questioning the data I'm
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
questioning your I'm asking is what's
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
coming out of this an explanation of why
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
we're seeing the data and I'm quite
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
honestly I'm less concerned with
 
00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
historically 20 years ago and we're
 
00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
concerned with currently because it
 
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
seems to me there's an implication here
 
00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
that there's something other than
 
00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
the the people that are there are
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
committed or or found
 
00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
guilty of offenses
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
based on something besides the fact that
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
they did something wrong
 
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
yeah and again right understanding the
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
decision making that individuals make at
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
all these different points at the point
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
of first contact with with law
 
00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
enforcement at the point of arrest at
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
the point of whether or not to file a
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
petition at the point of whether or not
 
00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
to to find that petition true and to
 
00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
have a young person go on probation or
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
be placed or go to sysc all of those
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
decision points there's lots and lots of
 
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
factors that go in there I don't have
 
00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
the ability to to pick apart every
 
00:45:59.210 --> 00:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
decision in every case and tell you why
 
00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
those decisions make why those decisions
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
are made what I can tell you is that the
 
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
outcomes are what the outcomes are and
 
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
the goal of this is to look at trying to
 
00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
find ways to mitigate that now we are
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
actively trying to find ways to mitigate
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
mitigate that right now the Juvenile
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
Justice Assessment program that we spend
 
00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of time talking about on the house
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
side in particular which really has the
 
00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
goal of identifying youth needs early
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
and making sure that youth are connected
 
00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
with resources early before they get
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
pulled deeper into the Juvenile Justice
 
00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
System part of the goal of that is to
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
try to help impact this because we also
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
know that Minority youth are less likely
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
to have access to some of those types of
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
Supportive Services in the first
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
instance so you would be able to
 
00:46:38.089 --> 00:46:38.099 align:start position:0%
hopefully divert some of those folks to
 
00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
get the Supportive Services they need
 
00:46:41.089 --> 00:46:41.099 align:start position:0%
and prevent them from ending up deeper
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
into the Juvenile Justice System
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
let me be more direct will you be
 
00:46:49.609 --> 00:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
providing us a report on what you find
 
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's whatever the factors are
 
00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
will you be telling us what these
 
00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
factors are so we understand what in
 
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
fact is going into these all these
 
00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
decision points you're talking about
 
00:46:59.930 --> 00:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
that you say right now you're not aware
 
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
of what the what they could be it's a
 
00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
much more complex if I knew how to
 
00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
answer that question as to why we see
 
00:47:08.809 --> 00:47:08.819 align:start position:0%
disproportionate racial outcomes across
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
so many systems in this country
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
um I I wish that I could answer that
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
question I I do not have the depth of
 
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
knowledge to answer that question what I
 
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
can tell you is that there is there's a
 
00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
committee that just met yesterday with
 
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner Eddie Edwards at
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
safety with Partners from across the
 
00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
state that look specifically at this
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
information and review the data about
 
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing and try to figure out
 
00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:32.700 align:start position:0%
what are ways that we can try to better
 
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
impact this outcome
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
but as a result of that can't you report
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
on it what's your what you found I mean
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that if there's a problem
 
00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
and you're correcting something you must
 
00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
be able to talk about what you corrected
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
in other words you keep saying it's so
 
00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
difficult I get all that but I'm not
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
what I'm not getting is why we can't
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
learn what these issues are yeah I have
 
00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
as I said I've I've put together a
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
pretty comprehensive deck of data on
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
exactly this point I'd be happy to come
 
00:47:59.690 --> 00:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
in and talk through both the data and
 
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
both the things that we that we think
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
are impacting that I think I'm probably
 
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
not the only person who could have that
 
00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
conversation I think there's a lot of
 
00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:07.140 align:start position:0%
people who have done work in this space
 
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
in this state that are probably even
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
more qualified than me to be able to go
 
00:48:11.569 --> 00:48:11.579 align:start position:0%
into that including many of the folks
 
00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
that sit on this committee that met
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
some of us think the causes are more
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
tied with poverty neighborhood and
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
fatherless homes rather than race and
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to attribute to that
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
single Factor witness all these other
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
ones seem to be in play that we think
 
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
that should come
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
in that study
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion from committee
 
00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.010 align:start position:0%
further discussion from committee
members

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:42.020 align:start position:0%

all in favor say aye aye opposed no no
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
wish to be recorded I recorded myself
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:13.609 --> 00:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
moving on to tab nine
 
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
we have an item
 
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:30.470 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
again

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
morning Karen Hebert for the division of
 
00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
economic stability for DHHS
 
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:38.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative err for a question
 
00:49:47.809 --> 00:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
tired of me on
 
00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
um I think this is the last one I'm
 
00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:49.670 align:start position:0%
um I think this is the last one I'm
gonna

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
00:49:53.089 --> 00:49:53.099 align:start position:0%
get into I'm just curious as to this is
 
00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
all about mortgage lease payments
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance and so on in terms
 
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
of what the monies are covering
 
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
and I'm just an expansion expanding
 
00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
outdoor spaces and so on
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
but the title of this or the lead in if
 
00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
you will the the headline is it's to
 
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
strengthen Workforce which I assume
 
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.069 align:start position:0%
strengthen Workforce which I assume
means

00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
be able to bring more people in to do
 
00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:14.220 align:start position:0%
the job can you just speak to how the
 
00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:16.140 align:start position:0%
one helps the other
 
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
sure it's a great question thank you so
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
this is entirely about strengthening the
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
workforce and the intent behind this
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
basically is with the reduction in
 
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
operating costs such as mortgages and
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
the other examples in this
 
00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:36.140 align:start position:0%
would free up funding in order to pay
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
either higher wages or better benefits
 
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
for the workforce for the purposes of
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
strengthening the retention and
 
00:50:46.849 --> 00:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
recruitment efforts that are so needed
 
00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:49.700 align:start position:0%
in child care providers
 
00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:51.349 align:start position:0%
in child care providers
follow-up

00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
so when you distribute the funds is
 
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
there going to be some tie-in or
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
expectation that that the result of the
 
00:50:59.809 --> 00:50:59.819 align:start position:0%
savings up to the child care centers
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
will be that that money gets reinvested
 
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
in Staffing as opposed to just
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
reinvested in themselves yes correct so
 
00:51:08.329 --> 00:51:08.339 align:start position:0%
we will we're putting the details
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
together now but we really want to
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
develop a formula that is fair and
 
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:15.180 align:start position:0%
Equitable but providers will need to
 
00:51:17.089 --> 00:51:17.099 align:start position:0%
demonstrate or provide that verification
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
that they did reinvest the funding into
 
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
their Workforce
 
00:51:26.329 --> 00:51:26.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
some of this
 
00:51:34.849 --> 00:51:34.859 align:start position:0%
um infrastructure building seems like
 
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
well take some time
 
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be faster to just
 
00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:42.589 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be faster to just
invest

00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
invest
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
these resources
 
00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.670 align:start position:0%
these resources
into

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
the workforce either through
 
00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
I don't know enrollment based payment or
 
00:51:59.930 --> 00:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
stipends or something that would get
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
the money to these centers to the
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
workforce more quickly why are you
 
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
approaching it
 
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
like it's not the first result it's the
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
second result of the money following up
 
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:15.829 align:start position:0%
second result of the money following up
on

00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative her question it just
 
00:52:21.049 --> 00:52:21.059 align:start position:0%
seems like it's going to take longer and
 
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
it's more indirect
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
sure thank you another excellent
 
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
question so there are this is a
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
multi-faceted issue which really needs a
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
multiple multiple solutions that are
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
both short-term and sustainable for the
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
long term
 
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
so the department put together the child
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
care strengthening plan last year as a
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
result of Senate Bill 446. there are
 
00:52:50.569 --> 00:52:50.579 align:start position:0%
many initiatives that were mentioned in
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
that strengthening plan this is just one
 
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
of them
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
and this is the one that gopher had
 
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
provided the award for
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
so in addition to that we do have a
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
number of initiatives that we're
 
00:53:08.329 --> 00:53:08.339 align:start position:0%
implementing now that may address
 
00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're referring to that
 
00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:13.140 align:start position:0%
are more immediate and that is through
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
the arpa discretionary funding so the
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
state is currently putting together a
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
number of procurements to address a
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
number of the other initiatives
 
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
including a recruitment and retention
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
project that would essentially provide a
 
00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
pilot program with effective strategies
 
00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
for attracting retaining and increasing
 
00:53:38.329 --> 00:53:38.339 align:start position:0%
the Recruitment and strengthening the
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you but part of the problem that
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
we hear is the capacity issue
 
00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:51.049 align:start position:0%
we hear is the capacity issue
so

00:53:51.049 --> 00:53:51.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.059 --> 00:53:52.730 align:start position:0%
 
why

00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:53:56.089 --> 00:53:56.099 align:start position:0%
does creating playgrounds
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
increase capacity for the number of
 
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.770 align:start position:0%
increase capacity for the number of
children

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
that can be cared for in these
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
facilities I'm just not singing that
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
connection sure great thank you so the
 
00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
the idea behind something like a
 
00:54:14.569 --> 00:54:14.579 align:start position:0%
playground so if there is a provider
 
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
that essentially doesn't really have
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of facility but they have
 
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
plans that they would like to be able to
 
00:54:24.109 --> 00:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
provide you know something like a
 
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
playground that needs to be appropriate
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
it needs to be age appropriate and of
 
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.410 align:start position:0%
it needs to be age appropriate and of
quality

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
quality
 
00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
so if they have plans that they're
 
00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
implementing that and that is where they
 
00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
are investing but at the same time
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
having this problem with Recruitment and
 
00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:41.579 align:start position:0%
Retention so that they can't
 
00:54:44.089 --> 00:54:44.099 align:start position:0%
they're not able to bring in the right
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
number of Staff or keep the right number
 
00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
of staff that would match their capacity
 
00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
so there are a number of programs that
 
00:54:54.049 --> 00:54:54.059 align:start position:0%
are operating under capacity because
 
00:54:58.370 --> 00:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
they don't have the workforce to to take
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
on more children that they have slots
 
00:55:00.839 --> 00:55:01.790 align:start position:0%
on more children that they have slots
for

00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:55:05.569 --> 00:55:05.579 align:start position:0%
so by investing in something like you're
 
00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
covering that kind of an operating cost
 
00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
that would significantly improve a
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
provider's facility
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
that would free up those funding so that
 
00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:20.300 align:start position:0%
they can provide they can allow for
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
greater wages or better benefits that
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
would attract more people in to that
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
particular industry with that there are
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
a number of other initiatives going on
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
at the same time to really look at the
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
different pipelines of where where can
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
we really recruit people from number of
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
partners that we want to start to invest
 
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
in including the business Community
 
00:55:47.329 --> 00:55:47.339 align:start position:0%
where we can really look at ways of
 
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
partnering with businesses so that we do
 
00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of those businesses and
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
employees that would be working in
 
00:55:59.170 --> 00:55:59.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
did the depart wide in the department
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
ask for money to do those things rather
 
00:56:10.569 --> 00:56:10.579 align:start position:0%
than this longer term and more indirect
 
00:56:14.569 --> 00:56:14.579 align:start position:0%
approach our request for uh in the child
 
00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
care strengthening plan that was
 
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
submitted to gopher also provided to the
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
legislature we asked for a number of
 
00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
of of items
 
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:29.540 align:start position:0%
um including
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
funding for Recruitment and Retention
 
00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
one of the items included funding to
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
help stabilize further the child care
 
00:56:41.329 --> 00:56:41.339 align:start position:0%
providers so that it would attribute to
 
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention this is the
 
00:56:47.569 --> 00:56:47.579 align:start position:0%
item thus far that has been awarded
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
for the questions on the item
 
00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:55.980 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn a motion to adopt
 
00:56:58.490 --> 00:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
move to adopt
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
Senator gray moves to adopt the item
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley seconds further
 
00:57:05.809 --> 00:57:05.819 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none all in favor say
 
00:57:05.819 --> 00:57:06.410 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none all in favor say
aye

aye
 
00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
opposed no
 
00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
how many knows
 
00:57:11.819 --> 00:57:12.890 align:start position:0%
how many knows
two

00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
moving on to tab 11.
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
item 23 114. did I skip one thank you
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.370 --> 00:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
all right this is Health and Human
 
00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:03.710 align:start position:0%
all right this is Health and Human
Services

00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.849 --> 00:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.329 --> 00:58:10.339 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you
 
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:18.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
scheduled to get
 
00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:27.109 align:start position:0%
 
just

00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:58:32.089 --> 00:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
seems like a sinkhole
 
00:58:32.099 --> 00:58:35.690 align:start position:0%
seems like a sinkhole
and

00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
it just is such a giant amount of money
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
in the budget every year and then
 
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
items like this why
 
00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:49.309 align:start position:0%
items like this why
so

00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
um as as we'll be discussing on uh
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
Monday or Tuesday I believe Medicaid is
 
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
coming to Senate Finance next week
 
00:58:58.370 --> 00:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
um we the the maintenance costs for the
 
00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:01.140 align:start position:0%
mmis system are are significant uh
 
00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
approximately 80 million dollars or so
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
over the biennium
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
um this the the the
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
transfer that that we're requesting here
 
00:59:11.809 --> 00:59:11.819 align:start position:0%
is to fund a recent amendment in Henry I
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want to speak to the
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
details there sure one of the major
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
pieces of this is a function of
 
00:59:20.569 --> 00:59:20.579 align:start position:0%
um when providers query the system and
 
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
get a response on people's eligibility
 
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
as you know our enrollment and Medicaid
 
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
went from 178 000 to to 250 almost 252
 
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
000 at its peak and now with the unwind
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot more need for providers
 
00:59:39.289 --> 00:59:39.299 align:start position:0%
to be able to to be able to reach out
 
00:59:41.809 --> 00:59:41.819 align:start position:0%
and check people's eligibility
 
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
um and we in terms of what was in the
 
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
original amendment to to fund that type
 
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
of service and interaction with the
 
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.069 align:start position:0%
of service and interaction with the
system

00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:59:52.079 --> 00:59:52.670 align:start position:0%
system
um

00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
we need more more opportunities to do
 
00:59:57.650 --> 00:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
that otherwise providers will try to
 
00:59:59.630 --> 00:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
query and they won't be able to get it
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.789 --> 01:00:09.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:16.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
the MMA
 
01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.849 --> 01:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
system has been problematic for many
 
01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:27.299 align:start position:0%
many years
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
and we
 
01:00:31.849 --> 01:00:31.859 align:start position:0%
we talk about this at fiscal we talk
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
about it during the budget cycle we talk
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
about Appropriations we talk about the
 
01:00:39.289 --> 01:00:39.299 align:start position:0%
match we talk about what's being done
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
isn't there any way where there could be
 
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
some uniformity across the country with
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
regard to this system because everybody
 
01:00:51.289 --> 01:00:51.299 align:start position:0%
has to make these reports
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
is it is it isn't that an opportunity to
 
01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
get something that makes that makes
 
01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.390 align:start position:0%
get something that makes that makes
sense

01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.950 align:start position:0%
sense
um

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
other than that
 
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
these kinds of Appropriations even
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
though they're significant matches and
 
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not I I understand that I mean it
 
01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
used to be a 90-10 and now I don't know
 
01:01:14.809 --> 01:01:14.819 align:start position:0%
what the match is now but but indeed
 
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
every year we look we look at this and
 
01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
you give us good rationale I understand
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
that but there's got to be a more
 
01:01:26.089 --> 01:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
uniform system in place
 
01:01:30.349 --> 01:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
that everyone that must report is able
 
01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of
 
01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
I just find this to be incomprehensible
 
01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
I was in the software business for for a
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
while and we were able to do things like
 
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
that but
 
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
this is this occurrence goes on and on
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
and on
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'd like to answer in two
 
01:01:49.559 --> 01:01:50.510 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'd like to answer in two
parts

01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
parts
 
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
um I guess the first part is when you've
 
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
seen one Medicaid Program you've seen
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
one Medicaid Program in many respects
 
01:01:58.970 --> 01:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
unlike software you can take off the
 
01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.170 align:start position:0%
unlike software you can take off the
shelf

01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
shelf
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
um that's not the case because as each
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
state has little idiosyncrasies with
 
01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
respect to how they want the eligibility
 
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
to work and other things the reality is
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
that it's you can't buy in many
 
01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
instances uh information off the
 
01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
software off the shelf
 
01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
I guess I would also say that I think of
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner goulet's here that the
 
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
operation of the system today has vastly
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
improved in the last few years and the
 
01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:33.299 align:start position:0%
second thing is that in which we'll be
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
talking to you at the Senate Finance
 
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
about is whereas you know I think the
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
original system was installed
 
01:02:42.599 --> 01:02:44.030 align:start position:0%
original system was installed
um and

01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
acquired when we were in a
 
01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
fee-for-service system so after we made
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
and this is long before my time after we
 
01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
made that investment we converted to a
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
managed care approach which required a
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
lot of rework to to get the system to to
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
line up with that but that's just an
 
01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
example of you know when you buy it for
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
one function and then put it to use in
 
01:03:08.569 --> 01:03:08.579 align:start position:0%
another function it does require a lot
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
of changes but in terms of how the
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
system is functioning
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
um it is at I think of commissioner
 
01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
glaze behind me I think he would shake
 
01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
his head yes and I've heard him say it
 
01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
at uh at governor and Council because
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
the same kind of concerns that you raise
 
01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
come up at governor and Council as well
 
01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:26.569 align:start position:0%
come up at governor and Council as well
um

01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:26.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
but the other thing that I think from a
 
01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
forward-looking standpoint is the
 
01:03:33.849 --> 01:03:33.859 align:start position:0%
strategy of modularity meaning that
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
rather than relying on one vendor to
 
01:03:38.089 --> 01:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
provide everything
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
um and you're when you go out to bid
 
01:03:42.049 --> 01:03:42.059 align:start position:0%
you're making a massive commitment to
 
01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
one vendor the the strategy going
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
forward is to to
 
01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.450 align:start position:0%
forward is to to
um

01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
put it in pieces so that you can create
 
01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
more Market competition for the
 
01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
components that you're you're buying and
 
01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
that's that's the direction that we're
 
01:03:59.030 --> 01:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
going in in uh and that's honestly in
 
01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
terms of what CMS will support because
 
01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
they've seen these massive systems that
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
are singular vendored have not been
 
01:04:07.789 --> 01:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
inexpensive to run that they're trying
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
to create more competition by creating
 
01:04:12.289 --> 01:04:12.299 align:start position:0%
different modules that get pulled
 
01:04:12.299 --> 01:04:13.309 align:start position:0%
different modules that get pulled
together

01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosemont thank you separately
 
01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
we're um
 
01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
by approving this item losing 10 million
 
01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
dollars of federal funds that's a
 
01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
difference sure
 
01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
um but uh well that's related yeah it's
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
not really a time of my ass but it's
 
01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
this item
 
01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:36.950 align:start position:0%
this item
what

01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.410 align:start position:0%
what
what programs

01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
what programs
 
01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
or Services might be affected by the
 
01:04:44.809 --> 01:04:44.819 align:start position:0%
loss of
 
01:04:47.809 --> 01:04:47.819 align:start position:0%
sure there's 10 million dollars so
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of transfers within the
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
Medicaid accounts that you'll see um
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're moving funds to chip uh based on
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
higher enrollments and the need there
 
01:04:57.289 --> 01:04:57.299 align:start position:0%
we're moving it out of the main Medicaid
 
01:05:00.049 --> 01:05:00.059 align:start position:0%
accounts of the the 7948
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
um we have additional dollars as a
 
01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
result of the 6.2 F map that just phased
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
out April 1. now we're at five percent
 
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
for the time being the
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
um the state face down payments that you
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
see there those were those were under
 
01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
budgeted in the current biennium we do
 
01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
have a prioritized need request that has
 
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:18.299 align:start position:0%
gone unfunded today to 15 million
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
dollars for the current biennium we
 
01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
don't receive any match on that payment
 
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
it's 100 General funds and so by moving
 
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
that out of the 7948 we're reducing the
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
50 50 match and that's the 10 million
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
dollars of federal funds that you see in
 
01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
the reduction there thank you you're
 
01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:35.930 align:start position:0%
the reduction there thank you you're
welcome

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:39.049 --> 01:05:39.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
so that's several I'll give you what
 
01:05:45.289 --> 01:05:45.299 align:start position:0%
should be an easy one first but I'm
 
01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:47.220 align:start position:0%
interested if you can answer it
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
this makes reference to account number
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
5191 special Medical Services
 
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
I could not find 5191 in any of the
 
01:05:58.849 --> 01:05:58.859 align:start position:0%
documents that I have
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
um 5191 is within the Bureau of
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
Developmental Services it's the special
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or medical services it is
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
contained within the
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
so I can't look it up right now because
 
01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
I don't have what you'd have but I'll
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
tell you why I did look it up I didn't
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
see it I have the an actual spreadsheet
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
for the h
 
01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:33.299 align:start position:0%
the HP hb1 is it past the house it's not
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
in there and I also have a document
 
01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:37.140 align:start position:0%
produced by LBA which is on their
 
01:06:38.809 --> 01:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
website which compares
 
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
the governor's request to
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
what we did in the house and I couldn't
 
01:06:46.490 --> 01:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
search for it in there either and I
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
could search for anything else so if if
 
01:06:50.569 --> 01:06:50.579 align:start position:0%
you if you look at the current House
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
Bill one
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
um for the it is on page 618 of the
 
01:06:57.289 --> 01:06:57.299 align:start position:0%
current operating budget okay
 
01:06:59.329 --> 01:06:59.339 align:start position:0%
okay page six eighteen page six eighteen
 
01:06:59.339 --> 01:07:00.529 align:start position:0%
okay page six eighteen page six eighteen
correct

01:07:00.529 --> 01:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
all right I guess that was the easy one
 
01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:05.329 align:start position:0%
all right I guess that was the easy one
good

01:07:05.329 --> 01:07:05.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
so now get to the ones I really care
 
01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:08.510 align:start position:0%
so now get to the ones I really care
about

01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
so 7948 which is Medicaid services and
 
01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
you talked about a lot of money coming
 
01:07:15.529 --> 01:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
out of that one correct
 
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
okay 13 million dollars of if I'm not
 
01:07:20.089 --> 01:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
mistaken which says that there was 13
 
01:07:21.529 --> 01:07:21.539 align:start position:0%
million dollars in there that would have
 
01:07:21.539 --> 01:07:22.970 align:start position:0%
million dollars in there that would have
lapsed

01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
lapsed
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
or the will lapse and I'm just curious
 
01:07:29.329 --> 01:07:29.339 align:start position:0%
as to oh and and I might add that 30
 
01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
million relapse in that account this
 
01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.690 align:start position:0%
million relapse in that account this
year

01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
you requested and we granted if I'm not
 
01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
reading this incorrectly for fy2425 an
 
01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
increase of 25 million dollars in year
 
01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:43.140 align:start position:0%
one and 35 million dollars a year to
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
so we're potentially lapsing 13 million
 
01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
from a much smaller budget and we're yet
 
01:07:49.609 --> 01:07:49.619 align:start position:0%
we're still we're still asked to
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
increase the budget over the coming
 
01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
years so really two two questions why
 
01:07:55.609 --> 01:07:55.619 align:start position:0%
was the 13 million I brought up during
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
the budget cycle and why was so much
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
asked for in the next biennium sure so
 
01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
when when we're looking at the Medicaid
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
Program we're looking across all of the
 
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
accounts and the projections that we're
 
01:08:07.849 --> 01:08:07.859 align:start position:0%
seeing the state phase down has been a
 
01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
known shortfall that we've had uh since
 
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
since July 1 of of the prior State
 
01:08:15.289 --> 01:08:15.299 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so when we look at those
 
01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
calculations we make that assumption
 
01:08:18.769 --> 01:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
with what we're going to be carrying
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
forward or what we'll have available to
 
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:27.179 align:start position:0%
so 7948 is the state phase down account
 
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
no it is not the state phase down
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
account but when we look at the the
 
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
entirety of the Medicaid Program chip
 
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
standard Medicaid uh State face down
 
01:08:37.729 --> 01:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
we're we're looking at those numbers in
 
01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:40.259 align:start position:0%
totality to figure out what are we going
 
01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
to be needing
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
um are we going to be sure are we going
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
to be lapsing funds
 
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:46.799 align:start position:0%
well that's great but we're talking
 
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
about one particular count 7948
 
01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:51.299 align:start position:0%
which apparently would have lapsed will
 
01:08:52.849 --> 01:08:52.859 align:start position:0%
lapse 13 million if we don't approve
 
01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:53.749 align:start position:0%
lapse 13 million if we don't approve
this

01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
number one and number two in the next
 
01:08:59.150 --> 01:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
biennium it's budgeted at 60 million
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
dollars more than this biennium so can
 
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
you just speak to both of those how can
 
01:09:05.650 --> 01:09:05.660 align:start position:0%
you square both of those circles sure
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
with respect to the 2223 budget the
 
01:09:12.829 --> 01:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
Assumption was that the federal Public
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
Health Emergency in the beginning of the
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
unwind would start in October of uh 22.
 
01:09:22.249 --> 01:09:22.259 align:start position:0%
it's starting in March of 23 yeah
 
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
actually effectively April 1st of 23. so
 
01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
that was one sort of unknown to all of
 
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
us I think throughout the sort of that
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
period there was every 90 days it had to
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
be reauthorized and there was no no
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
clear signal in terms of what what would
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
be expected so that was our best
 
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
sense of it when the budget was put
 
01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:46.460 align:start position:0%
together for 22.23
 
01:09:52.150 --> 01:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
we also with respect to the 24-25 budget
 
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
the fmap percentage right is in the
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
Consolidated appropriation Act is being
 
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
reduced from the 6.2 percent to the five
 
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
to the to the two and a half to the one
 
01:10:04.729 --> 01:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
the criteria in which we had to to do
 
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
the unwind was also not known as what
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
we've been you know finalized as that
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
you can only do one-ninth of your
 
01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:18.070 align:start position:0%
you can only do one-ninth of your
population

01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
so that's another factor that goes into
 
01:10:22.729 --> 01:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
it we we have a request in the current
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
budget because we're concerned about the
 
01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
unwind and how fast we're actually able
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
to to to uh to unwind and what level of
 
01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
appeals so far in the online you know
 
01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
with one month's experience it's gone
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
according to plan but it's pretty early
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
in the process to to conclude how it's
 
01:10:44.209 --> 01:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
going to play out because we the way we
 
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
approached our unwind was on a risk
 
01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
basis those people we thought most
 
01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
likely would close because they were
 
01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
over income or were likely not were
 
01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
likely ineligible or not used any
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
services in the past year that's who we
 
01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
started with so the likelihood that
 
01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to close and stay close as
 
01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
high as we get into the the more
 
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
challenging populations the people that
 
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
you know have have coverage and have
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
shown use of Medical Services it's I
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
think the the variability and how that's
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
going to play out is is a little bit
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
more unknown and certainly something
 
01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.890 align:start position:0%
more unknown and certainly something
that

01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
um you know we would want to keep you
 
01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like you're saying that
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
this increased fmap was more than we
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
needed to cover the expanded populations
 
01:11:36.649 --> 01:11:36.659 align:start position:0%
under the emergency situation
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
but as that goes away
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to the remainder of the
 
01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
funding that we in other words the
 
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
equivalent funding we have right now
 
01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
this biennium is not going to be enough
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
to cover the lowered theoretically as we
 
01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
phase people off to the extent of 70
 
01:11:59.090 --> 01:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
so the the online will run through
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
December okay and then there is medical
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
inflation that is occurring
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
um and then there was some anticipation
 
01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
so we we figured we could operate within
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
about a three percent change in sort of
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
medical inflation and then whatever with
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
respect to um
 
01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
some level of rate increase we
 
01:12:26.689 --> 01:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
anticipated in terms of at the time
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
early on you know about a three percent
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
which turned out to be a a very low
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
assumption for 24.25 given what
 
01:12:37.729 --> 01:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
um you know has come to be known of the
 
01:12:39.649 --> 01:12:39.659 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage being even more
 
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
severe than what we started planning for
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
it but that's that's why you're seeing
 
01:12:48.610 --> 01:12:48.620 align:start position:0%
an increase in in the 24-25 budget
 
01:12:51.649 --> 01:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
certainly to the extent that our
 
01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
contracts are not um their price
 
01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
limitations if you will if we spend less
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
because we do better on enrollment and
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
and what have you that that money isn't
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
is isn't going to be spent except to
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
cover something like a known shortfall
 
01:13:12.649 --> 01:13:12.659 align:start position:0%
you know we this particular shortfall is
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit um
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
hard to to work through and I understand
 
01:13:18.649 --> 01:13:18.659 align:start position:0%
there's so many issues that come at the
 
01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm working through but
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
this is a fixed dollar amount that we're
 
01:13:25.370 --> 01:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
we're told that we have to pay for drug
 
01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
coverage for people who are duly
 
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
eligible in the Medicaid Program it's a
 
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's a fixed premium per person per per
 
01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
year per month and so when we bring
 
01:13:38.689 --> 01:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
forth the number I understand it's been
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
hard to to take everything in but that
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
one is I think it's been several
 
01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
bienniums where we haven't been able to
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
make a good case when we're presenting
 
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
it enough to to convince to to budget
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
directly for that as opposed to covering
 
01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
it in a different fashion
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
one last question
 
01:13:59.330 --> 01:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
firstly the last part he didn't
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
understand but I'll deal with that later
 
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:01.910 align:start position:0%
understand but I'll deal with that later
okay

01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
um but more importantly for this note as
 
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
a whole and we've seen these several
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
times over the past well since I've been
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
um and I've asked as I were pretty sure
 
01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
I've asked maybe you've forgotten that
 
01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:16.140 align:start position:0%
I'd really like to see actual
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets provided to LBA when you
 
01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
have notes like this
 
01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
um so that I can actually understand
 
01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:24.780 align:start position:0%
where the money's coming from and where
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's going to it was not easy for me I
 
01:14:28.729 --> 01:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
understand they've got a lot of verbiage
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
in here and you got some pictures that
 
01:14:32.209 --> 01:14:32.219 align:start position:0%
sort of show some of the going on that's
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
not really clear what's happening
 
01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
um I'd really like to see that so like
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
so I can access something I can study to
 
01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
understand where it's coming from where
 
01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
it's going to because I'm always curious
 
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
as I was just asking about here how did
 
01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
you happen to have so much money in this
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
account that we didn't that we were
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
unaware of particularly just as it went
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
through a budget cycle so that's just a
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
commentary that I really hope that
 
01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:52.020 align:start position:0%
you'll please do that in the future
 
01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you we'd be happy to do that
 
01:14:58.010 --> 01:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald for a question
 
01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
question about the state phase down if
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
we've known
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
since July and I'm not sure which July
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
maybe it was the beginning of the budget
 
01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
that we had a shortfall
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
why did the department lapse
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
um along the way through
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
last fiscal year I think it was
 
01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
something like
 
01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
I know it was more than 30 million
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
dollars but it was maybe more than 50.
 
01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
why didn't we
 
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
hang on to that additional Revenue
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
and supplant
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
General funds along the way to make up
 
01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
the difference in this phase down
 
01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
so we we have to pay the federal
 
01:15:58.010 --> 01:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
government with General funds where
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
these payments are made CMS and we're
 
01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
prohibited from supplanting generous
 
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
federal funds and general funds that's
 
01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
that there's prohibition on that so
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed to do that which is
 
01:16:14.890 --> 01:16:14.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
further questions on the item
 
01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
I wanted to item
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
Senator gray moves that we adopted item
 
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
number one three four
 
01:16:27.290 --> 01:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley seconds is there any
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:16:31.729 --> 01:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
all in favor to say aye aye opposed no
 
01:16:31.739 --> 01:16:33.530 align:start position:0%
all in favor to say aye aye opposed no
no

01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
one no
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
now we'll move on to tab 11.
 
01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
we have a luminous report of vehicles
 
01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
that didn't achieve
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
what I would like is an explanation of
 
01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:58.550 align:start position:0%
what I would like is an explanation of
why

01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
I remember when this was twelve thousand
 
01:17:05.229 --> 01:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.239 --> 01:17:06.770 align:start position:0%
 
8300

01:17:06.770 --> 01:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
8300
 
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
per year and
 
01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
maybe an explanation of why
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
it has
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
come down year over year and buy the
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
also curious have we saved any money
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
from all these miles that haven't been
 
01:17:22.679 --> 01:17:25.850 align:start position:0%
from all these miles that haven't been
driven

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
so good morning uh Sherry Rockburn
 
01:17:30.169 --> 01:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner Department of
 
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
so um there's a formula that we used and
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's we use it each biennium to
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
calculate the mileage what we call the
 
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
Benchmark mileage so as you remember as
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
you noted um chairman
 
01:17:47.209 --> 01:17:47.219 align:start position:0%
ten thousand at one point it's down to
 
01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
around eight thousand and that formula
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
is based on what we're actually spending
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
um in costs so we have direct cost and
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
operating costs that we use and we look
 
01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
at the federal reimbursement rate to
 
01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
calculate an average cost per mile
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
um the spreadsheet is the very last page
 
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
in your packets if you want to take a
 
01:18:10.130 --> 01:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
look at it so some of this is just a
 
01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
function of the formula it's not an
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
arbitrary mileage number that's
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
generated we actually calculate the
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
mileage based on sort of the average
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
number of vehicles we have the average
 
01:18:22.570 --> 01:18:22.580 align:start position:0%
cost that's happening and the change in
 
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
the federal reimbursement rates
 
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
and so just as a comparison I'll just
 
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
give you a little background is while
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
this year this waivers for 119 vehicles
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
that fell below that mileage that
 
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
agencies had to ask for directly to
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
retain those Vehicles last year the
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
number was 165 vehicles
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
and the year before that was 111
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
so just to kind of give you a reference
 
01:18:51.649 --> 01:18:51.659 align:start position:0%
of you know is 119 high is it low it's
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know somewhat um in between the
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
last two years over the three year
 
01:18:57.709 --> 01:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
period this number hasn't fluctuated
 
01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
significantly as you know the federal
 
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
mileage rate has um has traditionally
 
01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
been increasing about every six months
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
or so so that's really the the nature of
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
this we don't determine I'll say exactly
 
01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
if an agency should keep it or not we
 
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
ask the agencies for input for whether
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
they can they have a need for that
 
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
vehicle or not in terms of savings I
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
think the hard thing is while the
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
mileage driven has gone down as you know
 
01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
the gas price that the pump has not so I
 
01:19:29.209 --> 01:19:29.219 align:start position:0%
think that I wouldn't say we've had a
 
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
significant savings even though the
 
01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
was that statement no significant
 
01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:37.790 align:start position:0%
was that statement no significant
savings

01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
savings
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
no significant savings correct
 
01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
is there any possibilities as you go
 
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
through these year after year from same
 
01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
agencies that have low mileage vehicles
 
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
that they could do without one or two
 
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
especially where they have pool vehicles
 
01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
and and there are always five vehicles
 
01:19:56.689 --> 01:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
and there's two or three of them that
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
don't make it every year why do they
 
01:19:59.810 --> 01:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
need them
 
01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
we can continue to
 
01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
um scrub that information when it comes
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
to us we do ask each commissioner to
 
01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
submit information to our department
 
01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
with a justification as sort of why they
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
need those Vehicles retained those
 
01:20:15.050 --> 01:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
letters are attached to your fiscal
 
01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
packet if you wanted to look at any
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
agency individually and they probably
 
01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
could speak to it better than us we
 
01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
really ask for their their input
 
01:20:24.169 --> 01:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
directly I read a lot of them and they
 
01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
all seem to sound the same about covid
 
01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
working from home that sort of thing for
 
01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
this last year but it seems like perhaps
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
going forward if they're not using these
 
01:20:37.970 --> 01:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
vehicles as much they don't need as many
 
01:20:41.930 --> 01:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
so I remember at a time when we went to
 
01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
just four cylinder engines
 
01:20:46.490 --> 01:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
small cars it doesn't seem like that
 
01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
trend has continued
 
01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
we've tried a few different things in
 
01:20:52.729 --> 01:20:52.739 align:start position:0%
the fleet pool we've also tried to look
 
01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
at leasing Vehicles instead of
 
01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
state-owned and that had didn't produce
 
01:21:00.050 --> 01:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
the savings that we had anticipated
 
01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
um I think this past year we've also
 
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
struggled with as most individuals the
 
01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
supply of vehicles so some of the
 
01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
vehicles that we've traditionally have
 
01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:11.219 align:start position:0%
requested at dealerships we've you know
 
01:21:12.530 --> 01:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
have been a little bit limited as well
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
so that's been a little bit of a
 
01:21:13.679 --> 01:21:15.110 align:start position:0%
so that's been a little bit of a
struggle

01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
struggle
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
what I didn't see in here is the total
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
number of vehicles you're tracking
 
01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
I did have that um I believe that there
 
01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:23.330 align:start position:0%
I did have that um I believe that there
is

01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:21:25.490 --> 01:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
um and it's on a very small print on one
 
01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
of the pages about just over 700
 
01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
Vehicles 721 vehicles
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions from the
 
01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:35.750 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions from the
committee

01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:21:40.330 --> 01:21:40.340 align:start position:0%
are you ready to adopt the item
 
01:21:43.729 --> 01:21:43.739 align:start position:0%
representative Leachman moves the item
 
01:21:45.890 --> 01:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
Senator dalessandro seconds further
 
01:21:48.410 --> 01:21:48.420 align:start position:0%

pose no
 
01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
moving on to tab 12
 
01:22:05.229 --> 01:22:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:08.209 --> 01:22:08.219 align:start position:0%
any I have any questions on the item I
 
01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
have some questions Mr chairman
 
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
so representative leishman has a
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman members of the
 
01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
committee for the record I'm Joseph
 
01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
malka chairman of the Liquor Commission
 
01:22:37.729 --> 01:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
with me is our CEO James Vera and CFO
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
Tina Demir so we'd be happy to answer
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
any questions you might have thank you
 
01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
my question so I noticed in your
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
narrative this store was not one of your
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
profitable it was one of your least
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
profitable stores and it was interesting
 
01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
to see that they'd have some flooding
 
01:22:58.729 --> 01:22:58.739 align:start position:0%
issues here and so forth I guess the
 
01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
concern I have is picking a store that's
 
01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
at least profitable and especially in a
 
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
community that borders Massachusetts and
 
01:23:09.169 --> 01:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
not too far from Vermont the impact it
 
01:23:11.209 --> 01:23:11.219 align:start position:0%
has on the community of Winchester which
 
01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
is a struggling town so I just curious
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
about your comments
 
01:23:19.729 --> 01:23:19.739 align:start position:0%
well uh it was the least profitable
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
store the least profitable full-time
 
01:23:24.290 --> 01:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
store when we closed it it had two
 
01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
full-time employees and five part-time
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
employees and it's uh it's very close to
 
01:23:32.689 --> 01:23:32.699 align:start position:0%
the Keene store in the Hinsdale store
 
01:23:34.970 --> 01:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
which are both much larger Footprints
 
01:23:38.290 --> 01:23:38.300 align:start position:0%
this store was about 4 000 square feet
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
at the time the the
 
01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
ashlot River flooded the store we closed
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
the store James was in contact with the
 
01:23:48.239 --> 01:23:49.610 align:start position:0%
the store James was in contact with the
landlord

01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
who refused to play any damages
 
01:23:55.370 --> 01:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh and then we use the store as a
 
01:23:58.430 --> 01:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
storage facility for some shelving and
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
other things we move the product to the
 
01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
larger stores in the area which are
 
01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:05.900 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars higher in sales
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
to answer the question as to the effect
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
on the community I'm not really sure
 
01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:15.719 align:start position:0%
that it had an effect on the community
 
01:24:18.649 --> 01:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
as far as what we do as far as the the
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
business that we are in because we have
 
01:24:24.410 --> 01:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
stores that are a couple of miles away
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
and serve those customers in Hinsdale on
 
01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
the Vermont Border in Keene in range all
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
within that area and as you know
 
01:24:37.850 --> 01:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
that area had a plethora of small stores
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
for a number of years quite frankly uh
 
01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
underwhelming and underserving the
 
01:24:47.209 --> 01:24:47.219 align:start position:0%
community and we are trying as we did in
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
West Chesterfield as we did in range as
 
01:24:52.189 --> 01:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
we look forward to do in a couple other
 
01:24:54.770 --> 01:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
communities out there to build larger
 
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:57.120 align:start position:0%

01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%

01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
my question is about the expenses of
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
your office
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to apologize up front I've had
 
01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
a bad cold and my wife thinks I'm
 
01:29:05.649 --> 01:29:05.659 align:start position:0%
ignoring her I'm not
 
01:29:08.689 --> 01:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
telling I'm having trouble hearing okay
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'll try to speak loudly my question is
 
01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
about the expenses of your office when I
 
01:29:18.410 --> 01:29:18.420 align:start position:0%
total up
 
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
um your report in your expectation for
 
01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
this year it's
 
01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
um somewhere approaching a million
 
01:29:28.610 --> 01:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
dollars for this year just wondering if
 
01:29:32.090 --> 01:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
you project the same level expense for
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
the next two years or if you have a
 
01:29:35.890 --> 01:29:35.900 align:start position:0%
sense of
 
01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
what the expense of your office will be
 
01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
that will be deducted from the fund
 
01:29:45.169 --> 01:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
personal thank you it's it's a very good
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
question and it's perpetling to us
 
01:29:48.719 --> 01:29:49.310 align:start position:0%
question and it's perpetling to us
um

01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:51.890 --> 01:29:51.900 align:start position:0%
I've been in that office now for three
 
01:29:53.209 --> 01:29:53.219 align:start position:0%
and a half months
 
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
we have received
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
claims as we've identified and this
 
01:30:01.370 --> 01:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
committee knows probably better than I
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
the back story on all of this that
 
01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
brought about this YDC claims office
 
01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.169 align:start position:0%
brought about this YDC claims office
uh

01:30:09.169 --> 01:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
it's hard to know at this point how many
 
01:30:14.330 --> 01:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
claims will find their way to our
 
01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:16.010 align:start position:0%
claims will find their way to our
doorstep

01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
doorstep
 
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
of the claims that have been filed to
 
01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:21.010 align:start position:0%
of the claims that have been filed to
date

01:30:21.010 --> 01:30:21.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:24.290 --> 01:30:24.300 align:start position:0%
with one exception none of them are
 
01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
cases that are already in the Superior
 
01:30:27.239 --> 01:30:28.610 align:start position:0%
cases that are already in the Superior
Court

01:30:28.610 --> 01:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
Court
 
01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
so part of the intention of the fund I
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
think was to have cases migrate from
 
01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
this Prairie Court to the claims fund of
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
which there are about 800.
 
01:30:42.890 --> 01:30:42.900 align:start position:0%
the claims we have received to date with
 
01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
one exception have not been filed in
 
01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
this prayer Court
 
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
so that group of cases which are
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds are remaining in
 
01:30:53.639 --> 01:30:55.010 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds are remaining in
place

01:30:55.010 --> 01:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
and so it's hard to know whether they
 
01:31:00.169 --> 01:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
will migrate in time
 
01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
or none and if they migrate in time our
 
01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
office will be busier than it is now and
 
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
expenses that we try to project
 
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
or expenses of an office that's
 
01:31:17.930 --> 01:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
doing a very good job with a high level
 
01:31:21.490 --> 01:31:21.500 align:start position:0%
of cases if we don't have the cases
 
01:31:24.890 --> 01:31:24.900 align:start position:0%
expenses may be lost it's just just hard
 
01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
Senator to know after three months I
 
01:31:32.890 --> 01:31:32.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
the first trial in the superior court of
 
01:31:39.530 --> 01:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
one of these sex abuse cases has
 
01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
apparently been scheduled
 
01:31:44.330 --> 01:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
for April of next year
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
12 months from now
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
the lawyers involved in that case
 
01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
and the lawyers who have hundreds of
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
these cases I have no idea the severity
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
of them I don't know them
 
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
they may decide to stay put
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
they may decide to say let's see what
 
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
happens next April we'll have a jury
 
01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:08.930 align:start position:0%
happens next April we'll have a jury
trial

01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
trial
 
01:32:11.629 --> 01:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
and depending on what happens there we
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
may be doing a lot more business in the
 
01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
claims office we may be doing Less
 
01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:17.450 align:start position:0%
claims office we may be doing Less
business

01:32:17.450 --> 01:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:32:20.689 --> 01:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
and in the backdrop of all of that
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
is the statute of limitations which this
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
legislature wisely created
 
01:32:29.689 --> 01:32:29.699 align:start position:0%
so the statute of limitations for filing
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
Acclaim with us at the end of December
 
01:32:34.189 --> 01:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
of 2024.
 
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
the first trial in the Supreme Court
 
01:32:40.010 --> 01:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
unless it's resolved will be April of
 
01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:41.750 align:start position:0%
unless it's resolved will be April of
2024.

01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
2024.
 
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
depending on the result in that case
 
01:32:45.649 --> 01:32:45.659 align:start position:0%
depending on whether it's appeal to our
 
01:32:47.810 --> 01:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I have no idea
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
the statute could run
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
my location is still alive
 
01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
and so if lawyers are waiting
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
to see what happens in the court system
 
01:33:04.129 --> 01:33:04.139 align:start position:0%
by the time they realize good better and
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
different the door may be closed here
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
so the claims process as you well know
 
01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:12.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't go on forever
 
01:33:15.950 --> 01:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
what I would be interested in doing and
 
01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
and I think you know you created the job
 
01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:22.139 align:start position:0%
and I give you Kudos I mean that for
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
creating this
 
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
it was exactly the right thing to do
 
01:33:29.090 --> 01:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
there's a fair amount of misinformation
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
out there there's a fair amount of
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
ignorance out there about what this is
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
really about and how it's really going
 
01:33:39.129 --> 01:33:39.139 align:start position:0%
to work
 
01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
this legislature decided and I think
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
wisely to create this fund
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
to do it in a way that was trauma
 
01:33:48.719 --> 01:33:50.270 align:start position:0%
to do it in a way that was trauma
informed

01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
informed
 
01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
critically important and everyone saw
 
01:33:52.679 --> 01:33:53.870 align:start position:0%
critically important and everyone saw
that

01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:56.209 --> 01:33:56.219 align:start position:0%
the court system as you know as good as
 
01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
it is is not trauma-informed it's often
 
01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:00.590 align:start position:0%
it is is not trauma-informed it's often
trauma-inducing

01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
trauma-inducing
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
so in terms of
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to accomplish here
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
what you put in place I think is exactly
 
01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:10.669 align:start position:0%
what you put in place I think is exactly
right

01:34:10.669 --> 01:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:34:13.209 --> 01:34:13.219 align:start position:0%
if the legislature is interested in
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
hearing from a neutral I am totally
 
01:34:17.450 --> 01:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
neutral here
 
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
I do not have a horse in this race I'm
 
01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
proud to be the administrator I want to
 
01:34:24.050 --> 01:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
do the right thing
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm pretty circumscribed by the
 
01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
statute with the Caps not complaining
 
01:34:34.610 --> 01:34:34.620 align:start position:0%
that's that's what it is
 
01:34:37.729 --> 01:34:37.739 align:start position:0%
but over the last three or four or five
 
01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
months I've had a number of discussions
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
with counsel
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
I've had one meeting with all Council
 
01:34:45.709 --> 01:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
about eight or ten of them I have most
 
01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
of these cases I have another meeting
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
scheduled with them
 
01:34:52.129 --> 01:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
at the end of this month
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
I've been reaching out to the Department
 
01:34:55.729 --> 01:34:55.739 align:start position:0%
of Corrections I mean I've really been
 
01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
trying to touch base with the
 
01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
stakeholders I want to learn as much as
 
01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
I can
 
01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day my answers are
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as yours and the same
 
01:35:07.610 --> 01:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
as the people
 
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
who were sexually assaulted or
 
01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
physically assaulted
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
and I want to resolve these cases in a
 
01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:16.510 align:start position:0%
and I want to resolve these cases in a
trauma-informed

01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed
 
01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
confidential if the claimants choose to
 
01:35:22.729 --> 01:35:22.739 align:start position:0%
keep it as such and most will I believe
 
01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
process that's reasonably prompt
 
01:35:29.770 --> 01:35:29.780 align:start position:0%
trauma informed
 
01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
but if you're interested at some point I
 
01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
know you have a long day today
 
01:35:37.610 --> 01:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
after three or four months of dealing
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
with it and having those conversations I
 
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
do have some thoughts about what you
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
might consider doing
 
01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
to bring more people into the system
 
01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
some of them I think would cost nothing
 
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
some of them might cause something in
 
01:35:57.890 --> 01:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
some of those cases
 
01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:59.390 align:start position:0%
some of those cases
but

01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:36:03.050 --> 01:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
as someone who's running that office now
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
and knowing the intention of this
 
01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:06.410 align:start position:0%
and knowing the intention of this
legislature

01:36:06.410 --> 01:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:36:10.129 --> 01:36:10.139 align:start position:0%
I think it would be profoundly said
 
01:36:13.129 --> 01:36:13.139 align:start position:0%
20 months from now they have the Fun
 
01:36:13.139 --> 01:36:14.390 align:start position:0%
20 months from now they have the Fun
close

01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
close
 
01:36:17.330 --> 01:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
and not many people who came into the
 
01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:18.229 align:start position:0%
and not many people who came into the
system

01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
at that point the only place to go is
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
the court system with all its attendance
 
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.669 align:start position:0%
the court system with all its attendance
stress

01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
stress
 
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
and all its attendant press
 
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day that won't
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
accomplish what you want in my view
 
01:36:37.689 --> 01:36:37.699 align:start position:0%
it certainly won't accomplish a
 
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed resolution
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
and so if there's interest at some time
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
I'd love to sit down with all of you
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
some of you
 
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
just to share some thoughts obviously
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
you're free to reject every one of them
 
01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
I understand that
 
01:36:58.250 --> 01:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
my goal is to make this work
 
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
because the system you've created I
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
think is inherently fair I I don't have
 
01:37:04.850 --> 01:37:04.860 align:start position:0%
any doubt about it I wouldn't be
 
01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
associated with it if I thought
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
otherwise I know a lot of people here
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
did a lot of hard work to get to this
 
01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
point the attorney general has been very
 
01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
Cooperative with our office
 
01:37:18.649 --> 01:37:18.659 align:start position:0%
I'm independent I'm neutral but I deal
 
01:37:20.330 --> 01:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office I
 
01:37:22.669 --> 01:37:22.679 align:start position:0%
deal openly with climate Council
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
I want this system to work
 
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
and I think it may require some
 
01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
adjustments to meet the goals you want
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
and if there's ever any interest I'd be
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:42.600 align:start position:0%

introduction Steve I'm presenting to you
 
01:39:19.129 --> 01:39:19.139 align:start position:0%
today the results of the state of New
 
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Federal single audit for the
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
year ended June 30th 2022. this is as
 
01:39:26.930 --> 01:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
you know a compliance audit
 
01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
the total federal expenditures reported
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
on the schedule of federal expenditures
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
and awards was 3.5 billion dollars and
 
01:39:35.570 --> 01:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
was approximately a billion dollars less
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
than the year before
 
01:39:39.229 --> 01:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
that is primarily related to the
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
decrease of co-fed funding of which 900
 
01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
million was directly related to the
 
01:39:45.649 --> 01:39:45.659 align:start position:0%
unemployment program
 
01:39:48.530 --> 01:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
section e of is where the CFA is located
 
01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
in your boundary port with the green
 
01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:51.649 align:start position:0%
in your boundary port with the green
cover

01:39:51.649 --> 01:39:51.659 align:start position:0%
cover
 
01:39:54.169 --> 01:39:54.179 align:start position:0%
and on page one
 
01:39:56.689 --> 01:39:56.699 align:start position:0%
um you will see the schedule of federal
 
01:40:00.169 --> 01:40:00.179 align:start position:0%
expenditures and awards which is listed
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
by federal agency as well as aln number
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
the total expenditures also include
 
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
included within the total expenditures
 
01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
as required to be reported is the amount
 
01:40:12.649 --> 01:40:12.659 align:start position:0%
of the password to sub-recipients and
 
01:40:14.090 --> 01:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
this year there was a total pass-through
 
01:40:17.209 --> 01:40:17.219 align:start position:0%
of 783 million dollars
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
the sifa is prepared by the state as a
 
01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
part of the audit we review the sifa and
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
perform a variety of procedures to
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
determine the completeness and accuracy
 
01:40:29.209 --> 01:40:29.219 align:start position:0%
of the sifa that it was properly
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
prepared as a part of our opinion which
 
01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
begins on page D3 we concluded that the
 
01:40:37.610 --> 01:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
sifa is fairly stated in all material
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
respects in relation to the basic
 
01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:42.179 align:start position:0%
financial statements as a whole we
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
previously presented on the basic
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
financial statements and provided a
 
01:40:48.590 --> 01:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
clean opinion on those
 
01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
as outlined by the uniform guidance
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
requirements we are not required to
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
audit every program on the CFA instead
 
01:40:56.930 --> 01:40:56.940 align:start position:0%
we are required to focus our audit on
 
01:40:59.149 --> 01:40:59.159 align:start position:0%
certain large dollar programs as
 
01:41:01.729 --> 01:41:01.739 align:start position:0%
identified as type A programs and higher
 
01:41:04.129 --> 01:41:04.139 align:start position:0%
risk type B programs per the uniform
 
01:41:04.139 --> 01:41:05.270 align:start position:0%
risk type B programs per the uniform
guidance

01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
01:41:08.689 --> 01:41:08.699 align:start position:0%
for the year ended June 30th 2022 the
 
01:41:12.050 --> 01:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
type a major program threshold was 10.6
 
01:41:14.930 --> 01:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
million dollars as shown in our summary
 
01:41:18.290 --> 01:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
of audit reports on page F1
 
01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
the amount is noted that the summary of
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
the Arvada reports begins on page F1 but
 
01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
the announcement is noted on page F3
 
01:41:28.189 --> 01:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
that threshold determines our type A
 
01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
programs there was 25 Federal programs
 
01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
for the state that had received funding
 
01:41:35.450 --> 01:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
or expenditures incurred of greater than
 
01:41:37.250 --> 01:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
10.6 million
 
01:41:39.169 --> 01:41:39.179 align:start position:0%
the largest be in your Medicaid Program
 
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
at 1.8 billion dollars
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
the uniform guidance requires Auditors
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
to perform risk assessments over each
 
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
program that meets or exceeds that type
 
01:41:49.850 --> 01:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
a threshold
 
01:41:51.530 --> 01:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
to determine which programs will be
 
01:41:54.169 --> 01:41:54.179 align:start position:0%
audited once the type a threshold risk
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
assessment is determined the risk
 
01:41:58.910 --> 01:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
assessments are performed over the type
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
B to identify which programs are will be
 
01:42:03.410 --> 01:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
determined high risk and subject to our
 
01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:04.490 align:start position:0%
determined high risk and subject to our
audit

01:42:04.490 --> 01:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
audit
 
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
this year was unique the federal
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
government as you know deemed 10
 
01:42:11.689 --> 01:42:11.699 align:start position:0%
programs to be higher risk historically
 
01:42:14.450 --> 01:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
only Medicaid was deemed higher risk so
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
taking this into account and Performing
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
our required risk assessment process we
 
01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
identified a total of 19 major programs
 
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
as you may recall that is greater than
 
01:42:26.209 --> 01:42:26.219 align:start position:0%
the previous two years as audited
 
01:42:26.219 --> 01:42:27.530 align:start position:0%
the previous two years as audited
programs

01:42:27.530 --> 01:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:42:30.229 --> 01:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
of those 19 programs 16 rear type A
 
01:42:30.239 --> 01:42:32.390 align:start position:0%
of those 19 programs 16 rear type A
programs

01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
and three uh three were type B programs
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
the type B programs all three of them
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
were deemed higher risk programs by the
 
01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
those were airport Improvement program
 
01:42:47.570 --> 01:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
Federal Transit and then provider relief
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
in addition of the 18 audit programs 10
 
01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
of those had been audited in the
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
previous year the June 30th 2021 audit
 
01:42:58.609 --> 01:42:58.619 align:start position:0%
and were required to be re-audited as a
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
result of the findings in the prior year
 
01:43:03.169 --> 01:43:03.179 align:start position:0%

and LIHEAP
 
01:43:17.689 --> 01:43:17.699 align:start position:0%
as a result of our audit procedures
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
performed we identified 32 reportable
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
findings related to the uniform guidance
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
audit for this year
 
01:43:27.649 --> 01:43:27.659 align:start position:0%
of the 32 reportable findings are in our
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%

01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
24 of those findings are considered
 
01:43:35.090 --> 01:43:35.100 align:start position:0%

01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
non-compliance
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
of which six of those related to the
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
reporting compliance audit area five
 
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
related to sub-recipient monitoring and
 
01:43:57.410 --> 01:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
five related to special tests
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
the good news for of these 24 findings
 
01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:02.100 align:start position:0%
none related to allowability or
 
01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:03.649 align:start position:0%

01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
I do want to point out that 10 of the 24
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
material non-compliance findings are
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
within three programs
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
I know one of them you've already noted
 
01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
today which is LIHEAP also TANF and then
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
the small business credit initiative

01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
of the 32 findings reported 13 of them
 
01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
of the 32 programs three this year had
 
01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:36.179 align:start position:0%
question cost
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
special education finding cluster had a
 
01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:41.580 align:start position:0%

performance in the amount of 124
 
01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars TANF had a special
 
01:44:48.770 --> 01:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
reporting compliance finding resulted in
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
question costs of just 222.
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
which did not rise to a material
 
01:44:55.609 --> 01:44:55.619 align:start position:0%
non-compliance and then TANF had a
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
question cost in the amount of Thirteen
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred thirty I just
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to draw the question cost to your
 
01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:02.930 align:start position:0%
wanted to draw the question cost to your
attention

01:45:02.930 --> 01:45:02.940 align:start position:0%

01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
based on the results of our audit
 
01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
procedures performed we are required to
 
01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
provide an opinion related to the
 
01:45:11.450 --> 01:45:11.460 align:start position:0%

an unmodified or clean opinion was

issued over six of your programs and the

good news here the story to tell is
 
01:45:43.310 --> 01:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
those were some of your largest new

modified opinions
 
01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
um I mean the unqualified opinions
 
01:46:09.770 --> 01:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
unmodified opinions seven of those
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
also received unmodified opinions in

year
 
01:46:17.629 --> 01:46:17.639 align:start position:0%
those would have included so those fine
 
01:46:19.310 --> 01:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
they were qualified last year they're
 
01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
qualified this year the seven programs
 
01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:24.780 align:start position:0%

of the 13 programs that received
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
modified funding 10 of them had covet
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
funding as well
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
the findings themselves begin on page F4
 
01:46:44.689 --> 01:46:44.699 align:start position:0%
of the report the first finding relates
 
01:46:47.330 --> 01:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
to our financial statement audit we had
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
I had previously presented the results
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
of those findings as it related to
 
01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation trust fund in
 
01:46:56.090 --> 01:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
our presentation earlier in this year
 
01:46:57.770 --> 01:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
for each of the findings included in the
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
report management is required to provide
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
a response to the findings which is also
 
01:47:03.890 --> 01:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
included at the bottom of each of the
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
findings as well as their corrective
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
action plan to resolve the matter
 
01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
the corrective action plans are
 
01:47:10.970 --> 01:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
presented to contain within the report
 
01:47:13.250 --> 01:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
as outlined in our opinion the state is
 
01:47:15.050 --> 01:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
responsible for preparing the corrective
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
action plans and the state's responses
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
were not subject to our audit
 
01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
and as such we do not express an opinion
 
01:47:23.689 --> 01:47:23.699 align:start position:0%
as it relates to those corrective action
 
01:47:23.699 --> 01:47:25.970 align:start position:0%
as it relates to those corrective action
plans

01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
plans
 
01:47:27.950 --> 01:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions I know I
 
01:47:29.450 --> 01:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
covered a lot but I know that you had
 
01:47:32.450 --> 01:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
detailed knowledge of the report
 
01:47:34.609 --> 01:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
this is a Monumental effort how many
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
Auditors were involved
 
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
my team we consist of approximately 40
 
01:47:44.810 --> 01:47:44.820 align:start position:0%
professionals between it and CPE CPA
 
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
audit professionals as well as LBA staff
 
01:47:50.209 --> 01:47:50.219 align:start position:0%
to assist us I knew it was almost more
 
01:47:55.370 --> 01:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:58.370 --> 01:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
I guess when they dump all this money on
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
us at once it's difficult to figure out
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
where it all has to be reported and how
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's reported some of these things that
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
I read were very difficult to follow all
 
01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
of a sudden you're a you're a
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
pass-through whereas before you were a
 
01:48:15.410 --> 01:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
distributor distributor and now you have
 
01:48:17.090 --> 01:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
all these other things that come up that
 
01:48:20.209 --> 01:48:20.219 align:start position:0%
you know and and you failed up and and
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
looking for disbarment on someone that
 
01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:23.390 align:start position:0%
looking for disbarment on someone that
you're

01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
passing things to what if they're not a
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
lawyer can they still be disbarred
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
I mean I read these in several places
 
01:48:32.209 --> 01:48:32.219 align:start position:0%
and wondered
 
01:48:34.490 --> 01:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
this is a person that doesn't do any law
 
01:48:37.250 --> 01:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
work why would they be dispared so
 
01:48:40.370 --> 01:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
is that a term used in other areas as
 
01:48:42.530 --> 01:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
well as law yes it is so the federal
 
01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
government has deemed that entity
 
01:48:48.050 --> 01:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
um that not-for-profit as having not
 
01:48:49.490 --> 01:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
reputable and should not be receiving
 
01:48:50.810 --> 01:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
01:48:52.850 --> 01:48:52.860 align:start position:0%
so that's what I I assume just Barman
 
01:48:55.609 --> 01:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
was a wider net than what I originally
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
assumed yeah so appreciate all this
 
01:49:00.290 --> 01:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
information obviously it's been
 
01:49:03.050 --> 01:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
difficult every year there's summary
 
01:49:05.629 --> 01:49:05.639 align:start position:0%
page is appreciated that tells us what's
 
01:49:07.850 --> 01:49:07.860 align:start position:0%
going on in previous years so it's it's
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
not an easy task when they especially
 
01:49:12.169 --> 01:49:12.179 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that gets dumped and
 
01:49:14.689 --> 01:49:14.699 align:start position:0%
I don't think we get much warning and
 
01:49:16.490 --> 01:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
then there's a whole new set of rules so
 
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
the groups have done pretty well
 
01:49:23.050 --> 01:49:23.060 align:start position:0%
considering all these problems that have
 
01:49:25.850 --> 01:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
suddenly you get a bunch of new money
 
01:49:27.530 --> 01:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
and it's got to be dispersed right away
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
and you've got to report right away and
 
01:49:32.330 --> 01:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
we're short of people so and you have to
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
set up the policies and procedures in
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
accordance with compliance and so that's
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
really a story to tell that management
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
those were clean opinions over those
 
01:49:41.390 --> 01:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
programs that management really put in
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
the level of effort necessary because if
 
01:49:45.410 --> 01:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
you look at your bulk of your findings
 
01:49:48.530 --> 01:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
or over the long-term existing programs
 
01:49:51.530 --> 01:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
the Mr chair if I if I may uh Dana call
 
01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
State Comptroller I do just want to
 
01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:54.350 align:start position:0%
State Comptroller I do just want to
recognize

01:49:54.350 --> 01:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
um all of the finance staff that in
 
01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
addition to the programmatic
 
01:50:00.169 --> 01:50:00.179 align:start position:0%
responsibilities uh the finance staff at
 
01:50:02.090 --> 01:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
these agencies many of which did not get
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
additional resources that came with
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
these funds
 
01:50:08.209 --> 01:50:08.219 align:start position:0%
um as you look through the actual FIFA
 
01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:10.639 align:start position:0%
spend expenditures you can see that
 
01:50:13.850 --> 01:50:13.860 align:start position:0%
covid-19 money that is highlighted in
 
01:50:15.890 --> 01:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
each category some of which has been
 
01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
infused in additional already existing
 
01:50:21.530 --> 01:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
programs but they got an influx of
 
01:50:24.169 --> 01:50:24.179 align:start position:0%
additional funding perhaps with no
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
additional resources to manage those
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
funds so I do want to recognize the
 
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
agency staff as well as my staff led by
 
01:50:34.129 --> 01:50:34.139 align:start position:0%
Steve juvenile who has been preparing
 
01:50:36.290 --> 01:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
this Monumental book for several years
 
01:50:39.709 --> 01:50:39.719 align:start position:0%
and after his stint with gopher came
 
01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
back to us and was able to pick right up
 
01:50:45.290 --> 01:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
and and we're really pleased that the
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
findings have maintained at a reasonable
 
01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
level that we think we can manage going
 
01:50:52.250 --> 01:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
forward so
 
01:50:55.609 --> 01:50:55.619 align:start position:0%
thank you very great
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
um my concern is the repeating items uh
 
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
not only on this side audit but other
 
01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
Audits and and I haven't been able to
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
pin anybody down uh whether it's
 
01:51:08.330 --> 01:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
administrative services or somewhere
 
01:51:11.570 --> 01:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
else uh that needs to be the one that
 
01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
tracks these things and looks at them
 
01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
current status Etc you know plan of
 
01:51:19.790 --> 01:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
action Milestones uh those kind of
 
01:51:23.149 --> 01:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
things because we shouldn't have all the
 
01:51:25.010 --> 01:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
repeating items that we've had in the
 
01:51:28.189 --> 01:51:28.199 align:start position:0%
last few months so thank you
 
01:51:30.770 --> 01:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the comment excuse me
 
01:51:31.970 --> 01:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
and we do
 
01:51:34.490 --> 01:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
um we have administrative Services have
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
a corrective Action Report filing status
 
01:51:39.169 --> 01:51:39.179 align:start position:0%
program that we work with each
 
01:51:42.770 --> 01:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
commissioner to engage them in in really
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
following up quarterly on these findings
 
01:51:46.970 --> 01:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
we did have some slippage in that
 
01:51:49.850 --> 01:51:49.860 align:start position:0%
because of the movement with our staff
 
01:51:51.770 --> 01:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
over to gopher and and now we're going
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
to pick that back up so I do think it
 
01:51:56.450 --> 01:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
falls on both equally it falls on
 
01:51:58.669 --> 01:51:58.679 align:start position:0%
administrative services to Monitor and

date of the next meeting
 
01:53:41.209 --> 01:53:41.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:44.450 --> 01:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
we will have a session on the 18th so
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh we will have finished up a lot of the
 
01:53:48.890 --> 01:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
stuff in the in the house how about the
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
Senate any more convenient time
 
01:53:58.490 --> 01:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
the Fallen law enforcement offers
 
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
service memorial service he said on the
 
01:54:08.090 --> 01:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
19th is the 19th at 10 A.M
 
01:54:10.850 --> 01:54:10.860 align:start position:0%
same time we'd be starting
 
01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:14.390 align:start position:0%
same time we'd be starting
yeah

01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:16.970 --> 01:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
that's happened to double types what
 
01:54:20.689 --> 01:54:20.699 align:start position:0%
happened has it hasn't interfered
 
01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
unless it might be hard to find your way
 
01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
into the parking garage but can I ask
 
01:54:30.609 --> 01:54:30.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:33.290 --> 01:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
that would have done it yeah and the
 
01:54:35.209 --> 01:54:35.219 align:start position:0%
idea is try to move things is
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
problematic because of other things so
 
01:54:39.290 --> 01:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
that's right as you have other things
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:54:42.410 --> 01:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
I have a question for the committee it
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
seems somewhere along the line we
 
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
switched from being the second
 
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
Friday to being the third Friday and the
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
third Friday has traditionally been our
 
01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
executive committee meeting in the
 
01:54:54.890 --> 01:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
county which I've not been able to go to
 
01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:55.850 align:start position:0%
county which I've not been able to go to
for

01:54:55.850 --> 01:54:55.860 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:54:58.669 --> 01:54:58.679 align:start position:0%
a while now
 
01:55:00.410 --> 01:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if you've got a
 
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
problem does
 
01:55:06.850 --> 01:55:06.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:08.930 --> 01:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
well something definitely changed
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
because on the on the second it may be
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
all right maybe you're correct but on
 
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
the second Friday I have the judicial
 
01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
retirement medium that hasn't changed in
 
01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
fact I had them move it until later in
 
01:55:20.090 --> 01:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
the afternoon so that I could go to do
 
01:55:22.010 --> 01:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
this in the morning I
 
01:55:23.629 --> 01:55:23.639 align:start position:0%
if it's possible change would be great
 
01:55:24.770 --> 01:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
if not I'll just deal with it I'll just
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
tell them if would you be done with your
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
meeting in in the by noon time yes
 
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
so on the second on the second Friday
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
though I believe on the 19th there's
 
01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
already meeting scheduled for yeah in
 
01:55:43.370 --> 01:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
the afternoon Health and Human Services
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
oversight committee is in the afternoon
 
01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
this is why I brought up the second
 
01:55:48.350 --> 01:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
Friday I was hoping the second Friday
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
would have worked better for people
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
would that be the 12th what do you what
 
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
do you have on the second Friday the
 
01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:54.950 align:start position:0%
do you have on the second Friday the
12th

01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
12th
 
01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:57.350 align:start position:0%
12th
questions

01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:55:57.360 --> 01:55:59.629 align:start position:0%
questions
nothing

01:55:59.629 --> 01:55:59.639 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:56:04.330 --> 01:56:04.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:07.010 --> 01:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
in the third too that that's the fourth
 
01:56:08.930 --> 01:56:08.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I said the fourth
 
01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:13.790 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I said the fourth
nice

01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
to be the fourth okay the fourth
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
the executive committee's being the
 
01:56:19.199 --> 01:56:20.450 align:start position:0%
the executive committee's being the
fourth

01:56:20.450 --> 01:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
fourth
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:27.709 --> 01:56:27.719 align:start position:0%
it's today
 
01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:38.209 --> 01:56:38.219 align:start position:0%
so the Hillsborough County is not on the
 
01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
19th okay I guess not
 
01:56:42.290 --> 01:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
no it is on the 19th apparently no no
 
01:56:44.330 --> 01:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
26th I don't believe you because I've
 
01:56:45.890 --> 01:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
missed it like three times because of
 
01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:48.970 align:start position:0%
missed it like three times because of
this

01:56:48.970 --> 01:56:48.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:51.590 --> 01:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
all right so that's not a that's not a
 
01:56:56.330 --> 01:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:59.350 --> 01:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
all right let's make it 10 a.m on
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
on May 19th
 
01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
or fiscal
 
01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:06.050 align:start position:0%
or fiscal
um

01:57:06.050 --> 01:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:09.590 --> 01:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
any any idea Mr Kane will there be a lot
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
of items or are there any uh Mr Smith
 
01:57:15.050 --> 01:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
will be bringing in several audits or
 
01:57:19.070 --> 01:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:21.050 --> 01:57:21.060 align:start position:0%
one at the most okay
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
you'll start to pick up on the number of
 
01:57:26.209 --> 01:57:26.219 align:start position:0%
items due to the end of the year so um
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
you're probably still anybody's guess
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's a little heavier than this I would
 
01:57:31.490 --> 01:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
guess in the 40 item range for the next
 
01:57:32.810 --> 01:57:32.820 align:start position:0%
couple months
 
01:57:35.209 --> 01:57:35.219 align:start position:0%
so but we were successful on covering
 
01:57:37.370 --> 01:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
most of them on a on a consent calendar
 
01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:38.450 align:start position:0%
most of them on a on a consent calendar
so

01:57:38.450 --> 01:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:41.870 --> 01:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:57:46.129 --> 01:57:46.139 align:start position:0%
May 19th 10 o'clock next meeting
 
01:57:48.169 --> 01:57:48.179 align:start position:0%
anything further
 
01:57:52.010 --> 01:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
committee is adjourned
 
01:57:56.770 --> 01:57:56.780 align:start position:0%
thank you all for coming
 
01:58:02.570 --> 01:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
