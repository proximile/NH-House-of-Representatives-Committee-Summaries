spill I I I have it I just good morning
 
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and the rest of the
 
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
committee Mark PR Hillsboro 15
 
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
introducing a bill
 
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
that just starting to read now so
 
00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 align:start position:0%
apparently this says that uh
 
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities can give out permits for
 
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.509 align:start position:0%
municipalities can give out permits for
fireworks

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 align:start position:0%
fireworks
 
00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 align:start position:0%
display and that the fire department
 
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
will have the ability to inspect the
 
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
site and the fire chief will get to
 
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
determine whether fire apparatus and
 
00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
Personnel need to be there in case of an
 
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
emergency and they determine how long
 
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
there thank you representative I'm
 
00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 align:start position:0%
assuming that you probably aren't the
 
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
best person to ask questions you would
 
00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
assume correctly but I imagine I could
 
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
get through a little bit see so would
 
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
everybody be okay if we just give
 
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
representative PR a second to look over
 
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 align:start position:0%
this because he would be our expert in
 
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
the room when it when it comes to this
 
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
we might be able to so usually most
 
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
firework displays need to have fire
 
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
personnel there but I and I'm not sure
 
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
if this is going more towards the
 
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
private person looking to do something
 
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
in their backyard as opposed to a
 
00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
municipality putting on the Fourth of
 
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
July fireworks so I'm not really sure
 
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
but in the question of should there be
 
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
fire apparatus there with Personnel
 
00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
depending on how big the display is and
 
00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
how big the fireworks they are using
 
00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
what class they are uh you definitely
 
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
want somebody there when they go
 
00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
bad and they do go bad from time to
 
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
time me V to
 
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
allower and so that are you reading this
 
00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
that it would that it would be that it
 
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
would go on the ballot for the voting
 
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
body to decide that whether to give
 
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
permits or not yeah so so the towns as
 
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
far as I understand it towns right now
 
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
have the ability to say yes we're GNA
 
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
have fireworks in our town and allow
 
00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
them or no we're not right and that's
 
00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 align:start position:0%
for I believe for the private
 
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
user again I'm just kind of winging this
 
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
as we go yeah that that's okay I think
 
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
we are we appreciate
 
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.189 align:start position:0%
we are we appreciate
you

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
so give me a second I want to does
 
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
anybody does anybody have any questions
 
00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
just looking at this that or any input
 
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
that they would like to
 
00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
Newman even Mike even though they choose
 
00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 align:start position:0%
to have the presence there they might
 
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
not not they might allow for the
 
00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
fireworks and have the presence there is
 
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
that that might be so the to as I read
 
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
this the town can say yes you can have
 
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
fireworks right the fire chief will be
 
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to come look at that site to see
 
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
what you're actually using for fireworks
 
00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
because there are different
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
classes basically from small to big
 
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
commercial um and he gets to decide
 
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
whether fire apparatus and Personnel
 
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
there and how long they need to be there
 
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
CU even after you're done shooting off
 
00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
the fireworks if some of them haven't
 
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
gone off you have to wait till they cool
 
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
down a certain amount of time and then
 
00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
you can uh make Rend of them
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
safe thank
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
you all right oh representative Murray
 
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Murphy representative Murphy
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
close enough thank you um thank you
 
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
representative proof for taking my
 
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.070 align:start position:0%
representative proof for taking my
question

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
um in do you know now if do fire um
 
00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
Chiefs not have the ability to determine
 
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
whether uh to to inspect the site and
 
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not they so I
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
believe when it comes to private home
 
00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
fireworks yeah no if it's a
 
00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
commercial uh shoot with the
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
professionals doing it uhcl uh using
 
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
commercial fireworks we are required to
 
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.950 align:start position:0%
commercial fireworks we are required to
be

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
there we are required to inspect
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
it follow up thank you so this is likely
 
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 align:start position:0%

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 align:start position:0%

the rest of the committee my name is
 
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
Philip Byron I am a deputy fire marshal
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
for the office of State Fire Marshal um
 
00:08:11.869 --> 00:08:11.879 align:start position:0%
we are in neutral of this bill um our
 
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
office is okay with making a change from
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
the current administrative rules to
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
provide the local fire chief with
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility around the scheduling of the
 
00:08:22.029 --> 00:08:22.039 align:start position:0%
fire details our interest is that an
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
inspection is completed and it makes
 
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
sense to have resources available at the
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
time of display current administrative r
 
00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:31.479 align:start position:0%
R says the detail is on site from their
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
time of arrival to completion of the
 
00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:36.039 align:start position:0%
display any
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
questions yes so
 
00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
that what you just said is for a munici
 
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
like a
 
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
municipality that is setting off
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
professional fireworks this is for I
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
want to put off fireworks in my backyard
 
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
because it's Fourth of July so according
 
00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
to the verbiage it does say sight of a
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
display show or sight of the display so
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
that typically Ally means your
 
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
1.3 larger shows that cons uh the
 
00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
companies put on not your typical home
 
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:11.720 align:start position:0%
shows so if you want to shoot something
 
00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
in your backyard you go to a fireworks
 
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
store you'll buy the one point4 consumer
 
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
product that is not the intent from what
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
I understand of this bill this is more
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:25.240 align:start position:0%
display and it gives the fire department
 
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
the option of when to arrive and it it
 
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
if I may
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
so I was understanding from
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative PR that they already have
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
to be present that's correct safy this
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
is given them the option of whether they
 
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
have to stay there the whole time I
 
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
understand thank you it gives them more
 
00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
flexibility safc 5024 do10 is fire
 
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
equipment that is under the display
 
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
fireworks rules which dis that discusses
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
and outlines the requirement for
 
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
firework detail at this time
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
okay so just you got everything I
 
00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:06.279 align:start position:0%
said pretty much I think you got the
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
time period right I think you did you
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
did such a good job representative PR
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
we're so proud of you representative
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
Murphy oh thank you thanks for taking my
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for your help
 
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.030 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for your help
around

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
this yeah um can you tell me the the
 
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
language is a sight of the display I
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
heard what you just said um and I I I'm
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
just wondering if that could be
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
if a citizen could just say well this is
 
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
the site where my display is going to be
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
if if that language needs to be more
 
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
specific to around to distinguish
 
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
whether the fire department has to show
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
up at a local local residence
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
wait wait yeah so local res residences
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
so like representative was mentioning
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
the local authorities do have ordinances
 
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
in place in their communities to allow
 
00:10:59.470 --> 00:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
or disallow fireworks
 
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.629 align:start position:0%
or disallow fireworks
for

00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
anyone um when it comes to local
 
00:11:07.949 --> 00:11:07.959 align:start position:0%
homeowners they're able to the local
 
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
municipality allows it to utilize
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
fireworks a firework detail would not be
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
required for that for personal use if it
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
was a display show or anyone doing
 
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
anything larger than that where the
 
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:22.519 align:start position:0%
Public's involved things like that
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
that's where a detto may come into place
 
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
representativ do you have anything to
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
add that might help us out here just any
 
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
questions because it seemed like you you
 
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
knew but you were over there being so
 
00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
quiet okay uh representative
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
Muse I I do have a question I know we
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
have a we have a neighbor that about two
 
00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:50.839 align:start position:0%
or three times a year uh puts on a show
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
that uh in some years almost puts the
 
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth uh City fireworks display to
 
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
shame um it will go on for over a half
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
an hour
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
um most of the same stuff pretty much
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
everything you would see in the
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth display which is a pretty
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
good one uh uh you'll see from uh from
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
the the dock over and back of our
 
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.670 align:start position:0%
the the dock over and back of our
property

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
um how do you know I mean what what what
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
sort of where's the where does is there
 
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
a line between what's acceptable for a
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
private homeowner and these public
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
display requirements that are more
 
00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:30.279 align:start position:0%
commercially oriented said when the
 
00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
homeowner is putting on a display that's
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much at the level of Comm a
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
commercial display so yes it's the te
 
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
technology these days is very difficult
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
to distinguish between a display show
 
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
and consumer show because a consumer
 
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
product is so welldeveloped now that it
 
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
looks like a display show so that maybe
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
is what you're seeing at in your
 
00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
location um it it does happen quite
 
00:13:04.189 --> 00:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
state and what would and what would the
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
impact of this bill be if any on that
 
00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
type of
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
display nothing this is this is more for
 
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
display shoot so a company comes in like
 
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
Port Smith and they uh they have a
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
company set up to do a shoot for a
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
public event then a firework detail
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
would follow this law and they do with
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
this bill they do that anyway right so
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome sounds
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%

and there's been core cases since then
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
um to deal with the fact that their 14th
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh rights were violated so
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
what this addresses is the the pro the
 
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
problem of lack of due process with
 
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
regards to this uh section of law um we
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
have a 14th Amendment right which
 
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
establishes that people require due
 
01:13:58.629 --> 01:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
process when they are given uh orders no
 
01:13:58.639 --> 01:13:59.870 align:start position:0%
process when they are given uh orders no
trespass

01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
trespass
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
orders and it is also in our New
 
01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:03.870 align:start position:0%
orders and it is also in our New
Hampshire

01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution um requiring a process of
 
01:14:12.189 --> 01:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
uh due process uh when they have these
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
issues uh these orders issued so I give
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
you the um inside
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
sources print out here and on the back
 
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see the actual um no trespass
 
01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:25.950 align:start position:0%
you'll see the actual um no trespass
order

01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
um your review the problem is with these
 
01:14:37.149 --> 01:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
and many others in New Hampshire um is
 
01:14:40.669 --> 01:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
that they lack any sort of
 
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
um uh notice to the plaintiff if you
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
will um of that they can
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
um appeal this
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
judgment um so this is what uh this
 
01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
spill seeks to
 
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
remedy is the appeal process and also
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
setting into place um more rigid
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
requirements and
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
specificity uh the second thing in the
 
01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
packet is a uh print out about gen in
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
general about no trespass orders by the
 
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
ACLU um I believe Massachusetts has had
 
01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
quite a few cases regarding this um
 
01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.110 align:start position:0%
quite a few cases regarding this um
issue

01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
and if you do a little bit of research
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
you'll find that all states have some
 
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
sort of due process when it comes to no
 
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
no trespass orders on public property or
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
on any property for that matter
 
01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
um and then the third thing here is a
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
specific case in New
 
01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you see a ACLU and your
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
packet um it is a specific case
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
regarding uh plane Jeffrey Pendleton
 
01:15:59.629 --> 01:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
from 2014 he was a homeless
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
person um that was outside of a
 
01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.229 align:start position:0%
person um that was outside of a
Nashville

01:16:05.229 --> 01:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
Nashville
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
library um he was given a no a verbal no
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
trespass order without any sort of
 
01:16:15.390 --> 01:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
indate or um appeal process offered to
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
him um and
 
01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
so he
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
actually ended up being in jail for 33
 
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
days um because of it but the case found
 
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
that his rights were violated um
 
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
specifically the 14th the US uh 14th
 
01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment um and also um our statute
 
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
also um requires that they have due
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
process so if you flip to page8 and N
 
01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
where I have it sectioned off of a pink
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
note um
 
01:16:56.669 --> 01:16:56.679 align:start position:0%
down on page eight second and third pray
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh where it says second and
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
third those are the
 
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
um findings that pertain to this bill
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
here um the department the police
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
department provided no meaningful
 
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for Mr Pendleton to contest
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
the removal of his
 
01:17:14.239 --> 01:17:15.830 align:start position:0%
the removal of his
rights

01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
um and it's citing some other cases and
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
then third the no trespass order was
 
01:17:23.629 --> 01:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
issued without any narrow objective
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
standards or criteria regarding when the
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
issuance um of the no trespass order is
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate and what its scope or
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
duration should be so a lot of these
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
orders I'm hearing are they're coming
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
down they have no end
 
01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
date um they're not specific they're not
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
narrow in the case of uh the bow the the
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
case in Bow if you read about it um the
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
parent in question here was prohibited
 
01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
from entering buildings ground even the
 
01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:53.830 align:start position:0%
from entering buildings ground even the
parking

01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
parking
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
lot F Fields until further notice no end
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
date no appeal process
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um now we can fix this and
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
stop some of these prevent some of these
 
01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuits from coming through it's just
 
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um I'm giving you you also
 
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
see a no trespassing order this is from
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
the uh town of
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
molteno but there's dozens people have
 
01:18:25.229 --> 01:18:25.239 align:start position:0%
sent me dozens of these from
 
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities they're all the
 
01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
same it's
 
01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
just name of unwanted person here's the
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
order this order will remain into effect
 
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
until you receive written permission
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah no uh no appeal process
 
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
at all no
 
01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.750 align:start position:0%
at all no
hearing

01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
um and a couple other
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
things um this is uh it says Northampton
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's Massachusetts this is not really
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
pertaining to the bill directly but it's
 
01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
an example of how after multiple um sort
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
of constitutional cases in St
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that were regarding this s
 
01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
same subject a school district has taken
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
upon themselves to uh craft a very
 
01:19:18.910 --> 01:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
specific policy that would protect
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
people's constitutional rights with
 
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
regard to issuance of no trespass orders
 
01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:25.470 align:start position:0%
regard to issuance of no trespass orders
um

01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
they have according to this policy the
 
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
school system must exhaust efforts to
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
resolve the issues it's a temporary
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
order with specific um time limits Etc
 
01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:41.560 align:start position:0%
so it's just um this is just for your
 
01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
um understanding of the whole issue
 
01:19:50.110 --> 01:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
might not be particular to this case
 
01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
here um and so
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
that is uh pretty much it is just I'm
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
C so this bill is being
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
um was given to me by the school
 
01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:15.430 align:start position:0%
um was given to me by the school
governance

01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
governance
 
01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
Association um and what it it uh
 
01:20:18.159 --> 01:20:19.229 align:start position:0%
Association um and what it it uh
provides

01:20:19.229 --> 01:20:19.239 align:start position:0%
provides
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
for is that until an order is um issued
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
the unanimous vote of a g governing body
 
01:20:31.229 --> 01:20:31.239 align:start position:0%
in a duly notice public meeting shall
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
take place uh so the
 
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
person subject to the order shall have
 
01:20:37.229 --> 01:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
the right to the hearing with the
 
01:20:39.790 --> 01:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
governing body in a non-public or public
 
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
section session and um shall shall be uh
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
before such a a vote by the governing
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
body um and then there's a process for
 
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
further appealing if need be now I I
 
01:20:55.629 --> 01:20:55.639 align:start position:0%
realize that there's probably people
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
here uh from libraries and whatnot I
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
know libraries across our
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
state they use these blanket no trespass
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
orders quite frequently for um unhoused
 
01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
people and whatnot that end up in their
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
libraries um but I would contend that
 
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
there still should be a process in place
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
there should be due process in our
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
statute um to provide
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
for everybody
 
01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:29.560 align:start position:0%
who is on public property and
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
and might have this sort of order that
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh comes
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
down so um with that I'll take any
 
01:21:41.950 --> 01:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um I wonder if if
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's not possible to to do both so I see
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
in the bill it says that it may not
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
issue until there's been a unanimous
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
vote of the governing body um which in
 
01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
itself is a very high bar because you
 
01:21:55.870 --> 01:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
may have some someone who just refuses
 
01:21:58.270 --> 01:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
to ever get vote for one of these and
 
01:22:00.189 --> 01:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
the agency may never get an own trespass
 
01:22:03.149 --> 01:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
order so that's that's one thing but put
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
a pin in that what about the time it
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
takes for the governing body to convene
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
and get one of these orders issued
 
01:22:11.950 --> 01:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have people that are very
 
01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
disruptive and maybe even dangerous for
 
01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
example at a library you could have
 
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
someone who's in their emotionally
 
01:22:19.709 --> 01:22:19.719 align:start position:0%
disturbed person you know children are
 
01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
there would it not be possible to for
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
them to be able to um issue one on an
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
emergency basis and then have to have it
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
only good until the next meeting where
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
then they could go over it and vote on
 
01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
it and then still leave the the appeal
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
process in in place that way they could
 
01:22:39.629 --> 01:22:39.639 align:start position:0%
deal with somebody who was causing a
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
problem right away but that person would
 
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
still have their ability for due process
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts about that thank
 
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um yes I I think that's how
 
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
it's done in some states of doing a
 
01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
little research and I I asked OS to kind
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
of of uh weigh in on this as well I
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
asked told OLS is possible that U
 
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
amendment is coming forward um to sort
 
01:23:08.430 --> 01:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
of address maybe a temporary um no
 
01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
trespassing order and then the have the
 
01:23:13.950 --> 01:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
the hearing process go forward and and
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
then also there's there's an issue of
 
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
should it be unanimous or should it be a
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
majority yeah um I would be friendly to
 
01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
any sort of discussion in that regard we
 
01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
work on the bill whatever the committee
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
decides okay great that's good because
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that high bar if you get
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
you could have one person who just hates
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
no trespass orders and the agency would
 
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
just be unable to ever do anything um
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
and you are meable to possibly um having
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
an emergency procedure thank you uh
 
01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee uh
 
01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:44.709 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee uh
representative

01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:48.280 align:start position:0%
Sher okay uh first I I agree with the
 
01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
the chair's comments I think that's
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
having a a temporary emergency process
 
01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
uh with a finite and at the until the
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
the whoever the governing body is can
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
meet I I think that's a great idea and I
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
would be in favor also of a a majority
 
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
vote the question I have is tangentially
 
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
related um is Jeffrey Pendleton if I
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
understand if I remember correctly
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
Jeffrey P Pendleton died in jail that
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
correct um I it's said that he served
 
01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:21.390 align:start position:0%
correct um I it's said that he served
his

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
his
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
sentence I I didn't see anything about
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
that here I'll check on that irrelevant
 
01:24:28.709 --> 01:24:28.719 align:start position:0%
to this but I'm just curious there's
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
some other cases in here in the back too
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
that I think pertain to NASA
 
01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
but okay yeah sorry representative
 
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
n thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I I you know
 
01:24:45.629 --> 01:24:45.639 align:start position:0%
clearly um there isn't a fiscal note
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
attached to this because it wouldn't be
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
an expense to the state but I think it
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
would be an ex uh an expense to um
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
notice and to have you know having a a
 
01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
public meeting requires certain things
 
01:24:59.229 --> 01:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
uh for a town or a municipality um and
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
employing people streaming it having it
 
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
public things like that um have you
 
01:25:05.149 --> 01:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
given any thought or do you have any
 
01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
numbers for as far as what this would
 
01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
cost the
 
01:25:11.229 --> 01:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
municipality uh thank you for your
 
01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
question representative n um that would
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
be sort of up to the committee as far as
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
time frames so if the committee decides
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
that they should have a
 
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
hearing at at a date certain after the
 
01:25:29.629 --> 01:25:29.639 align:start position:0%
order or at the next um scheduled
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
meeting so for instance somebody gets an
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
order no trespassing
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
order the law can simply read you know
 
01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
at the next scheduled hearing or within
 
01:25:45.629 --> 01:25:45.639 align:start position:0%
10 days the subject shall be granted a
 
01:25:47.790 --> 01:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
hearing I don't think it would cost
 
01:25:50.350 --> 01:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
anything extra because you still have to
 
01:25:53.790 --> 01:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
notice for those meetings anyway so
 
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
given that they meet maybe once a month
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
or twice a month I don't see that as
 
01:26:03.310 --> 01:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
unreasonable um but um no I have not uh
 
01:26:05.229 --> 01:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
flushed out any costs if that's what you
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
mean can I follow up okay um because it
 
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
seems to me like the the process is laid
 
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
out here and one of the things that is
 
01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
laid out is um having a um public or
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
non-public at the election of the person
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
um having um a meeting with the
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
governing body in advance of that public
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
meeting so that is in addition uh to
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
what would happen and it does need to be
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
duly noticed um I would assume for that
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
purpose as well um so that the public
 
01:26:34.510 --> 01:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
could be ready for it but what I am
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
saying is that it I don't think that all
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
of these things fit under um under the
 
01:26:41.709 --> 01:26:41.719 align:start position:0%
scope of of what would already be
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
happening so it would already be an
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
expense to you
 
01:26:49.390 --> 01:26:49.400 align:start position:0%
agree um I don't think it would um I I
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
think it's it depends on the
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
municipality how they want to handle it
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
I guess it could be extremely expensive
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
if you had hours and hours worth of uh
 
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
attorney fees however it is the 14th
 
01:27:03.669 --> 01:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment we're talking about so I don't
 
01:27:06.189 --> 01:27:06.199 align:start position:0%
really see it's a federal requirement
 
01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:08.199 align:start position:0%
within our constitution to have due
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
process so I don't really know how
 
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
there's any getting around
 
01:27:15.109 --> 01:27:15.119 align:start position:0%
it okay yeah and also appealing to the
 
01:27:17.470 --> 01:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
supre court I'm sure that would be a
 
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
right and and this this measure I mean
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a cost-saving
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
measure if nothing else I I hope um for
 
01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
the municipalities it's a simple thing
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh to provide for due process and it it
 
01:27:33.229 --> 01:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be
 
01:27:36.109 --> 01:27:36.119 align:start position:0%
costly um I don't think lawyers need to
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
be involved but lawyers could be
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
involved and that I guess that's all I
 
01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
can say to say about that thank you
 
01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:45.990 align:start position:0%
can say to say about that thank you
thank

01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
sh yes thank you for taking my question
 
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
uh I'm somewhat t tangentially aware of
 
01:27:59.470 --> 01:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
the bow case and it seems to me that
 
01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
this issue of slapping a no trespassing
 
01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
order on a person who was in my mind
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
exercising Free Speech was a
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
terrific uh
 
01:28:20.189 --> 01:28:20.199 align:start position:0%
overreach with respect to the uh Power
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
of the individual who put on the no
 
01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
trespass or order um are there
 
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
any provisions in the bill that would
 
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
keep somebody from putting on a no
 
01:28:36.669 --> 01:28:36.679 align:start position:0%
trespass order when
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
Speech oh I thank you uh representative
 
01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
I think I know what you're talking about
 
01:28:51.550 --> 01:28:51.560 align:start position:0%
is can't should we or it do this doesn't
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
provide specifically for free speech
 
01:28:54.639 --> 01:28:55.990 align:start position:0%
provide specifically for free speech
there's

01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
no there's nothing in this in particular
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
about it um from what I see from other
 
01:29:04.109 --> 01:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
states and I've tried to do a little
 
01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:07.400 align:start position:0%
research it's not particularly fleshed
 
01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
out in other states precise Provisions I
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
think it may it's possible that some of
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
these Provisions are in um chaptered law
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
or maybe it just says due process and
 
01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
then it's up to the type of municipality
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
because a school board so that's why I I
 
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
handed out that um one sheet from the uh
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
new Hamp Northampton school they had
 
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
already you know suffered through a
 
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuit so they figured that they would
 
01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
protect themselves in the future and
 
01:29:44.350 --> 01:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
some of these um there's also another
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
one in here from Vermont and it's giv a
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of guidance in other words the
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
school guidance is different from a
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
library guidance different from the town
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
hall um and other privileged meanss
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
because there's some functions of the
 
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
government or public property for
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
instance where you don't have the public
 
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
on there like at a
 
01:30:11.229 --> 01:30:11.239 align:start position:0%
um you Department of Transportation you
 
01:30:14.189 --> 01:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
know um the public isn't it's a public
 
01:30:17.709 --> 01:30:17.719 align:start position:0%
property but it's really not um a place
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
like a school where you have rights so
 
01:30:21.709 --> 01:30:21.719 align:start position:0%
in other words the parents have a right
 
01:30:23.189 --> 01:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
to be heard the parents have a right to
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
go to the uh school board meetings and
 
01:30:28.229 --> 01:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
to participate in their child's
 
01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
schooling um which is why the schools
 
01:30:33.310 --> 01:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
some of the schools have really buttoned
 
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
down on providing a lot of these
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights to their uh to
 
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
this process whereas if you have a
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
Transportation garage it's not going to
 
01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
be the same thing um but yeah I have not
 
01:30:50.709 --> 01:30:50.719 align:start position:0%
um we don't have that in here at this
 
01:30:53.950 --> 01:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
point this is just a a simple sort of in
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
uction to thank you fixing the problem
 
01:30:59.470 --> 01:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
thanks hopefully that
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
helps thank you um any further questions
 
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
yeah representative rhods thank you Mr
 
01:31:06.910 --> 01:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
question representative I just thought
 
01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
of this for a second let's say a person
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
was had received a no trespass order say
 
01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
they went to a school board meeting and
 
01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
didn't go well
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
right and the deliberative
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
session is being is taking place in the
 
01:31:24.590 --> 01:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
school gym
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
would they be allowed to go to that
 
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
deliberative session because it's not a
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
a school event or would they still be
 
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
still be basically banned from going to
 
01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:37.229 align:start position:0%
still be basically banned from going to
the

01:31:37.229 --> 01:31:37.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
building great question um
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
representative roads if you look at the
 
01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
back of the bow order it just says that
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
this subject was prohibited from
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
entering buildings grounds it didn't
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
give any car vs so so um yeah I would
 
01:31:58.590 --> 01:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
think that that that person would be
 
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
arrested again if if at a at a sb2
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
hearing I think that we need to
 
01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
understand that a trespass as regards a
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
property um geographically um we start
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
talking about go to this meeting go to
 
01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
that meeting we're looking at
 
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
restraining orders say you can't be
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
within so many feet of a certain event
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
trespass means property and if we say
 
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
you can't trespass on that property it
 
01:32:24.149 --> 01:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
means period you can't trespass on that
 
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
property you would be able thank you for
 
01:32:28.189 --> 01:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
that clarification
 
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
trespassing well that is correct also
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
you have to understand you start running
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
into Title 18 type questions if if a
 
01:32:37.709 --> 01:32:37.719 align:start position:0%
school deprives someone of their ability
 
01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
to go vote that's on their property
 
01:32:42.189 --> 01:32:42.199 align:start position:0%
they'd be subject to a lawsuit Federal
 
01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuit for violating the person's
 
01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
rights under the color of law so it it
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
becomes quite messy so I think narrowing
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
it to just the what we're doing I think
 
01:32:55.109 --> 01:32:55.119 align:start position:0%
is a good idea any further questions
 
01:32:55.119 --> 01:32:57.430 align:start position:0%
is a good idea any further questions
representative

01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
Newman thank
 
01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
you I just have a question I thought I
 
01:33:03.109 --> 01:33:03.119 align:start position:0%
heard you say just a moment ago
 
01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
something about it wouldn't apply to a
 
01:33:07.229 --> 01:33:07.239 align:start position:0%
department of a transportation garage
 
01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
for example did I mishar that oh thank
 
01:33:14.189 --> 01:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
you for the um question representative
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
um what I I think what I was trying to
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
say if I didn't say it is that it is
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
different depending on the part the type
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
of public property if from what I've
 
01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
read about the different cases is that
 
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
different types of property will have
 
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
different types of privileges for
 
01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
instance there was a case in um I think
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
it's down in Kingston during the
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
co here um during Co when there was a
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
parent who was
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
um uh or actually it was a teacher was
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
thrown out of a meeting uh because she
 
01:33:50.669 --> 01:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
wasn't wearing a mask um but what had
 
01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
happened was the school board had
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
separated and put the parents in a in a
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
different room and they were in a
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
separate room there was some property it
 
01:34:03.629 --> 01:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
was a privileged space so the uh Court
 
01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
found that it was a privileged space
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
where the school board
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
was and um so there's there's a lot of
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
Nu I guess what I'm trying to say is
 
01:34:14.189 --> 01:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of nuance to it depending
 
01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
on the type of public use for instance
 
01:34:19.709 --> 01:34:19.719 align:start position:0%
the um case here in
 
01:34:22.830 --> 01:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
Nashua the the gentleman was outside on
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
the grounds so you would think that that
 
01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
is probably the most liberal use of
 
01:34:31.229 --> 01:34:31.239 align:start position:0%
public property that you could find is
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
somebody walking through public grounds
 
01:34:37.149 --> 01:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
outside and then a Mor on the other end
 
01:34:39.109 --> 01:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
of the spectrum you would have somewhere
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
some some place like a do garage or
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
maybe a medical type building or a
 
01:34:47.709 --> 01:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
privileged type of space where the
 
01:34:50.669 --> 01:34:50.679 align:start position:0%
public is not generally coming through
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
so you have the the spectrum of types of
 
01:34:53.199 --> 01:34:54.470 align:start position:0%
so you have the the spectrum of types of
space

01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
space
 
01:34:57.070 --> 01:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
I guess is what the courts have found
 
01:34:58.830 --> 01:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
that there's there is some play and
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
Nuance in there which is why I didn't
 
01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
want to get into making um the bill just
 
01:35:07.709 --> 01:35:07.719 align:start position:0%
fit one type of thing but just a general
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
circumstance does that help or make
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
sense thank you for that explanation and
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering how in the first
 
01:35:16.109 --> 01:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
sentence where it just says Municipal
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
prop it says Municipal in school
 
01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
district property but if it says um
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
any Municipal property I'm thinking that
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's all inclusive so I'm wondering if
 
01:35:31.950 --> 01:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
there may be a problem there with that
 
01:35:34.350 --> 01:35:34.360 align:start position:0%
in getting the Nuance recognized so that
 
01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
the law could be applied so thank you I
 
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
that represent
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
Muse I just wanted to raise uh one
 
01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
possibility with you too I know um uh
 
01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
School rooms in particular particular
 
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
you know are not necessarily a situation
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
where we want you know just random folks
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
wandering wandering in and out um when
 
01:36:07.229 --> 01:36:07.239 align:start position:0%
we talk about maybe having different
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
different standards for different types
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
of Municipal property and school
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
buildings are that to me would be one uh
 
01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:15.679 align:start position:0%
where you would need to have an
 
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
extremely high bar and also the ability
 
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
um you know to remove anybody from a a
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
child's class room who's being disrupted
 
01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
or really who just shouldn't be there at
 
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
all uh would you agree with that thank
 
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
you representative um yes of course I
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
agree with that we don't want um any
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a anarchistic environment that
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping to enable but just a a due
 
01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
process which is it is part of the
 
01:36:51.149 --> 01:36:51.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution that we provide a due
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
process that is that's all that this
 
01:36:58.109 --> 01:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
Bill seeks to fix um but it wouldn't
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
preclude sort of the situation you're
 
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
talking about where obviously an
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
individual that doesn't belong in a
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
place should be removed um that's that's
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
how that's not going to change how that
 
01:37:14.590 --> 01:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
state so see no further questions thank
 
01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%

District 5 Lon New Hampshire I am simply
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
here to say that the city manager has
 
01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
reached out to me of lonier and has
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
informed me that both he and the uh
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
chief of police feel that this bill as
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
written would be
 
01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
very hard to work
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
with uh with the issues they have in
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
lonia now that's
 
01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you did they give you any more
 
01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
specificity about why it would be hard
 
01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
or just the the way the bill is laid out
 
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
to uh have meetings have uh call a
 
01:38:27.310 --> 01:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
meeting wait for a meeting when we have
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
an issue that they want to deal with
 
01:38:32.589 --> 01:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
right at at that time um okay so I think
 
01:38:34.510 --> 01:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
that would be handled based on what I I
 
01:38:35.950 --> 01:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier with regard to
 
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
emergency process okay thank you thank
 
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%

boards Association we are a private
 
01:39:09.229 --> 01:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization that provides
 
01:39:11.790 --> 01:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
services uh to school boards uh we are
 
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to House Bill 143 primarily for
 
01:39:16.510 --> 01:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
some of the reasons that have already
 
01:39:18.669 --> 01:39:18.679 align:start position:0%
been stated um some of your comments
 
01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy first these no trespass
 
01:39:23.629 --> 01:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
orders are are very rare in a school
 
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
context I reached out to about four or
 
01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
five superintendents in preparation for
 
01:39:30.109 --> 01:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
this bill and asked if they ever had do
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
issue one and and they had not um they
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
had had you know some angry parents or
 
01:39:36.669 --> 01:39:36.679 align:start position:0%
some angry constituents um you know on
 
01:39:38.189 --> 01:39:38.199 align:start position:0%
school grounds but they've never had to
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
go so far as to issue no trespass orders
 
01:39:44.669 --> 01:39:44.679 align:start position:0%
second um these no trespass orders that
 
01:39:46.709 --> 01:39:46.719 align:start position:0%
have been issued by some superintendent
 
01:39:48.669 --> 01:39:48.679 align:start position:0%
and I have one anecdotal story uh at the
 
01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
end of my testimony um need to be dealt
 
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
with immediately to address
 
01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
um and the the health and and safety and
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
Welfare of children whether or not
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's a belligerent parent a
 
01:40:02.350 --> 01:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
belligerent member of the public um but
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
it's usually um sort of an immediate
 
01:40:07.229 --> 01:40:07.239 align:start position:0%
response to something that may be
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
threatening or putting Children at Risk
 
01:40:12.910 --> 01:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
the third aspect um that we that I'd
 
01:40:15.629 --> 01:40:15.639 align:start position:0%
like to identify too is that while we
 
01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
the bill outlines a due process appeal
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
to the school board um superintendant
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
are responsible for the day-to-day
 
01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
management of school grounds that's
 
01:40:27.589 --> 01:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
found in RSA 194
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
C4 paragraph 2 um and then paragraph J
 
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
and K talks about the superintendent is
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for um staff student and
 
01:40:39.790 --> 01:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
parent safety and building issues and
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with citizens at large um and
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
the superintendent is also responsible
 
01:40:45.470 --> 01:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
for the assignment usage and maintenance
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
of administrative and school
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
facilities uh the last point that I want
 
01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
to make um we have a staff attorney uh
 
01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
at nhba who's been practicing law for 30
 
01:40:57.390 --> 01:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
plus years representing school districts
 
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:00.159 align:start position:0%
for um a number of those he said he had
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
one instance where a parent who had lost
 
01:41:06.189 --> 01:41:06.199 align:start position:0%
parental rights in another state showed
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
up at a school and the school had no
 
01:41:09.870 --> 01:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
notice that that individual had lost his
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
parental rights and had no Advanced
 
01:41:14.030 --> 01:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge of that the parent came into
 
01:41:15.310 --> 01:41:15.320 align:start position:0%
the school and was belligerent and
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
non-cooperative pushing past um a couple
 
01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
of the staff members and out of an
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
entrance and then ranting up and down
 
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
the hall the police in that matter would
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
only intervene upon the order of the
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
principal of that school um issuing a no
 
01:41:31.470 --> 01:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
trespass order so and in that instance
 
01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
there was a clear risk to the health and
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
safety um of students and staff members
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
and the police would only intervene upon
 
01:41:40.109 --> 01:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
the issuance of that principal writing a
 
01:41:42.270 --> 01:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
no trespass order so for those reasons
 
01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
the school boards Association um opposes
 
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
the bill we don't think having a we're
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
having to wait for five days or a week
 
01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
to for a school board to meet um it
 
01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
would be would be pertinent when we're
 
01:41:54.189 --> 01:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
trying to keep students safe and with
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to answer any
 
01:41:58.510 --> 01:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um would your
 
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
position not change if um it were
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
remended so that there was a procedure
 
01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
for an emergency order yeah thank you
 
01:42:06.270 --> 01:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
for the question chairman uh chairman
 
01:42:08.109 --> 01:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
Roy I did hear you hear you mention that
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
I I I'd want to give it some thought
 
01:42:11.550 --> 01:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
first but that certainly sounds
 
01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:13.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh the other aspect though
 
01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the unanimous aspect being
 
01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
a high bar we would oppose we would
 
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
oppose that um we have some school
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
boards that have 11 13 15 people
 
01:42:25.589 --> 01:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
if it's just one person that doesn't
 
01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
want to one doesn't want to go along but
 
01:42:29.629 --> 01:42:29.639 align:start position:0%
the other 14 people think that
 
01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
individual is a is a risk to the
 
01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
students we think that would should be
 
01:42:35.589 --> 01:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
amended as well too and also thinking I
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
would also want some clarification is it
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
going to be unanimous of those present
 
01:42:41.550 --> 01:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
in voting or is it unanimous of the
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
entire board and the event of board
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
member is not attending that meeting for
 
01:42:46.629 --> 01:42:46.639 align:start position:0%
whatever reason yeah I would contemplate
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
a majority um anyway so great and it
 
01:42:52.589 --> 01:42:52.599 align:start position:0%
would always I think due to the safety
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
aspect necessitate the president voting
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
certainly yeah okay uh representative
 
01:42:59.109 --> 01:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
rhods thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question could you just
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
walk us through the process if I were to
 
01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
get a a no trespass order this afternoon
 
01:43:09.589 --> 01:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
what what do I do sure thank you for the
 
01:43:11.070 --> 01:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
question representative I don't know if
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
I can if I can answer that I my
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
background is in school law I know
 
01:43:17.790 --> 01:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
nothing about criminal law I suppose I'm
 
01:43:20.189 --> 01:43:20.199 align:start position:0%
this is my own best guess representative
 
01:43:22.109 --> 01:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
if you were to walk to the conquered
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
school and were belligerent threatening
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
yelling profanities the principal of
 
01:43:28.910 --> 01:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
that school would issue a no trespass
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
order ordering you to leave and I
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
suppose if you did not leave or if you
 
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
came back subsequently they would call
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
the police and the police would come and
 
01:43:38.270 --> 01:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
you would potentially be arrested I but
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know criminal law so I that that
 
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
would be my best guess as to how how
 
01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:45.270 align:start position:0%
would be my best guess as to how how
those

01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:48.030 --> 01:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
operate thank you Mr chairman do they
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
when you're issued that is there is it
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
like infinite or is it you know don't
 
01:43:54.189 --> 01:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
come back for 10 days yeah certainly
 
01:43:55.390 --> 01:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
that that that's a good question I think
 
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
it would have to be how how how the no
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
trespass order was drafted I I believe
 
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
that they can be limited time 10 days 2
 
01:44:06.750 --> 01:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
weeks 30 days or I believe they can also
 
01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:12.750 align:start position:0%
weeks 30 days or I believe they can also
be

01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
permanent sh
 
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
um could you get back to us as soon as
 
01:44:22.350 --> 01:44:22.360 align:start position:0%
you can about how you would feel your
 
01:44:25.390 --> 01:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
organization feel about the proposal
 
01:44:29.589 --> 01:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
that uh chair Roy uh suggested having a
 
01:44:32.430 --> 01:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
an emergency procedure so there could be
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
an immediate issuance of a a temporary
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh no trespass order certainly I can
 
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
I can I'll discuss that um with um
 
01:44:43.229 --> 01:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
internally at our office um maybe on
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
Monday and get back to you Monday or
 
01:44:45.709 --> 01:44:45.719 align:start position:0%
Tuesday with with an email to the
 
01:44:48.350 --> 01:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
committee thank you thank
 
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
you no further questions thank you thank
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
morard uh do I shall I begin I'm sorry
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you John morard uh uh here today
 
01:45:27.270 --> 01:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh to share uh our experience and
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
process at uh a large city library uh
 
01:45:32.470 --> 01:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
I've been a trustee of the lonia public
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
library for I guess about a quarter
 
01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
Century uh and chairman for uh well I'm
 
01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
not sure a while I guess uh forgive me
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
while I try to get my magnifying glass
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
to agree with me
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
here uh so I we have uh we have a
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
process in place a policy a board policy
 
01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh that addresses many of these issues
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
and so as it seems that your uh proposed
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
Bill may affect uh how we uh interface
 
01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
with state law I wanted to share that
 
01:46:06.750 --> 01:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
with you if I may so uh my understanding
 
01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
is that uh representative bogert has
 
01:46:11.709 --> 01:46:11.719 align:start position:0%
just uh passed that out to the committee
 
01:46:13.149 --> 01:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
uh I won't read the whole thing this is
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
obviously one aspect of a larger policy
 
01:46:18.350 --> 01:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
manual and the antecedence of this lay
 
01:46:20.910 --> 01:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
out the groundwork for what constitutes
 
01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh aggressively
 
01:46:26.229 --> 01:46:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh violation aggressive violations of
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
our Behavior policy and how that dovet
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
Tales wor our mission statement so we
 
01:46:32.910 --> 01:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
tried to be uh robust about that before
 
01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
arriving at this particular aspect of it
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
but as you can see uh the lonia public
 
01:46:41.189 --> 01:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
library Behavior policy may be uh
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
individuals who violate uh the behavior
 
01:46:44.669 --> 01:46:44.679 align:start position:0%
policy may be denied access to the
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
library obviously we don't want to do
 
01:46:48.430 --> 01:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
that if we get to the point of a no
 
01:46:50.830 --> 01:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
trespass order we've effectively failed
 
01:46:53.070 --> 01:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
to communicate and manage our library
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
the way we would otherwise wish it to be
 
01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
done so that's sort of the last course
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh last remedy that we want to ever see
 
01:47:02.990 --> 01:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
the duration of the no trespass orders
 
01:47:05.310 --> 01:47:05.320 align:start position:0%
must be proportional to the underlying
 
01:47:08.189 --> 01:47:08.199 align:start position:0%
uh misconduct such patrons will be
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
provided with alternative access to the
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
library I mean that's a little unique to
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
libraries but we really it it does
 
01:47:17.709 --> 01:47:17.719 align:start position:0%
affect how we serve access uh to the
 
01:47:20.669 --> 01:47:20.679 align:start position:0%
library uh during the no trespass order
 
01:47:22.430 --> 01:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
in fact even what our appeals process
 
01:47:24.430 --> 01:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
looks like because if you've no trespass
 
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
somebody then that could be an issue as
 
01:47:28.270 --> 01:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
previously stated so we try to
 
01:47:30.430 --> 01:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
anticipate those concerns with this
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
policy uh so we want people to have
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
access to the materials uh to the extent
 
01:47:36.589 --> 01:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
that is feasible during the time of a no
 
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
trespass holder full-time Library staff
 
01:47:41.229 --> 01:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
are authorized to issue the no trespass
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
orders on behalf of the library for a
 
01:47:44.830 --> 01:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
period of up to two weeks there's an
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
emergency unveil unfolding in front of
 
01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:49.239 align:start position:0%
you you need to be nimble to react to it
 
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
in order to protect the well-being of
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
the occupants of the of the premises
 
01:47:56.350 --> 01:47:56.360 align:start position:0%
this is how we provided for that uh only
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
the director May issue a no trespass
 
01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
order for 15 days that's one day longer
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
than the two weeks or longer the library
 
01:48:05.589 --> 01:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
director will review all no tresp orders
 
01:48:07.709 --> 01:48:07.719 align:start position:0%
within two weeks 14 calendar days of the
 
01:48:10.189 --> 01:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
date of issuance and may adjust the
 
01:48:11.709 --> 01:48:11.719 align:start position:0%
duration of the orders and I want to be
 
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
clear it does not say extend there it
 
01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
says adjust perhaps it will be
 
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
lengthened perhaps it may be shortened
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh we we allow for the fact that people
 
01:48:21.589 --> 01:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
might have a bad day and in the as
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
temper cool and the of day then maybe
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
maybe things can be arranged differently
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
we like to provide for that
 
01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh ideally Laconia police
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
I'm going to actually skip this part but
 
01:48:33.149 --> 01:48:33.159 align:start position:0%
you can see how we tried to dovetail
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
with the police department what might be
 
01:48:37.709 --> 01:48:37.719 align:start position:0%
noteworthy here is that it's my
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that in the City of
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
Laconia by default a no trespass order
 
01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
is issued for one year and it has been
 
01:48:46.510 --> 01:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
our practice to shorten that to meet uh
 
01:48:49.629 --> 01:48:49.639 align:start position:0%
paragraph one above uh but if if no
 
01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
other action is taken that's the way
 
01:48:53.669 --> 01:48:53.679 align:start position:0%
that works and uh
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to pick this up uh I think
 
01:48:58.870 --> 01:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh a no trespass order may be appealed
 
01:49:00.589 --> 01:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
to the library trustees in writing
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
within 21 calendar days the date of uh
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
the issuance the trustees will review
 
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
the no trespass order uh the incident
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
report and any other available
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
information such as video uh
 
01:49:14.589 --> 01:49:14.599 align:start position:0%
surveillance and uh determine whether
 
01:49:17.310 --> 01:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
the violations actually even occurred uh
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
that's you know we obviously want to
 
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
support our staff uh but we we have an
 
01:49:22.239 --> 01:49:23.750 align:start position:0%
support our staff uh but we we have an
absolute

01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
absolute
 
01:49:25.470 --> 01:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
obligation to the community to provide
 
01:49:28.589 --> 01:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
them with access to materials and so we
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that it really does
 
01:49:33.149 --> 01:49:33.159 align:start position:0%
meet that paragraph one uh aggressively
 
01:49:35.470 --> 01:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
violate the behavior policy perhaps it
 
01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
does perhaps it doesn't uh the trustees
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
I think we did this uh whether the
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
violations occurred and whether a no
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
trespass order was reasonably Justified
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
a determination letter will be issued by
 
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
the trustees within 21 calendar days
 
01:49:51.390 --> 01:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
after receiving uh the uh the appeal
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
request I'd like to add that we've had
 
01:49:56.830 --> 01:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
this policy in a different form in place
 
01:49:59.550 --> 01:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
for quite some time I think it's fair to
 
01:50:03.709 --> 01:50:03.719 align:start position:0%
say decades uh we did uh and I'm happy
 
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
to answer this in questions later but we
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
did have uh a couple of opportunities
 
01:50:11.310 --> 01:50:11.320 align:start position:0%
where our appeal process was invoked and
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh did seek legal counsel and one of the
 
01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
reasons that this is in draft form today
 
01:50:18.189 --> 01:50:18.199 align:start position:0%
is because uh Council advises us that 21
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
days and 21 days is too long of a
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
duration uh so the proposal is to reduce
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
that uh to perhaps again two weeks so
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
that is that is what we do uh as I say
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
we're an active Library I do have some
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
statistics with me I can talk a little
 
01:50:35.310 --> 01:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
bit anecdotally about this if it's the
 
01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
pleasure of the committee but uh that
 
01:50:39.790 --> 01:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
ends my
 
01:50:43.629 --> 01:50:43.639 align:start position:0%
remarks thank you um I I I mayy I I
 
01:50:47.950 --> 01:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
believe um the lonia has a very um
 
01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
efficient uh process in place and it
 
01:50:51.870 --> 01:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
looks to me like it provides for due
 
01:50:56.430 --> 01:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
process so you are to be commended um I
 
01:50:58.709 --> 01:50:58.719 align:start position:0%
don't see where there is the ability to
 
01:51:01.470 --> 01:51:01.480 align:start position:0%
appeal beyond that to the court but that
 
01:51:03.229 --> 01:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily need to be part of
 
01:51:05.790 --> 01:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
your internal process so I think it it
 
01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
it's very good how many people do you
 
01:51:09.629 --> 01:51:09.639 align:start position:0%
serve these orders to a year do you
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
think uh we serve approximately 135,000
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
patrons a year how many no Pro no
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
trespass orders uh so if you if you look
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
at the last five years uh less than one
 
01:51:25.069 --> 01:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
100th of 1% of those the numbers are
 
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
interesting though because they tell a
 
01:51:29.709 --> 01:51:29.719 align:start position:0%
story so it's it's it is as rare as it's
 
01:51:33.550 --> 01:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
intended to be in Cal in this calendar
 
01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:34.430 align:start position:0%
intended to be in Cal in this calendar
year

01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
2025 we have served five no trespass
 
01:51:39.709 --> 01:51:39.719 align:start position:0%
orders I might point out that last night
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
we had our first board meeting of the of
 
01:51:43.629 --> 01:51:43.639 align:start position:0%
the year so uh I'm glad we didn't have
 
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
five board meetings this year this month
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh 2024 was much better we had five no
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
trespass orders the entire calendar year
 
01:51:51.119 --> 01:51:53.229 align:start position:0%
trespass orders the entire calendar year
20237

01:51:53.229 --> 01:51:53.239 align:start position:0%
20237
 
01:51:58.430 --> 01:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
2022 27 20216 and
 
01:52:01.310 --> 01:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
20202 and those those are just the no
 
01:52:04.030 --> 01:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
trespass orders we do have to a certain
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
degree we track uh events that might
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
have risen to the Le level of a no
 
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
trespass order but didn't so I'm proud
 
01:52:13.629 --> 01:52:13.639 align:start position:0%
of the fact that we seem to be able to
 
01:52:16.109 --> 01:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
manage that uh that difference well did
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
you um correlate that to certain events
 
01:52:20.430 --> 01:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
going on in the library at the time that
 
01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
that would um increase the number of no
 
01:52:25.069 --> 01:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
trespass tress orders funny you should
 
01:52:27.149 --> 01:52:27.159 align:start position:0%
to answer your question no uh but as I'm
 
01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
looking at this I'm mentally trying to
 
01:52:32.069 --> 01:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
correlate it and I honestly cannot it
 
01:52:34.109 --> 01:52:34.119 align:start position:0%
would be interesting to see if there was
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
something going on within the community
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
or at the library at a certain time that
 
01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
caused that increase and in your policy
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
you you allow people somehow access to
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
the to the books without necessarily
 
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
having access to the library is is that
 
01:52:49.950 --> 01:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
what um I think that's a good policy
 
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
because sometimes people just don't fit
 
01:52:53.550 --> 01:52:53.560 align:start position:0%
well around among other people but they
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
still should have a right to access
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
books which may be their only um source
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
of information or entertainment well one
 
01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
of the things that was Paramount in our
 
01:53:04.270 --> 01:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
mind when we draft this is oftentimes
 
01:53:05.790 --> 01:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot going on in someone's life
 
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
when they get to this level of duress
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
and access to materials that might help
 
01:53:12.270 --> 01:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
them defend themselves is a is a
 
01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
critical part of what our function is so
 
01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
yes we do uh we have a home delivery
 
01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
service we try to bring materials to
 
01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
them wherever they are uh
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know if they're if they're residents
 
01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
oftentimes that's a little easier than
 
01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
if they're transient but uh We've we've
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
made we've made all the efforts we can
 
01:53:34.030 --> 01:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
to do so thank you I appreciate it
 
01:53:35.950 --> 01:53:35.960 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:53:40.669 --> 01:53:40.679 align:start position:0%
rhs thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:53:44.189 --> 01:53:44.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm just curious
 
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
so if this is issued do you provide an
 
01:53:50.430 --> 01:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a public hearing that's
 
01:53:52.069 --> 01:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
in writing when you're giving it to the
 
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
subject that received the
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
notice if I may speak
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
anecdotally uh in the again in the
 
01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
quarter Century I've been part of the
 
01:54:03.310 --> 01:54:03.320 align:start position:0%
board I've had two circumstances that
 
01:54:05.310 --> 01:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of that have risen to what I
 
01:54:08.589 --> 01:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
would call an appeal appeal level uh and
 
01:54:11.149 --> 01:54:11.159 align:start position:0%
in that case when the when the most
 
01:54:14.069 --> 01:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
times when no trespass orders are issued
 
01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
most of the recipients have uh the
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
response of oh shocks you you got me
 
01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:20.719 align:start position:0%
okay I'll I'll see you next year or next
 
01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
week or whatever the duration is
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh in the two appeal situations uh there
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
was immediate push back and they wanted
 
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
to know what the process was and they
 
01:54:32.430 --> 01:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
were given the Chairman's uh in my case
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
my personal cell phone number they
 
01:54:36.589 --> 01:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
reached out to me directly uh in both
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
cases I met them at a a homeless shelter
 
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh where they were staying and I sat
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
with them and went through the process
 
01:54:46.510 --> 01:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh helping them understand what what
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
that what that appeal how they initiated
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
that appeals process and then I reached
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
out because our no trespass was specific
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
about the library premises not all
 
01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
municipal buildings within lonia I
 
01:54:59.149 --> 01:54:59.159 align:start position:0%
arranged with the uh City manager's
 
01:55:02.470 --> 01:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
office to receive the official request
 
01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:05.639 align:start position:0%
which in both cases did not
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
happen so to clarify though on the
 
01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
notice that you give them the no
 
01:55:12.149 --> 01:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
trespass does it State their appeal
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
rights on it I I'm sorry no I do not
 
01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
believe it does okay thank you thank you
 
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
see no further questions oh who repres
 
01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:25.109 align:start position:0%
see no further questions oh who repres
repr

01:55:25.109 --> 01:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:27.069 --> 01:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
Muse one of the things I think we've
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
heard in in testimonies there does seem
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
to be some variability between let's say
 
01:55:33.069 --> 01:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
the needs of a library the needs to a
 
01:55:34.629 --> 01:55:34.639 align:start position:0%
school but there do seem to be some
 
01:55:36.830 --> 01:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
basic uh guardrails that need to be
 
01:55:39.629 --> 01:55:39.639 align:start position:0%
there a right to do process a right to a
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
right to appeal um uh the addition of
 
01:55:45.629 --> 01:55:45.639 align:start position:0%
something like a a temporary order
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
process things like that um I I noticed
 
01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
that the policies that I've seen uh and
 
01:55:53.109 --> 01:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
some of the policies the representative
 
01:55:55.589 --> 01:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
handed us your policy they're they're
 
01:55:59.229 --> 01:55:59.239 align:start position:0%
different as we draft the law we need do
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
would you agree that we need to keep in
 
01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
mind uh the needs of different types of
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
Municipal and school organizations or or
 
01:56:11.870 --> 01:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
different types of public
 
01:56:14.589 --> 01:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
property well I'm generally speaking an
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
advocate of uh one siiz is not fit all
 
01:56:18.790 --> 01:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
so I I see the wisdom of that for
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
certain uh it it's certainly not the
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
first time I've heard baric Christina's
 
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
voice uh name come up in a room and so I
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
I can say that I I do know that that
 
01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
different circumstances require
 
01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
different uh parameters uh the one the
 
01:56:35.310 --> 01:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
one thing that you didn't really ask
 
01:56:37.149 --> 01:56:37.159 align:start position:0%
this question but if I could add to it
 
01:56:40.589 --> 01:56:40.599 align:start position:0%
that uh that I I wonder if
 
01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
there's room for consideration is the
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
difference between an emergency response
 
01:56:47.950 --> 01:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
and a standard protocol and I do think
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
as as baric Mr Christina I apologize uh
 
01:56:54.669 --> 01:56:54.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned that in our case the library
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
director is uh responsible for running
 
01:56:59.790 --> 01:56:59.800 align:start position:0%
the day-to-day operations and likewise
 
01:57:01.709 --> 01:57:01.719 align:start position:0%
superintendants of schools as he pointed
 
01:57:05.390 --> 01:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
out uh are that responsible party and so
 
01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
having that be part of the regular
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
protocol so that they are already
 
01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
working in the parameters that are
 
01:57:12.430 --> 01:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
unique to them seems prudent to me as a
 
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
lay person uh and then that preserves
 
01:57:18.430 --> 01:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
the Appellate function of the board the
 
01:57:21.069 --> 01:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
school board the Board of Trustees is a
 
01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
as a body and process already in place
 
01:57:25.950 --> 01:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
to to react to that rather than being
 
01:57:29.109 --> 01:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
the norm and then making the the UN the
 
01:57:32.109 --> 01:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
uh the outlier be the emergency protocol
 
01:57:34.390 --> 01:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
so I I know I went beyond your question
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
I hope I answered your question
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative that was actually a great
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
answer thank
 
01:57:40.990 --> 01:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
you see you enough for the questions

from the city manager of Lone I'll I'll

please accept this letter as my
 
01:58:32.990 --> 01:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
opposition to the current language
 
01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
included in HB 143 this is being sent as
 
01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
a result of consultation with other City
 
01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
departments heads and not being sent on
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of the city council we have not
 
01:58:47.830 --> 01:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
had time to approach the city council
 
01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
with this when it was brought to our
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
attention so I apologize for that we
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
don't see the city council other than uh
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the
 
01:59:02.589 --> 01:59:02.599 align:start position:0%
opportunities to make adjustments to the
 
01:59:05.669 --> 01:59:05.679 align:start position:0%
bill we are not
 
01:59:09.069 --> 01:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
against adjustments to the bill we as
 
01:59:13.550 --> 01:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
the bill is written it is too closed in
 
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
to allow for emergency situations to
 
01:59:21.229 --> 01:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
take place and it's as discussing this
 
01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
with these
 
01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
sponsors uh it was brought to our
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
attention if someone's breaking the law
 
01:59:30.149 --> 01:59:30.159 align:start position:0%
then arrest them well there's a lot of
 
01:59:33.790 --> 01:59:33.800 align:start position:0%
situations that does not require to
 
01:59:36.030 --> 01:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
actually put someone in in jail in
 
01:59:38.310 --> 01:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
Booking you could take people who are
 
01:59:42.510 --> 01:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
having a bad moment and as the previous
 
01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
document that was uh provided to
 
01:59:48.510 --> 01:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
you you can put guard whs in place may
 
01:59:52.109 --> 01:59:52.119 align:start position:0%
it be 5 10 15 days you have
 
01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities for them to uh have a
 
01:59:59.189 --> 01:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
recourse uh I do agree that the
 
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
trustpass should uh uh the trespass
 
02:00:07.149 --> 02:00:07.159 align:start position:0%
notice should uh have on there what the
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
ability to uh ask for rehearing on this
 
02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
so I do agree with that that's very
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
important uh but it is also important
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
that a department head uh the uh are in
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
this case in a library where you have a
 
02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
lot of children you have to be able to
 
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
react immediately and and take care of
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
the situation so within that policy you
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
saw that they are
 
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
different uh avenues that parts of the
 
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
process that are taken that provide this
 
02:00:45.470 --> 02:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
for the person that was given the
 
02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:46.990 align:start position:0%
for the person that was given the
trespass

02:00:46.990 --> 02:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
trespass
 
02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.950 align:start position:0%
trespass
notice

02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
notice
 
02:00:52.189 --> 02:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
um so the city of lonia at times must
 
02:00:54.669 --> 02:00:54.679 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to easily issue no
 
02:00:57.229 --> 02:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
trespass orders on individual as
 
02:01:00.069 --> 02:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
protective measures for both employees
 
02:01:02.350 --> 02:01:02.360 align:start position:0%
and customer safety many of our
 
02:01:04.510 --> 02:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
department heads Who oversee building
 
02:01:07.229 --> 02:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
employee security have had to issue no
 
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
trespass orders and must continue to
 
02:01:11.950 --> 02:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
have this option when an individual goes
 
02:01:14.589 --> 02:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
to the municipal building and is causing
 
02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
a significant disruption to operation
 
02:01:20.589 --> 02:01:20.599 align:start position:0%
being threatening or com committing non
 
02:01:23.470 --> 02:01:23.480 align:start position:0%
arrestable Petty Crim crime it is often
 
02:01:25.470 --> 02:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
under law enforcement's guidance that
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
the best course of
 
02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
action to issue a no trespass order the
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
order must be from the building owner
 
02:01:38.589 --> 02:01:38.599 align:start position:0%
representative the ability to do this
 
02:01:41.189 --> 02:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
needs to be immediate and unrealistic to
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
wait for a duly noticed
 
02:01:47.470 --> 02:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
meeting because as you know a duly noted
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
meeting has to be what 10 days notice so
 
02:01:53.669 --> 02:01:53.679 align:start position:0%
within 10 days there's a lot of things
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
that can happen while you're trying to
 
02:02:00.030 --> 02:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
accomplish something the ability to do
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
this needs to be immediate and
 
02:02:03.550 --> 02:02:03.560 align:start position:0%
unrealistic wait for duly noticed
 
02:02:05.950 --> 02:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
meetings andot my department heads are
 
02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for the safety of their
 
02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
buildings their visitors libraries are
 
02:02:13.709 --> 02:02:13.719 align:start position:0%
full of children and those who work
 
02:02:15.870 --> 02:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
there taking away this ability makes
 
02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
them their safety is is appropriate and
 
02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
I'll hand this letter over to you when
 
02:02:28.189 --> 02:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:33.149 --> 02:02:33.159 align:start position:0%
um even though the uh no trespass order
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't have it within their policy they
 
02:02:39.109 --> 02:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
a no trespass order may be appealed to
 
02:02:41.629 --> 02:02:41.639 align:start position:0%
the library trustees in writing within
 
02:02:44.229 --> 02:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
21 days that's where it's important to
 
02:02:48.390 --> 02:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
have that noted on the no trespass order
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
the trustees will review the no trespass
 
02:02:53.189 --> 02:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
order the incident report and any other
 
02:02:55.470 --> 02:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
available information determine whether
 
02:02:57.390 --> 02:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
the violations occurred or whether the
 
02:03:00.589 --> 02:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
no transport order was reasonably
 
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
Justified a determination letter would
 
02:03:06.069 --> 02:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
be issued by trustees within 21 days
 
02:03:09.750 --> 02:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
after receiving the appeal
 
02:03:13.069 --> 02:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
now one of the questions that came up
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
with uh does it say on the trespass
 
02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
order that they have the ability to go
 
02:03:22.669 --> 02:03:22.679 align:start position:0%
to court well that's an unspeak
 
02:03:25.069 --> 02:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
ability anybody has the right to go to
 
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
court for just about anything so that's
 
02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
a given in the state of New
 
02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:35.030 align:start position:0%
a given in the state of New
Hampshire

02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
um so as I
 
02:03:43.390 --> 02:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
said these guidelines are are are good
 
02:03:45.030 --> 02:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines you could take out the
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
library and and Institute a lot of
 
02:03:49.629 --> 02:03:49.639 align:start position:0%
different verbiage may it be
 
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities or something like that
 
02:03:57.069 --> 02:03:57.079 align:start position:0%
but it provides a guidance so that
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
uh towns and cities have an ability to
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
do something but the person that's
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
acting against uh is acting to get this
 
02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
trespassing order has the ability to go
 
02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:20.109 --> 02:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:22.510 --> 02:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you for your
 
02:04:24.910 --> 02:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and if I may say one thing we
 
02:04:28.950 --> 02:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
would be happy to an amendment with such
 
02:04:33.310 --> 02:04:33.320 align:start position:0%
an item is this that does not restrict
 
02:04:36.030 --> 02:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
everything so much so an amendment to
 
02:04:40.229 --> 02:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
this uh would be agreeable thank you
 
02:04:42.430 --> 02:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
we'll take that into consideration
 
02:04:43.870 --> 02:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to testify in this
 
02:04:46.510 --> 02:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
bill who has not done so see a none I
 
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:53.470 --> 02:04:53.480 align:start position:0%

02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh most of these get done on time but
 
02:32:48.830 --> 02:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
where we have issues
 
02:32:53.910 --> 02:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
is very busy day towards the end of the
 
02:32:56.990 --> 02:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
shift it's time to go
 
02:32:59.269 --> 02:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
home and if we have to fill them out
 
02:33:01.269 --> 02:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
within the 24 hours we're paying
 
02:33:06.349 --> 02:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
overtime for them to sit and fill out uh
 
02:33:08.870 --> 02:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
which may be a
 
02:33:12.910 --> 02:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
routine patient we have frequent flyers
 
02:33:18.190 --> 02:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
or whatever uh I will add that if it's a
 
02:33:20.990 --> 02:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
serious call they will absolutely stay
 
02:33:23.590 --> 02:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
and finish that report it's just when
 
02:33:27.750 --> 02:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
you have three or four routine calls um
 
02:33:29.389 --> 02:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
that nobody's really going to look at
 
02:33:32.670 --> 02:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
them or needs to look at them uh we're
 
02:33:34.790 --> 02:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
just asking for more time I looked at
 
02:33:38.070 --> 02:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
seven days because uh
 
02:33:41.990 --> 02:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
some people's schedule have up to four
 
02:33:45.070 --> 02:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
days in a row off and sometimes I think
 
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's one shift that does five days in
 
02:33:48.750 --> 02:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
a row off because they they stack them
 
02:33:51.429 --> 02:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
in the front and give them five days off
 
02:33:53.750 --> 02:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
so that way there's plenty of time to
 
02:33:58.230 --> 02:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:01.710 --> 02:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
trouble um and with that I'll take
 
02:34:05.710 --> 02:34:05.720 align:start position:0%
questions would this um well a couple
 
02:34:08.150 --> 02:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
things if someone has an incident
 
02:34:10.630 --> 02:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
towards the end of their shift and they
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
have to do this report within what does
 
02:34:16.070 --> 02:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
it currently say within 24 hours yep do
 
02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
they have to stay and does that cost
 
02:34:20.469 --> 02:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
overtime they have to stay and cost
 
02:34:22.790 --> 02:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
overtime and would you what is your
 
02:34:24.590 --> 02:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
opinion throughout the course of the
 
02:34:26.030 --> 02:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
year is that is we talking about a lot
 
02:34:27.950 --> 02:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
of money and overtime for these reports
 
02:34:32.309 --> 02:34:32.319 align:start position:0%
so you look at Statewide that's a lot of
 
02:34:35.710 --> 02:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
money right I know in my department it
 
02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:37.469 align:start position:0%
money right I know in my department it
adds

02:34:37.469 --> 02:34:37.479 align:start position:0%
adds
 
02:34:42.070 --> 02:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
up and as's a followup to that by doing
 
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
this it will allow First Responders to
 
02:34:47.790 --> 02:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
do the report on their next scheduled
 
02:34:49.870 --> 02:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
shift when they're not when they're the
 
02:34:51.630 --> 02:34:51.640 align:start position:0%
clock anyway so will this amount to a
 
02:34:55.550 --> 02:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
large savings you think yeah absolutely
 
02:34:58.990 --> 02:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh cuz I I look at this if you're making
 
02:35:01.070 --> 02:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
my people stay on overtime that becomes
 
02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
an unfunded mandate right because you're
 
02:35:05.750 --> 02:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
you're requiring them to stay after
 
02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:06.950 align:start position:0%
you're requiring them to stay after
their

02:35:06.950 --> 02:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:35:09.389 --> 02:35:09.399 align:start position:0%
shift I have to pay them or the
 
02:35:12.550 --> 02:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
department has to pay them um that's an
 
02:35:16.269 --> 02:35:16.279 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate so this this bill could
 
02:35:19.269 --> 02:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
lead to savings for taxpayers absolutely
 
02:35:20.990 --> 02:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
02:35:22.710 --> 02:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
yes represent Murphy and then I saw you
 
02:35:24.469 --> 02:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
repres thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:35:26.670 --> 02:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'm just
 
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
thinking as a reti nurse we would often
 
02:35:30.990 --> 02:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
have to do the same thing to type notes
 
02:35:32.469 --> 02:35:32.479 align:start position:0%
at the end and we could be there
 
02:35:34.910 --> 02:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes hours after our shift it ended
 
02:35:37.349 --> 02:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
um and the the rationale for requiring
 
02:35:41.070 --> 02:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
that um to be done immediately was
 
02:35:44.510 --> 02:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
because over time your memory might not
 
02:35:45.870 --> 02:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
recall everything and there was a
 
02:35:48.110 --> 02:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
concern it would be a concern about the
 
02:35:50.750 --> 02:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
the note not accurately reflecting
 
02:35:53.230 --> 02:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
whatever should have been documented
 
02:35:55.389 --> 02:35:55.399 align:start position:0%
what would your response be to that
 
02:35:58.190 --> 02:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
concern for the same
 
02:36:02.110 --> 02:36:02.120 align:start position:0%
issue so to be honest with you I I've
 
02:36:05.349 --> 02:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
done some I haven't done them and did
 
02:36:06.670 --> 02:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
them when I came
 
02:36:08.910 --> 02:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
back uh I don't think I have dementia
 
02:36:11.910 --> 02:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
yet so I think they're pretty accurate
 
02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:14.510 align:start position:0%
yet so I think they're pretty accurate
um

02:36:14.510 --> 02:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:19.790 --> 02:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
and and like I said if it's a uh true
 
02:36:22.309 --> 02:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
emergent call we're absolutely going to
 
02:36:23.870 --> 02:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
pay the overtimes you can stay and do
 
02:36:28.110 --> 02:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
your report but I I fell down and broke
 
02:36:30.750 --> 02:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
my finger and I need a ride to the
 
02:36:33.590 --> 02:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
hospital I think I got all those details
 
02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
those are the ones that were really
 
02:36:37.630 --> 02:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
looking at because to be honest with you
 
02:36:41.349 --> 02:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
and we have a lot of just
 
02:36:45.590 --> 02:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
routine very basic truly not emergent
 
02:36:47.550 --> 02:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
they just have no other way to get to
 
02:36:51.309 --> 02:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
the hospital so although all that stuff
 
02:36:51.319 --> 02:36:53.349 align:start position:0%
the hospital so although all that stuff
is

02:36:53.349 --> 02:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:36:56.429 --> 02:36:56.439 align:start position:0%
pretty thank you um my other question
 
02:37:00.190 --> 02:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
would be would there be anybody like if
 
02:37:02.030 --> 02:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
you were not to do your notes till
 
02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
whatever three days from now would there
 
02:37:08.790 --> 02:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
be any um lack of patient care or would
 
02:37:11.070 --> 02:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
there be any problems encountered by
 
02:37:13.269 --> 02:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
somebody else as a result of not having
 
02:37:15.469 --> 02:37:15.479 align:start position:0%
the information for that note who would
 
02:37:17.349 --> 02:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
be using that note maybe in those three
 
02:37:21.190 --> 02:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
days nobody okay as far as I know nobody
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
the hospital has access to our reports
 
02:37:28.349 --> 02:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
um I remember
 
02:37:31.750 --> 02:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
when they were first setting this up I
 
02:37:35.710 --> 02:37:35.720 align:start position:0%
was in a conference call and the uh the
 
02:37:39.309 --> 02:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
medical control doc was on the phone
 
02:37:42.349 --> 02:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
call and this and that he wanted them
 
02:37:44.670 --> 02:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
immediately because I need this
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
paperwork for to make my diagnosis of a
 
02:37:49.790 --> 02:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
trauma victim and I came right off from
 
02:37:53.830 --> 02:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
mutant said so me as a basic
 
02:37:57.990 --> 02:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
EMT you as a trauma doctor need to step
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
out after I finish writing my report in
 
02:38:03.590 --> 02:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
the ER read it and make your diagnosis
 
02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
is that what you're telling
 
02:38:08.429 --> 02:38:08.439 align:start position:0%
me and all I heard was
 
02:38:11.150 --> 02:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
crickets I said so right you're not even
 
02:38:13.510 --> 02:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
going to read my report are you he goes
 
02:38:17.070 --> 02:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
yeah probably not right so I don't
 
02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
believe anybody is is
 
02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
looking at these especially on those
 
02:38:23.870 --> 02:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
routine calls sure I'm sure if we
 
02:38:27.550 --> 02:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
brought in and even still we have 24
 
02:38:28.950 --> 02:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
hours to do
 
02:38:32.190 --> 02:38:32.200 align:start position:0%
it so if I bring them in at 6:00 a.m.
 
02:38:34.710 --> 02:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
and I don't write it till 6:00 a.m.
 
02:38:36.510 --> 02:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow the hospital has already
 
02:38:38.710 --> 02:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
started treating that and the other
 
02:38:41.230 --> 02:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
piece of that is pretty much everything
 
02:38:44.190 --> 02:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to put in my report I hand off
 
02:38:46.990 --> 02:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
to the nurse in the Ed right I give her
 
02:38:49.790 --> 02:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
all that report I rip off my 12 lead
 
02:38:53.550 --> 02:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
give her that give her everything and we
 
02:38:57.030 --> 02:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
answer questions and what have you and
 
02:39:00.309 --> 02:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
off we go and I'm going to tell you most
 
02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:08.030 --> 02:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
billing thank you billing and perhaps
 
02:39:10.110 --> 02:39:10.120 align:start position:0%
insurance claims later well that's
 
02:39:12.349 --> 02:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
that's what I mean yeah I mean insurance
 
02:39:14.510 --> 02:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
investigations later on if there was a
 
02:39:16.389 --> 02:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
payout or something um representative
 
02:39:19.590 --> 02:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
Harry gathre
 
02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
02:39:24.070 --> 02:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
would you have a problem with say 48
 
02:39:27.590 --> 02:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
hour I mean 48 yeah 48 Hours 3 days I'm
 
02:39:29.510 --> 02:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
going to tell you because it they have
 
02:39:30.910 --> 02:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
four days
 
02:39:34.429 --> 02:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
off oh after incident right so if it's
 
02:39:34.439 --> 02:39:35.510 align:start position:0%
off oh after incident right so if it's
on

02:39:35.510 --> 02:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:39:39.309 --> 02:39:39.319 align:start position:0%
my some of them are working like 24 on
 
02:39:43.790 --> 02:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
24 off 24 on 4 days
 
02:39:47.309 --> 02:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
off so if if it's at that last shift
 
02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to be gone for four four
 
02:39:52.710 --> 02:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
days right well I guess it's you're
 
02:39:54.550 --> 02:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
leaving on one and you're coming back on
 
02:39:57.630 --> 02:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
the morning of that fourth day right
 
02:39:59.790 --> 02:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
something like that okay right even with
 
02:40:02.469 --> 02:40:02.479 align:start position:0%
that I just think seven days you want to
 
02:40:05.870 --> 02:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
do five time you know I'll do
 
02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
five because it's four days right so
 
02:40:11.910 --> 02:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so I always like to build in a
 
02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:12.990 align:start position:0%
yeah so I always like to build in a
little

02:40:12.990 --> 02:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
little
 
02:40:15.790 --> 02:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
extra you're quite
 
02:40:20.429 --> 02:40:20.439 align:start position:0%
aor yeah yeah I just think I put I put
 
02:40:22.830 --> 02:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
seven cuz if they're sick that first day
 
02:40:24.750 --> 02:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
they'll be back on that second and that
 
02:40:28.910 --> 02:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:31.429 --> 02:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
right I can go with
 
02:40:33.510 --> 02:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
five representa
 
02:40:36.630 --> 02:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
pette okay any further questions yes
 
02:40:38.710 --> 02:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
represent M sorry thank you I'm I'm just
 
02:40:40.910 --> 02:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
thinking I agree with a little shorter
 
02:40:43.950 --> 02:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
time frame I recognize we understanding
 
02:40:45.950 --> 02:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
that many calls are repetitive and there
 
02:40:47.710 --> 02:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
are people well known to you with the
 
02:40:51.790 --> 02:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
same problem over and over that said um
 
02:40:53.269 --> 02:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
if we're going to put it in into we're
 
02:40:56.190 --> 02:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
going to legislate this then should
 
02:40:58.990 --> 02:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
there be just a little bit more concise
 
02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:00.349 align:start position:0%
there be just a little bit more concise
parameters

02:41:00.349 --> 02:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
parameters
 
02:41:04.230 --> 02:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
around which types of incidents can wait
 
02:41:06.630 --> 02:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
five days and which can't like you said
 
02:41:09.110 --> 02:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
you would just because you're a
 
02:41:11.750 --> 02:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
responsible person you would always
 
02:41:14.070 --> 02:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
complete something on a on a bigger deal
 
02:41:15.990 --> 02:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
than a maybe a fractioned finger or
 
02:41:19.309 --> 02:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
something but could this this would just
 
02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
leave it to cop launch I mean you could
 
02:41:23.990 --> 02:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
have a major trauma and still not have
 
02:41:26.990 --> 02:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
to do that so our our call levels are
 
02:41:30.150 --> 02:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
alpha yeah bravo charlie delta yeah and
 
02:41:35.269 --> 02:41:35.279 align:start position:0%
Echo right so Alpha is minor Bravo is
 
02:41:38.110 --> 02:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
just a little bit above you
 
02:41:40.670 --> 02:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
know Alpha is usually standing at the
 
02:41:43.870 --> 02:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
curb with their baggage Bravo they have
 
02:41:46.830 --> 02:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
a bleed on my finger that I have to stop
 
02:41:49.790 --> 02:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
Charlie you kind of getting there
 
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
so Delta and Echo you're in serious
 
02:41:56.389 --> 02:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
trouble so I would say Delta and Echo
 
02:41:59.190 --> 02:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
have to be done okay yeah and then the
 
02:42:01.910 --> 02:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
others can wait is that Alpha phonetic
 
02:42:04.429 --> 02:42:04.439 align:start position:0%
categorization a a Statewide thing
 
02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely everybody knows that's how n
 
02:42:09.510 --> 02:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
911 dispatches them and that's how we uh
 
02:42:11.550 --> 02:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
correlate I was going to suggest if if
 
02:42:14.750 --> 02:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
not that leave some type of management
 
02:42:16.830 --> 02:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
prerogative where it just said whoever
 
02:42:19.590 --> 02:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
unless at the direction of the senior um
 
02:42:20.990 --> 02:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
the report can be done within so many
 
02:42:23.150 --> 02:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
days yeah something someone where
 
02:42:25.150 --> 02:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
someone could the boss could say n that
 
02:42:27.190 --> 02:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
one I think I'm I'm going to hear from
 
02:42:28.550 --> 02:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
usually what happens
 
02:42:32.030 --> 02:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
anyway I mean if there's a a bad call
 
02:42:35.150 --> 02:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
who's ever in charge that of that shift
 
02:42:36.950 --> 02:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
won't let anybody leave until all the
 
02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:38.750 align:start position:0%
won't let anybody leave until all the
paperwork's

02:42:38.750 --> 02:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
paperwork's
 
02:42:42.750 --> 02:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
done any further questions um maybe the
 
02:42:44.309 --> 02:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
people who ask the questions could work
 
02:42:46.349 --> 02:42:46.359 align:start position:0%
together with you to get it amended so
 
02:42:49.469 --> 02:42:49.479 align:start position:0%
we can execute in a week or so all right
 
02:42:49.479 --> 02:42:50.269 align:start position:0%
we can execute in a week or so all right
thank

02:42:50.269 --> 02:42:50.279 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:42:52.790 --> 02:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
you anyone else wish to testify on this
 
02:42:54.550 --> 02:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
bill has it done so I see you attracted
 
02:42:55.830 --> 02:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
a big crowd there all your friends

showed uping up the show
 
02:43:02.630 --> 02:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
so and with that I close the public
 
02:43:10.830 --> 02:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:14.469 --> 02:43:14.479 align:start position:0%
1:30 yeah but I we told them no no
 
02:43:14.479 --> 02:43:15.349 align:start position:0%
1:30 yeah but I we told them no no
that's

02:43:15.349 --> 02:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's

Bill

03:31:29.830 --> 03:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:31:32.429 --> 03:31:32.439 align:start position:0%
291 regarding
 
03:31:35.070 --> 03:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
fertilizer and I ask the prime sponsor
 
03:31:40.469 --> 03:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:42.710 --> 03:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
this thank you Mr chairman for the
 
03:31:45.030 --> 03:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
record I am Erica Leon representing the
 
03:31:46.510 --> 03:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
town of dairy
 
03:31:48.309 --> 03:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm Vice chair of executive
 
03:31:50.670 --> 03:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
departments and administration and jail
 
03:31:54.550 --> 03:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
car um and I bring this bill to you
 
03:31:56.429 --> 03:31:56.439 align:start position:0%
because for those of you who are around
 
03:31:58.550 --> 03:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
last year you probably don't remember
 
03:32:00.910 --> 03:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
the bill about fertilizer application
 
03:32:02.870 --> 03:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
going through the normal process you
 
03:32:06.150 --> 03:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
don't remember when it um passed through
 
03:32:08.510 --> 03:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
um ex environment and agriculture on the
 
03:32:10.309 --> 03:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
consent calendar and moved over to the
 
03:32:12.110 --> 03:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
Senate you don't remember when it went
 
03:32:14.950 --> 03:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
through there quietly and easily because
 
03:32:16.630 --> 03:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of this makes
 
03:32:18.750 --> 03:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
but you probably do remember when we had
 
03:32:21.750 --> 03:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
to override the governor's veto so the
 
03:32:24.389 --> 03:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
governor vetoed the bill um because for
 
03:32:25.510 --> 03:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
a few
 
03:32:28.070 --> 03:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
reasons uh I included The veto message
 
03:32:30.030 --> 03:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
on what I passed around and he said
 
03:32:31.750 --> 03:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
despite this bill's well sought
 
03:32:33.550 --> 03:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
intention to reduce fertilizer
 
03:32:35.590 --> 03:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
contamination it contains several
 
03:32:38.389 --> 03:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
unworkable and impractical Provisions
 
03:32:40.189 --> 03:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
rather than focus and he talks about the
 
03:32:42.389 --> 03:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
focus it says this would put countless
 
03:32:44.710 --> 03:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
well-meaning families unintentionally in
 
03:32:46.469 --> 03:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
violation of the law when maintaining
 
03:32:48.830 --> 03:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
their privately owned laws so this law
 
03:32:50.790 --> 03:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to golf courses athletic
 
03:32:53.110 --> 03:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
fields or Parks but it applies to your
 
03:32:56.550 --> 03:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
lawn and if you did some homework and
 
03:32:58.510 --> 03:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
looked at what this bill is doing and
 
03:33:00.309 --> 03:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
which section of law it touches you
 
03:33:02.150 --> 03:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have found it because this law
 
03:33:03.790 --> 03:33:03.800 align:start position:0%
is in effect and you can get a
 
03:33:05.150 --> 03:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for putting the wrong
 
03:33:07.590 --> 03:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
fertilizer on your law but since we
 
03:33:09.990 --> 03:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
overlo overrode The veto back in October
 
03:33:11.550 --> 03:33:11.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't even show up on the general
 
03:33:14.630 --> 03:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
court website yet so you if you're using
 
03:33:16.469 --> 03:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
last year's fertilizer putting on your
 
03:33:18.510 --> 03:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
lawn your neighbor knows about this law
 
03:33:21.150 --> 03:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
and TS you in you could be charged with
 
03:33:21.160 --> 03:33:22.110 align:start position:0%
and TS you in you could be charged with
a

03:33:22.110 --> 03:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:33:24.150 --> 03:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor so what we need to come back
 
03:33:26.990 --> 03:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
to is sort of what happened with this
 
03:33:29.110 --> 03:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
bill um they put it in the soil
 
03:33:32.110 --> 03:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
amendment section and the section on
 
03:33:34.429 --> 03:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
fertilizers which always dealt with
 
03:33:36.309 --> 03:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
people who manufacture fertilizers and
 
03:33:38.429 --> 03:33:38.439 align:start position:0%
sell fertilizers in the past so the
 
03:33:39.910 --> 03:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
penalties in that chapter are
 
03:33:41.750 --> 03:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors for natural persons and
 
03:33:44.309 --> 03:33:44.319 align:start position:0%
felonies for all others because if your
 
03:33:47.150 --> 03:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
business is in the wrong fertilizers
 
03:33:48.990 --> 03:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
especially if you're mislabeling them
 
03:33:50.550 --> 03:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
that's a serious problem and that
 
03:33:53.469 --> 03:33:53.479 align:start position:0%
deserves misdemeanor or felony this
 
03:33:55.790 --> 03:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
section for the first time in the
 
03:33:58.070 --> 03:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
statute deals with your average everyday
 
03:34:01.189 --> 03:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
person now your average everyday person
 
03:34:03.070 --> 03:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
who's putting on fertilizer they bought
 
03:34:04.830 --> 03:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
last year could be charged with a
 
03:34:07.070 --> 03:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and that just does not seem
 
03:34:10.150 --> 03:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
to be the correct level of punishment
 
03:34:12.590 --> 03:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
for adding a little more phosphorus than
 
03:34:15.469 --> 03:34:15.479 align:start position:0%
we want to see especially if it's not if
 
03:34:18.950 --> 03:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
it you know yeah so you don't want to be
 
03:34:20.510 --> 03:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
you don't want to be over fertilizing
 
03:34:21.910 --> 03:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
you don't want to be having this runoff
 
03:34:23.990 --> 03:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's causing cyanobacteria
 
03:34:26.150 --> 03:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
blooms but you shouldn't have this be a
 
03:34:28.030 --> 03:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor so all this bill does is it
 
03:34:29.670 --> 03:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
says that if you're violating this new
 
03:34:32.150 --> 03:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
section that applies to the average
 
03:34:34.309 --> 03:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
everyday Granite Stater it's a violation
 
03:34:38.229 --> 03:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:41.070 --> 03:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor thank you questions from the
 
03:34:44.349 --> 03:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative um I can't
 
03:34:48.309 --> 03:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:50.910 --> 03:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Roy representative s
 
03:34:52.870 --> 03:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
here thank you for taking my question um
 
03:34:54.790 --> 03:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
representative Leon is there evidence of
 
03:34:57.229 --> 03:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
any enforcement of this as it is right
 
03:35:00.070 --> 03:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
now as it stands um so that's a great
 
03:35:01.750 --> 03:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
question it actually came into law back
 
03:35:04.110 --> 03:35:04.120 align:start position:0%
in January 1st is because it has a
 
03:35:05.910 --> 03:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty it wouldn't take effect
 
03:35:08.389 --> 03:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
until the beginning of the year and I
 
03:35:09.910 --> 03:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
don't know about you but it's definitely
 
03:35:12.070 --> 03:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
not fertilizer season at my house with a
 
03:35:14.469 --> 03:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
snow pack over it so nobody's fertilized
 
03:35:17.469 --> 03:35:17.479 align:start position:0%
it yet and it ALS so it also isn't uh
 
03:35:19.830 --> 03:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
online but the question too becomes do
 
03:35:21.790 --> 03:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
we want to have misdemeanor sitting
 
03:35:24.030 --> 03:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
around sprinkled in our statutes that we
 
03:35:26.269 --> 03:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
expect will never be enforced because
 
03:35:27.309 --> 03:35:27.319 align:start position:0%
then you could have selective
 
03:35:28.830 --> 03:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement there's the chance that you
 
03:35:30.630 --> 03:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
may have a neighbor who really really
 
03:35:33.590 --> 03:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
hates you uh and they saw that your
 
03:35:35.269 --> 03:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
fertilizer is the wrong level and so
 
03:35:36.630 --> 03:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
they turn you into the Department of
 
03:35:38.790 --> 03:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and we really shouldn't be
 
03:35:40.910 --> 03:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
getting in the middle of uh neighbor
 
03:35:44.469 --> 03:35:44.479 align:start position:0%
disputes by doing things like that thank
 
03:35:46.830 --> 03:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you man
 
03:35:49.070 --> 03:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
it it seems to me that we shouldn't be
 
03:35:50.870 --> 03:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
getting in the middle of me and Home
 
03:35:53.990 --> 03:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
Depot if I go buy a bag of fertilizer I
 
03:35:55.550 --> 03:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to worry about whether or
 
03:35:59.550 --> 03:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
not um it's a crime right so can you
 
03:36:02.710 --> 03:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
explain to me a little bit what what
 
03:36:04.269 --> 03:36:04.279 align:start position:0%
what this means like if I go buy a
 
03:36:06.630 --> 03:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
fertilizer at Lowe's or Home Depot do I
 
03:36:07.990 --> 03:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that they haven't sold
 
03:36:10.830 --> 03:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
me a product that could be a violation
 
03:36:12.349 --> 03:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question I would hope
 
03:36:14.990 --> 03:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
that Lowe's and Home Depot are had were
 
03:36:16.269 --> 03:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
paying attention into this and are
 
03:36:18.389 --> 03:36:18.399 align:start position:0%
actually selling the correct fertilizer
 
03:36:21.269 --> 03:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
if they aren't I'm fine with them facing
 
03:36:23.950 --> 03:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
those penalties for selling it but your
 
03:36:25.870 --> 03:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
real question is if you live in a Border
 
03:36:27.830 --> 03:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
Town and you don't really care about
 
03:36:29.670 --> 03:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
paying the sales tax in Massachusetts
 
03:36:31.269 --> 03:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
you needed fertilizer on your way home
 
03:36:33.469 --> 03:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
and you buy your fertilizer there you
 
03:36:36.469 --> 03:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
might be buying a legal fertilizer and
 
03:36:37.990 --> 03:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't look you wouldn't expect a
 
03:36:40.630 --> 03:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
check for that yeah
 
03:36:44.550 --> 03:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
okay so this changes any penalty that a
 
03:36:47.070 --> 03:36:47.080 align:start position:0%
homeowner would have to a violation
 
03:36:48.830 --> 03:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you further questions
 
03:36:51.309 --> 03:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
03:36:55.030 --> 03:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
Sher uh given uh that uh the effective
 
03:36:58.030 --> 03:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
date on this is January 1st of 2026
 
03:37:00.189 --> 03:37:00.199 align:start position:0%
might it make more sense to uh change
 
03:37:01.790 --> 03:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
the effective date to when the bill is
 
03:37:04.030 --> 03:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor so that if it's
 
03:37:06.670 --> 03:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
possible that it can be in place for
 
03:37:10.110 --> 03:37:10.120 align:start position:0%
this summer um if it I I would love that
 
03:37:12.150 --> 03:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
if that's possible I this committee
 
03:37:14.189 --> 03:37:14.199 align:start position:0%
deals with the criminal penalties a lot
 
03:37:16.670 --> 03:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
more than I ever have in my experience
 
03:37:19.349 --> 03:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
this is the way it was written by OS but
 
03:37:21.630 --> 03:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
if it's possible to remove a crime
 
03:37:22.950 --> 03:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
without having to wait for the end of
 
03:37:24.670 --> 03:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
the year as opposed to adding a crime
 
03:37:27.070 --> 03:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
which makes sense to wait I I would very
 
03:37:29.469 --> 03:37:29.479 align:start position:0%
be very appreciative to to that friendly
 
03:37:33.870 --> 03:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment such to the uh uh in
 
03:37:36.189 --> 03:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
difference to the chair I I
 
03:37:39.309 --> 03:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
believe uh we can decide when it's going
 
03:37:43.189 --> 03:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
to go be effective it's up to us yeah it
 
03:37:45.550 --> 03:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
will change the effective date to um
 
03:37:45.560 --> 03:37:46.710 align:start position:0%
will change the effective date to um
upon

03:37:46.710 --> 03:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
upon
 
03:37:50.110 --> 03:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
signage any further questions yes repres
 
03:37:51.990 --> 03:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
Murphy Oh Thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:37:53.349 --> 03:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
03:37:56.070 --> 03:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
question if as I'm reading this this
 
03:37:59.630 --> 03:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
only applies to lawn within 25 feet of a
 
03:38:03.910 --> 03:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
storm drain not not um bodies of water I
 
03:38:06.030 --> 03:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
mean there's no question that CYO
 
03:38:08.189 --> 03:38:08.199 align:start position:0%
bacteria is causing a huge issue in the
 
03:38:11.110 --> 03:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
state and lots of cost to to to address
 
03:38:14.870 --> 03:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
that um so is this is just in that
 
03:38:17.469 --> 03:38:17.479 align:start position:0%
particular sit situation are we talking
 
03:38:19.710 --> 03:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
about so those are the governor's words
 
03:38:22.229 --> 03:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
from the governor's veto yeah um when I
 
03:38:27.590 --> 03:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:30.030 --> 03:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
like there we go thank you I look like
 
03:38:33.229 --> 03:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
it could apply more broadly um I I don't
 
03:38:36.110 --> 03:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
know and it's also bodies of water so we
 
03:38:37.990 --> 03:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
have a stream that sometimes runs
 
03:38:40.349 --> 03:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
through our yard because it's seasonal
 
03:38:42.349 --> 03:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
so if it has one of those if somebody
 
03:38:44.030 --> 03:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
determines that something is a rivulet
 
03:38:46.950 --> 03:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
because so much much of the wetlands is
 
03:38:48.950 --> 03:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
really complex and detailed and it's
 
03:38:50.550 --> 03:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
tough for us let alone your average
 
03:38:53.030 --> 03:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
homeowner um the big question I I fully
 
03:38:54.670 --> 03:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
agree with you on the cyanobacteria I
 
03:38:55.590 --> 03:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
believe we were both on the
 
03:38:56.990 --> 03:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
environmentally triggered chronic
 
03:38:59.550 --> 03:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
illness committee together so I
 
03:39:01.070 --> 03:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
understand the need to protect our
 
03:39:02.950 --> 03:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
Waters and to prevent this from going
 
03:39:05.710 --> 03:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
into our Watershed I just don't believe
 
03:39:07.189 --> 03:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
that having a misdemeanor for the
 
03:39:09.510 --> 03:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
individual applying it as opposed to
 
03:39:11.990 --> 03:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
somebody selling that fertilizer is an
 
03:39:14.030 --> 03:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh is an appropriate
 
03:39:14.040 --> 03:39:17.750 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh is an appropriate
punishment

03:39:17.750 --> 03:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:21.349 --> 03:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I'm just thinking in the
 
03:39:23.389 --> 03:39:23.399 align:start position:0%
situation where you might be Lakefront
 
03:39:26.189 --> 03:39:26.199 align:start position:0%
community and a and um your particular
 
03:39:28.670 --> 03:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
lake is the the phosphorus content is
 
03:39:32.229 --> 03:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
increasing and the Ceno bacteria blooms
 
03:39:32.239 --> 03:39:34.030 align:start position:0%
increasing and the Ceno bacteria blooms
um

03:39:34.030 --> 03:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:37.590 --> 03:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
if what would happen if if uh the you
 
03:39:39.429 --> 03:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
know the the particular lakeef fromont
 
03:39:41.309 --> 03:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
Community recognizes that it's
 
03:39:44.030 --> 03:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
fertilizer from you know people's Lawns
 
03:39:46.150 --> 03:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
that are causing it and the request is
 
03:39:48.670 --> 03:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
made to everybody for not to not use a
 
03:39:50.910 --> 03:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
particular uh fertilizer because of the
 
03:39:53.189 --> 03:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
cost to all of the the inability to use
 
03:39:56.590 --> 03:39:56.600 align:start position:0%
the lake um and the risk to Public
 
03:39:59.830 --> 03:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
Health if that's repeated I mean if if
 
03:40:03.070 --> 03:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
people don't comply with that and this
 
03:40:05.510 --> 03:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're exacerbating a problem that we
 
03:40:08.830 --> 03:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
already know is is a is a huge issue do
 
03:40:10.870 --> 03:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
you feel that there should be a a um
 
03:40:12.389 --> 03:40:12.399 align:start position:0%
legal recourse is like just a
 
03:40:14.110 --> 03:40:14.120 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor if people continue to do
 
03:40:16.070 --> 03:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
that or do you
 
03:40:18.110 --> 03:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
um so I'll make up a hypothetical
 
03:40:21.550 --> 03:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
scenario let's say Mr Robert Moneybags
 
03:40:24.469 --> 03:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
lives on the lake in the most expensive
 
03:40:27.150 --> 03:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
house in the state and he really wants
 
03:40:28.790 --> 03:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
his Green Lawn all the way up to the
 
03:40:31.590 --> 03:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
edge and he doesn't care and he puts
 
03:40:33.150 --> 03:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
100% phosphorus would actually kill the
 
03:40:35.389 --> 03:40:35.399 align:start position:0%
grass but he puts whatever high level
 
03:40:35.399 --> 03:40:36.110 align:start position:0%
grass but he puts whatever high level
there

03:40:36.110 --> 03:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:40:38.910 --> 03:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
is there might be an issue on repeated
 
03:40:40.710 --> 03:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
violations because to him that's just
 
03:40:43.389 --> 03:40:43.399 align:start position:0%
the cost of lawn care but especially for
 
03:40:46.429 --> 03:40:46.439 align:start position:0%
a first violation it should be violation
 
03:40:48.590 --> 03:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
maybe on the second or third um to have
 
03:40:50.389 --> 03:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
it be a misdemeanor that would be
 
03:40:53.469 --> 03:40:53.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable but on the first time that
 
03:40:55.349 --> 03:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
that this has come in front of anything
 
03:40:56.750 --> 03:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
I really think that the first one at
 
03:40:58.870 --> 03:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
least needs to be a violation if you
 
03:40:59.910 --> 03:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
believe that it needs to be a
 
03:41:02.630 --> 03:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor after you already had a
 
03:41:04.670 --> 03:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
violation that's something that I that I
 
03:41:07.269 --> 03:41:07.279 align:start position:0%
could live with but I can't live with it
 
03:41:09.429 --> 03:41:09.439 align:start position:0%
being a misdemeanor to put the wrong
 
03:41:11.030 --> 03:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
fertilizer on when you may have bought
 
03:41:14.070 --> 03:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
it in Massachusetts it didn't know any
 
03:41:16.389 --> 03:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
better thank thank you you're
 
03:41:18.630 --> 03:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Murphy if you
 
03:41:21.110 --> 03:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
would like to um get an amendment that
 
03:41:24.790 --> 03:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
changes the effective date and adds a u
 
03:41:26.510 --> 03:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor on the second and third
 
03:41:29.349 --> 03:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
offense or an increased fine for the
 
03:41:31.469 --> 03:41:31.479 align:start position:0%
second and misdemeanor for the third we
 
03:41:35.269 --> 03:41:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:37.750 --> 03:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
Muse in the bill I notice you don't
 
03:41:40.510 --> 03:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
differentiate uh between a homeowner and
 
03:41:42.149 --> 03:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
let's say someone like a landscaping
 
03:41:45.550 --> 03:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
company so uh in your example Mr money
 
03:41:47.750 --> 03:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
bags probably isn't putting his own
 
03:41:49.950 --> 03:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
fertilizer down it's probably somebody
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
else who puts a lot of fertilizer down
 
03:41:55.030 --> 03:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
and a lot of Lawns do you think the law
 
03:41:57.229 --> 03:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
should treat folks like that any
 
03:41:59.349 --> 03:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
differently well thank you that's a good
 
03:42:01.870 --> 03:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
question and you also want to look at
 
03:42:04.110 --> 03:42:04.120 align:start position:0%
sort of the ecosystem of lawn care
 
03:42:05.830 --> 03:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
there's some of the big commercial lawn
 
03:42:08.510 --> 03:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
care companies but there's also I'm
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
encouraging my boys who are here today
 
03:42:11.750 --> 03:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
that maybe they might want to get into
 
03:42:13.349 --> 03:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
lawn care when they're old enough to be
 
03:42:15.630 --> 03:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
doing that and if they're mowing some
 
03:42:17.030 --> 03:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
people's Lawns and they put a little bit
 
03:42:19.349 --> 03:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
too much fertilizer I would say them or
 
03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
some of the people in my community where
 
03:42:24.389 --> 03:42:24.399 align:start position:0%
there's one a oneman landscaping uh
 
03:42:27.429 --> 03:42:27.439 align:start position:0%
business or a Twan landscaping business
 
03:42:28.750 --> 03:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't be treated the same
 
03:42:30.229 --> 03:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
way as the large one if we added a
 
03:42:32.269 --> 03:42:32.279 align:start position:0%
penalty we're on the second or where you
 
03:42:35.030 --> 03:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
escalated the fine on the second and
 
03:42:37.389 --> 03:42:37.399 align:start position:0%
then made it a misdemeanor on the third
 
03:42:38.870 --> 03:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
then you're looking at an issue where a
 
03:42:40.750 --> 03:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
large company that's doing this across
 
03:42:42.389 --> 03:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
the state and doing it on lots of Mr
 
03:42:44.950 --> 03:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
Moneybags properties um would still have
 
03:42:46.429 --> 03:42:46.439 align:start position:0%
to comply and they'd be dealing with the
 
03:42:48.070 --> 03:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors but we'd be letting the
 
03:42:50.630 --> 03:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
average citizen um have a softer hand
 
03:42:55.309 --> 03:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:58.149 --> 03:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
you U representative Harry
 
03:43:01.110 --> 03:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
gather thank you for taking my question
 
03:43:04.030 --> 03:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
um did did you have any data that this
 
03:43:06.189 --> 03:43:06.199 align:start position:0%
is this is actually a problem
 
03:43:08.389 --> 03:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
here um thank you for the question we
 
03:43:10.149 --> 03:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
just overrode the governor's veto back
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
in October and it's not fertilizing
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
season yet so nobody's had the
 
03:43:17.550 --> 03:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to over fertilize yet but I
 
03:43:19.349 --> 03:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
I have a big problem with laws that are
 
03:43:21.149 --> 03:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
on the books that would that have the
 
03:43:22.870 --> 03:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
potential to be selectively enforced
 
03:43:25.349 --> 03:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
especially with criminal penalties um I
 
03:43:26.950 --> 03:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
think that that just invites the
 
03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity for misuse um
 
03:43:32.950 --> 03:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
and I I think that having that having
 
03:43:34.590 --> 03:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
laws that are selectively enforced with
 
03:43:37.469 --> 03:43:37.479 align:start position:0%
a high penalty like a misdemeanor is
 
03:43:37.479 --> 03:43:38.630 align:start position:0%
a high penalty like a misdemeanor is
really

03:43:38.630 --> 03:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:43:42.630 --> 03:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:45.550 --> 03:43:45.560 align:start position:0%
you thank you one last question
 
03:43:48.389 --> 03:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
um right now is Dees the enforcement
 
03:43:50.510 --> 03:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
Authority and would that be the same for
 
03:43:54.389 --> 03:43:54.399 align:start position:0%
this or I just I just recognize the the
 
03:43:56.309 --> 03:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
challenges we've had in in terms of
 
03:43:58.510 --> 03:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
availability of Staffing just to even
 
03:44:00.950 --> 03:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
test foro bacteria at our our Lakes
 
03:44:04.070 --> 03:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
because of of Staffing for dees are they
 
03:44:06.110 --> 03:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
the persons that would be responsible
 
03:44:08.550 --> 03:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
for well um so while I have some
 
03:44:10.590 --> 03:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
editorial questions about the governor
 
03:44:12.309 --> 03:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
saying that it's only within the 25 ft
 
03:44:13.990 --> 03:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
in The veto message he says that the
 
03:44:15.830 --> 03:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture reports that
 
03:44:17.149 --> 03:44:17.159 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of the law would be
 
03:44:18.830 --> 03:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
entirely relying on neighbors telling
 
03:44:20.309 --> 03:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
neighbors because they don't have the
 
03:44:22.510 --> 03:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
people to staff to go around and ask to
 
03:44:25.309 --> 03:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
see your bag and see what the phosphorus
 
03:44:27.429 --> 03:44:27.439 align:start position:0%
content is so it would be Department of
 
03:44:28.670 --> 03:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and you're right we're
 
03:44:30.349 --> 03:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
already asking our agencies to do a lot
 
03:44:31.750 --> 03:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
of things and there's a lot of really
 
03:44:32.910 --> 03:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
important things that we need
 
03:44:34.950 --> 03:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
agriculture to do that this would be
 
03:44:37.189 --> 03:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
taking away from their larger
 
03:44:39.269 --> 03:44:39.279 align:start position:0%
Mission but if you had somebody who's a
 
03:44:41.830 --> 03:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
repeat violator at that point when when
 
03:44:44.590 --> 03:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
the Moneybags grass company keeps doing
 
03:44:46.149 --> 03:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
this around the state that becomes a
 
03:44:48.670 --> 03:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
high priority because it's a repeated
 
03:44:51.110 --> 03:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
issue and and it does say they are
 
03:44:52.870 --> 03:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
personally or through an agent so I
 
03:44:55.110 --> 03:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
would think the agent would be the
 
03:44:58.309 --> 03:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
company or or that's my that's my
 
03:45:00.389 --> 03:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
intention thank you just to be clear we
 
03:45:01.510 --> 03:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
don't have anything against the
 
03:45:03.429 --> 03:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
Moneybags company per
 
03:45:06.070 --> 03:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
se representative uh Murray would like
 
03:45:07.670 --> 03:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
to read something that will clarify this
 
03:45:10.110 --> 03:45:10.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit for us from the statue yes
 
03:45:12.269 --> 03:45:12.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I pulled up an
 
03:45:14.229 --> 03:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
official notice from the Department of
 
03:45:15.910 --> 03:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
Agriculture that they put out this past
 
03:45:19.030 --> 03:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
December so it says restrictions for the
 
03:45:21.269 --> 03:45:21.279 align:start position:0%
use of turf fertilizer for homeowners
 
03:45:23.990 --> 03:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
and Commercial users and then it says it
 
03:45:26.269 --> 03:45:26.279 align:start position:0%
prohibits application within 25 ft of
 
03:45:28.149 --> 03:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
water or storm drains or where it can
 
03:45:31.030 --> 03:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
enter storm drains application during or
 
03:45:33.389 --> 03:45:33.399 align:start position:0%
immediately before heavy rain
 
03:45:35.149 --> 03:45:35.159 align:start position:0%
application where grass is not actively
 
03:45:37.309 --> 03:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
growing including frozen ground and
 
03:45:39.630 --> 03:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
impervious services and then it lists
 
03:45:42.630 --> 03:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
the rsas gives people a list um or a
 
03:45:45.070 --> 03:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
link to go look for more information and
 
03:45:48.349 --> 03:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
it also has a great description of um
 
03:45:50.469 --> 03:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
going over the basics of cyanobacteria
 
03:45:52.269 --> 03:45:52.279 align:start position:0%
so that hopefully you know when people
 
03:45:54.149 --> 03:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
get this notice they have a full picture
 
03:45:57.550 --> 03:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
of what they're supposed to do and
 
03:46:00.349 --> 03:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
why thank you that's helpful any further
 
03:46:02.990 --> 03:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
questions for the sponsor seeing none
 
03:46:07.110 --> 03:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:18.389 --> 03:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:20.630 --> 03:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
good afternoon committee chair and
 
03:46:22.950 --> 03:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
members of the uh criminal justice

my committee last year and and sort of I
 
03:46:53.269 --> 03:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
guess as an
 
03:46:57.110 --> 03:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
oversight uh I we were not aware of the
 
03:47:00.469 --> 03:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties being so so Stern so
 
03:47:04.149 --> 03:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
I do support um making this a violation
 
03:47:07.110 --> 03:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
as opposed to misdemeanor and U that's
 
03:47:08.870 --> 03:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
really all I wanted to come and say and
 
03:47:11.149 --> 03:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
I reiterate and support everything that
 
03:47:13.510 --> 03:47:13.520 align:start position:0%

representative Lon had just laid out to
you

03:47:15.149 --> 03:47:15.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:47:16.550 --> 03:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate it and the work
 
03:47:17.870 --> 03:47:17.880 align:start position:0%

Forward um any questions seeing none
 
03:47:25.790 --> 03:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:33.630 --> 03:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:38.550 --> 03:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
boys I think that it if if that if
 
03:47:41.710 --> 03:47:41.720 align:start position:0%
putting INF fertilizer on wrong is on
 
03:47:45.189 --> 03:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
the same level of a DUI which is is from
 
03:47:48.269 --> 03:47:48.279 align:start position:0%
something that can actually kill
 
03:47:51.269 --> 03:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
someone that something needs to change
 
03:47:54.269 --> 03:47:54.279 align:start position:0%
with that law and it needs to uh be a
 
03:47:56.790 --> 03:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
much lower and it needs to be in a a
 
03:47:59.830 --> 03:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
lower category than
 
03:48:02.229 --> 03:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
that thank you what do you think the
 
03:48:03.990 --> 03:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
punishment should
 
03:48:04.000 --> 03:48:05.710 align:start position:0%
punishment should
be

03:48:05.710 --> 03:48:05.720 align:start position:0%

you good good afternoon happy Friday to
 
03:49:04.469 --> 03:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
you all I know you've had a busy long
 
03:49:07.309 --> 03:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
week uh I'm Andrea Laro the president
 
03:49:09.349 --> 03:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
and policy advocate for New Hampshire
 
03:49:13.149 --> 03:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
lakes and I'm here today um technically
 
03:49:15.550 --> 03:49:15.560 align:start position:0%
to speak to oppose this belill but to
 
03:49:18.429 --> 03:49:18.439 align:start position:0%
oppose it as it's written um and I've
 
03:49:20.269 --> 03:49:20.279 align:start position:0%
been really encouraged by all the
 
03:49:22.630 --> 03:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
discussion that has been happening thus
 
03:49:27.750 --> 03:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
far um and we would agree that um it
 
03:49:30.269 --> 03:49:30.279 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate to downgrade um the
 
03:49:32.950 --> 03:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
penalties um you know violation seems
 
03:49:35.070 --> 03:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate what we're concerned about
 
03:49:37.630 --> 03:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
and you may have seen online about 150
 
03:49:40.550 --> 03:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
folks from The Late Community Road in uh
 
03:49:42.469 --> 03:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
we would like to see that there is some
 
03:49:45.950 --> 03:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
sort of fine um attached to this for
 
03:49:48.750 --> 03:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
just what's been mentioned the repeated
 
03:49:51.990 --> 03:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
knowing um you know violation of the law
 
03:49:53.870 --> 03:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
and I I really appreciate the thoughtful
 
03:49:57.750 --> 03:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
discussion and your concerns about
 
03:50:00.269 --> 03:50:00.279 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria so I'd be happy to answer
 
03:50:02.790 --> 03:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
any questions and it would be really um
 
03:50:04.630 --> 03:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
supportive of an amendment to what's
 
03:50:04.640 --> 03:50:05.990 align:start position:0%
supportive of an amendment to what's
been

03:50:05.990 --> 03:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:50:08.429 --> 03:50:08.439 align:start position:0%
discussed as the concern from your
 
03:50:11.229 --> 03:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
Association that you may have um an
 
03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
owner who just doesn't really care and
 
03:50:15.110 --> 03:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
just has the money to afford a little
 
03:50:16.910 --> 03:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
fine we'll just keep ignoring it is that
 
03:50:18.590 --> 03:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
pretty much that is the concern and
 
03:50:20.590 --> 03:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we do see that type of
 
03:50:22.790 --> 03:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
behavior throughout the state and we're
 
03:50:24.630 --> 03:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
concerned that if it's a violation with
 
03:50:27.469 --> 03:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
really no deterrent um that you know it
 
03:50:29.990 --> 03:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
kind of doesn't really have any teeth
 
03:50:31.990 --> 03:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
well we will we will add some Dentures
 
03:50:33.950 --> 03:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Dentures thank you so much and
 
03:50:35.429 --> 03:50:35.439 align:start position:0%

03:50:37.229 --> 03:50:37.239 align:start position:0%

04:35:15.390 --> 04:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
going to be representative Murphy and
 
04:35:15.400 --> 04:35:19.629 align:start position:0%
going to be representative Murphy and
representative

04:35:19.629 --> 04:35:19.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:22.830 --> 04:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
rhods uh good afternoon uh Mr chair and
 
04:35:24.429 --> 04:35:24.439 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
04:35:26.830 --> 04:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
Pamela kyg and I am the public policy
 
04:35:28.029 --> 04:35:28.039 align:start position:0%
specialist at the New Hampshire
 
04:35:29.949 --> 04:35:29.959 align:start position:0%
Coalition against Domestic and Sexual
 
04:35:32.629 --> 04:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
Violence um I'm here to speak in support
 
04:35:36.390 --> 04:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
of HB 218 um as you heard from the
 
04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
sponsor this bill updates RSA 21 m8k the
 
04:35:42.269 --> 04:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
status uh the statute governing the
 
04:35:44.349 --> 04:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
rights of Crime Victims in New Hampshire
 
04:35:46.629 --> 04:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
and would allow uh victims of crime to
 
04:35:48.629 --> 04:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
access their police reports for free at
 
04:35:51.269 --> 04:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
the completion of an investigation um I
 
04:35:52.949 --> 04:35:52.959 align:start position:0%
think it's just this is an important
 
04:35:54.910 --> 04:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
policy because Crime Victims should not
 
04:35:56.429 --> 04:35:56.439 align:start position:0%
have to foot the bill to receive the
 
04:35:59.070 --> 04:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
police report in their own case um just
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
a quick point of clarification to um
 
04:36:05.310 --> 04:36:05.320 align:start position:0%
this um St uh this bill wouldn't
 
04:36:07.830 --> 04:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
conflict with any other statute um and
 
04:36:11.709 --> 04:36:11.719 align:start position:0%
then also under 91a um the victims
 
04:36:13.869 --> 04:36:13.879 align:start position:0%
already um have access to their police
 
04:36:15.830 --> 04:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
report um but with this bill they
 
04:36:18.750 --> 04:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be charged um so this shouldn't
 
04:36:22.109 --> 04:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
add any major changes to our state law
 
04:36:24.830 --> 04:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
um so I think something I just wanted to
 
04:36:26.029 --> 04:36:26.039 align:start position:0%
highlight and I'll keep this brief
 
04:36:27.109 --> 04:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
because I know there's going to be a
 
04:36:29.910 --> 04:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
step study committee um but victims
 
04:36:31.830 --> 04:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
often need copies of police reports to
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
access um services and their rights um
 
04:36:36.590 --> 04:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
and this could include filing an
 
04:36:39.510 --> 04:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
insurance claim use in legal proceedings
 
04:36:40.750 --> 04:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh requesting assistance through
 
04:36:43.029 --> 04:36:43.039 align:start position:0%
victim's compensation programs um for
 
04:36:44.510 --> 04:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
employers to meet eligibility
 
04:36:46.510 --> 04:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
requirements and also landlord tenant
 
04:36:49.150 --> 04:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
matters as well as other things um and
 
04:36:51.029 --> 04:36:51.039 align:start position:0%
so this means that a victim's ability to
 
04:36:52.910 --> 04:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
receive their police report in a timely
 
04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
manner can have a direct impact on their
 
04:36:56.990 --> 04:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
ability to meaningfully access their
 
04:36:58.910 --> 04:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
statutory rights as well as the
 
04:37:00.949 --> 04:37:00.959 align:start position:0%
assistance they are entitled um as a
 
04:37:02.109 --> 04:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
result of their
 
04:37:04.470 --> 04:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
victimization um and I think passing
 
04:37:06.349 --> 04:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
this bill will eliminate an unnecessary
 
04:37:08.070 --> 04:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
cost to victims in New Hampshire and
 
04:37:11.070 --> 04:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
offset the cost of abuse in general um
 
04:37:13.070 --> 04:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to work with uh the
 
04:37:14.670 --> 04:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill and our our
 
04:37:17.310 --> 04:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the back um to fine-tune
 
04:37:19.230 --> 04:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
the bill just to make sure that um it
 
04:37:21.189 --> 04:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
works with all parties involved so thank
 
04:37:23.070 --> 04:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
you so much and I'm happy to answer any
 
04:37:25.990 --> 04:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um I meant to ask
 
04:37:29.189 --> 04:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
the sponsor this but it seems to me 60
 
04:37:30.990 --> 04:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
days is an awful long time to have to
 
04:37:32.830 --> 04:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
wait for a report and maybe the
 
04:37:34.869 --> 04:37:34.879 align:start position:0%
subcommittee can look into if there's a
 
04:37:36.551 --> 04:37:36.561 align:start position:0%
specific reason why law enforcement
 
04:37:38.949 --> 04:37:38.959 align:start position:0%
needed that much time um but I would
 
04:37:40.230 --> 04:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
think that we could do it quicker than
 
04:37:42.189 --> 04:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
that uh repres representative uh
 
04:37:44.310 --> 04:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative Sher uh would you have
 
04:37:46.949 --> 04:37:46.959 align:start position:0%
any problem with well my concern a
 
04:37:49.150 --> 04:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
language concern there's no such thing
 
04:37:52.750 --> 04:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
in a case as a police report every case
 
04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
has a whole bunch of police reports so
 
04:37:58.869 --> 04:37:58.879 align:start position:0%
for the subcommittee's purpose I think
 
04:38:01.029 --> 04:38:01.039 align:start position:0%
it'd be better do you think it would be
 
04:38:03.709 --> 04:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
better to read uh be provided with a
 
04:38:07.349 --> 04:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
copy of a complete set of police reports
 
04:38:11.590 --> 04:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
in the case that would better
 
04:38:13.789 --> 04:38:13.799 align:start position:0%
characterize the circumstance otherwise
 
04:38:14.910 --> 04:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
some police departments are going to
 
04:38:16.349 --> 04:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
read this
 
04:38:19.830 --> 04:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
as okay we need to get one police report
 
04:38:20.990 --> 04:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
yeah no thank you so much for the
 
04:38:23.269 --> 04:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
question and I know um someone from the
 
04:38:24.990 --> 04:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
state police is here and I think they
 
04:38:26.189 --> 04:38:26.199 align:start position:0%
could speak to that and we can
 
04:38:28.109 --> 04:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
definitely look at making sure the
 
04:38:32.070 --> 04:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
language is um very clear so thank you
 
04:38:34.949 --> 04:38:34.959 align:start position:0%
any further questions seeing none thank
 
04:38:37.150 --> 04:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:47.670 --> 04:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
you didn't get promoted D you're still
 
04:38:51.629 --> 04:38:51.639 align:start position:0%
major right yes okay I have no interest
 
04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:57.990 --> 04:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
so all I appreciate you hearing my
 
04:38:59.990 --> 04:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
testimony uh just for the record my name
 
04:39:01.949 --> 04:39:01.959 align:start position:0%
is Bill brigh I am a major with the New
 
04:39:05.070 --> 04:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police um we um are in
 
04:39:07.629 --> 04:39:07.639 align:start position:0%
support of uh you know the idea of this
 
04:39:10.150 --> 04:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
bill and and uh providing reports to
 
04:39:13.029 --> 04:39:13.039 align:start position:0%
victims uh at no cost um the
 
04:39:16.709 --> 04:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
conversations that we've had um kind of
 
04:39:19.349 --> 04:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh fall under more like the the more
 
04:39:22.470 --> 04:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
sizable reports so as you know uh cases
 
04:39:25.150 --> 04:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
come in all different shapes and sizes
 
04:39:28.789 --> 04:39:28.799 align:start position:0%
um so if you think of a homicide case
 
04:39:31.830 --> 04:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
that may include you know 10,000 40,000
 
04:39:35.510 --> 04:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
pages of of documents may include uh
 
04:39:38.830 --> 04:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
digital files um you know whether that's
 
04:39:43.868 --> 04:39:43.878 align:start position:0%
audio video um surve video and so we're
 
04:39:45.350 --> 04:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
just looking to clarify with the
 
04:39:48.510 --> 04:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
representative and the subcommittee um
 
04:39:51.550 --> 04:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
how that would actually work what was
 
04:39:53.990 --> 04:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
what is what is required what's needed
 
04:39:55.788 --> 04:39:55.798 align:start position:0%
and then uh what it would take to
 
04:39:57.430 --> 04:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
provide that so to answer your question
 
04:40:00.830 --> 04:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
about the 60 days that is that is a uh
 
04:40:03.190 --> 04:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
you know a lengthy time for a small
 
04:40:06.990 --> 04:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
report but the reality is for a a large
 
04:40:09.470 --> 04:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
report we may need more time so I'm not
 
04:40:10.910 --> 04:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
sure what the wording should be or if we
 
04:40:12.510 --> 04:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
should stick stick with the 60 days but
 
04:40:14.948 --> 04:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
we're we're willing to work uh with the
 
04:40:17.868 --> 04:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
committee to to come up with a good uh a
 
04:40:20.788 --> 04:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
good bill that to come out of it perhaps
 
04:40:22.990 --> 04:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
a standard time with a relief valve
 
04:40:25.270 --> 04:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
where if it because I was just thinking
 
04:40:25.280 --> 04:40:26.150 align:start position:0%
where if it because I was just thinking
yeah

04:40:26.150 --> 04:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:40:28.948 --> 04:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
redactions uh a lengthy homicide Report
 
04:40:30.750 --> 04:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
with redactions could take 60 days just
 
04:40:33.470 --> 04:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
to get that squared away yeah under the
 
04:40:35.868 --> 04:40:35.878 align:start position:0%
91a uh request that we get for the
 
04:40:38.788 --> 04:40:38.798 align:start position:0%
larger cases we it's often uh much
 
04:40:40.670 --> 04:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
longer than 60 days for us to provide
 
04:40:42.868 --> 04:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
that for those reasons yeah providing
 
04:40:45.310 --> 04:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
redactions of thousands of pages uh can
 
04:40:47.310 --> 04:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
take some time okay all right well I'll
 
04:40:48.830 --> 04:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
leave it to the subcommittee to to work
 
04:40:50.670 --> 04:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
with you to figure that out excellent
 
04:40:53.550 --> 04:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
thank you yes go
 
04:40:57.470 --> 04:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
ahead yes thanks for taking my question
 
04:41:02.110 --> 04:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
um does the right to no law cover police
 
04:41:05.190 --> 04:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
reports yes
 
04:41:09.708 --> 04:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
so would a victim have more rights to
 
04:41:13.628 --> 04:41:13.638 align:start position:0%
police reports than the average citizen
 
04:41:15.670 --> 04:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh not necessarily under the under the
 
04:41:18.868 --> 04:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
91a law I don't believe so uh which I
 
04:41:21.350 --> 04:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
think is the you know the intention of
 
04:41:24.670 --> 04:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
this bill okay
 
04:41:29.030 --> 04:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
so uh followup y so what we're what
 
04:41:32.788 --> 04:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
we're doing with this bill is giving the
 
04:41:35.590 --> 04:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
the victim additional
 
04:41:38.868 --> 04:41:38.878 align:start position:0%
rights above and beyond the right to no
 
04:41:41.830 --> 04:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
law yes there some I guess an
 
04:41:43.868 --> 04:41:43.878 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement that uh those reports
 
04:41:47.910 --> 04:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
will be provided at no cost okay thank
 
04:41:50.590 --> 04:41:50.600 align:start position:0%
you yeah just so my understanding is
 
04:41:51.910 --> 04:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
that it really doesn't give them any
 
04:41:54.070 --> 04:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
more rights it just charges it just
 
04:41:57.910 --> 04:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
waves the fee okay and and it it's it
 
04:41:59.708 --> 04:41:59.718 align:start position:0%
might shorten a time frame yeah every
 
04:42:01.350 --> 04:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
agency is different I believe under the
 
04:42:05.550 --> 04:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
91a law um you can be charged to receive
 
04:42:08.030 --> 04:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
those reports um but not every agency
 
04:42:10.910 --> 04:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
does that um it depends on on the case
 
04:42:15.030 --> 04:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
too and and what it takes to to provide
 
04:42:17.590 --> 04:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
it yeah exactly I imagine an accident
 
04:42:20.628 --> 04:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
report versus a you know B and E there'
 
04:42:22.590 --> 04:42:22.600 align:start position:0%
be a big difference correct okay thank
 
04:42:26.110 --> 04:42:26.120 align:start position:0%

8 as a quick overview this bill is to
 
04:59:55.350 --> 04:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
address a uh an issue a persistent issue
 
04:59:57.670 --> 04:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
that we've heard um in the resources
 
05:00:00.548 --> 05:00:00.558 align:start position:0%
committee um on during numerous uh
 
05:00:03.470 --> 05:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
public hearings which is that uh the
 
05:00:06.270 --> 05:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
lack of Marine Patrol on New Hampshire's
 
05:00:09.350 --> 05:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
water bodies as some background that I
 
05:00:10.910 --> 05:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
think some people people are familiar
 
05:00:14.430 --> 05:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
with the the um outdoor tourism in New
 
05:00:16.150 --> 05:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a significant State
 
05:00:19.150 --> 05:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
industry it brings um tourism in general
 
05:00:21.390 --> 05:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
brings in over 325 million annually in
 
05:00:23.628 --> 05:00:23.638 align:start position:0%
tax revenue and outdoor tourism
 
05:00:25.628 --> 05:00:25.638 align:start position:0%
specifically brings in 3.9 billion to
 
05:00:28.150 --> 05:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
the state economy we have over a
 
05:00:30.230 --> 05:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
thousand public lakes and ponds and
 
05:00:32.590 --> 05:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
that's a which are a major public uh
 
05:00:34.788 --> 05:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
summer tourist
 
05:00:37.310 --> 05:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
attraction we've heard numerous uh Lake
 
05:00:40.230 --> 05:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
related bills in resources um and 's a
 
05:00:42.990 --> 05:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
common theme across many of these from
 
05:00:45.510 --> 05:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh from both sides of on many of the
 
05:00:47.150 --> 05:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
positions which is that there's not
 
05:00:48.350 --> 05:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
enough Marine
 
05:00:52.150 --> 05:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
Patrol my own story is that I've had a
 
05:00:54.788 --> 05:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
uh camp on lake monomac in ringe which
 
05:00:56.750 --> 05:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
is right on the Massachusetts border for
 
05:00:59.750 --> 05:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
about 10 years um when we first were
 
05:01:01.470 --> 05:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
there every weekend we would see Marine
 
05:01:04.270 --> 05:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
Patrol on the water body um just sitting
 
05:01:06.510 --> 05:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
there very rarely issuing teates but
 
05:01:10.750 --> 05:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
making sure that um that uh
 
05:01:13.110 --> 05:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
that uh boating was safe um the
 
05:01:14.628 --> 05:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
Recreations on the lake were safe and
 
05:01:16.990 --> 05:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
that the lake could be enjoyed by
 
05:01:19.548 --> 05:01:19.558 align:start position:0%
all uh over the years that's diminished
 
05:01:21.830 --> 05:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
until last year I didn't we didn't see
 
05:01:23.948 --> 05:01:23.958 align:start position:0%
um Marine Patrol a single day on our
 
05:01:27.470 --> 05:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
Lake what we saw instead was outrageous
 
05:01:29.470 --> 05:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
behavior like jet skis jumping over the
 
05:01:32.190 --> 05:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
wakes uh directly behind wake Surfers
 
05:01:35.110 --> 05:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
unregistered watercraft ski craft coming
 
05:01:36.948 --> 05:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
from the Massachusetts portion of the B
 
05:01:38.868 --> 05:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
of the water which are not permitted on
 
05:01:40.390 --> 05:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire side
 
05:01:42.070 --> 05:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
and out of state voters that didn't
 
05:01:44.390 --> 05:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
carry the invasive species decal that
 
05:01:47.070 --> 05:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
helps offset the costs of uh invas
 
05:01:49.430 --> 05:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
fighting invasive species in New
 
05:01:51.990 --> 05:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of course the vast majority of
 
05:01:54.830 --> 05:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
of boter are responsible and as we hear
 
05:01:56.470 --> 05:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
again and again Ed education is
 
05:01:59.628 --> 05:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
essential informing V informing
 
05:02:04.470 --> 05:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
violators of the of the infractions uh
 
05:02:05.708 --> 05:02:05.718 align:start position:0%
prevents them in the future and
 
05:02:07.750 --> 05:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
oftentimes education's enough tickets
 
05:02:11.230 --> 05:02:11.240 align:start position:0%
don't even need to be issued
 
05:02:13.390 --> 05:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
um and as we've all seen people are more
 
05:02:14.990 --> 05:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
responsible when law enforcement is
 
05:02:18.310 --> 05:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
present we've all seen uh police police
 
05:02:20.150 --> 05:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
car on the side of the road people slow
 
05:02:22.470 --> 05:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
down people are um people don't run stop
 
05:02:24.070 --> 05:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
lights for
 
05:02:26.510 --> 05:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
example ultimately conflicts on the lake
 
05:02:30.350 --> 05:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
can be minimized if we um and we can
 
05:02:31.910 --> 05:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
have better balance for the multiple
 
05:02:34.270 --> 05:02:34.280 align:start position:0%
uses of the public waterways with just
 
05:02:36.110 --> 05:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
the presence of Marine
 
05:02:39.310 --> 05:02:39.320 align:start position:0%
Patrol funding is not the issue there's
 
05:02:42.190 --> 05:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh numerous positions um in in Marine
 
05:02:44.430 --> 05:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
Patrol go unfunded every year and this
 
05:02:46.750 --> 05:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
is particularly uh uh true of the
 
05:02:50.270 --> 05:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
seasonal positions um in the summer um
 
05:02:52.350 --> 05:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
recruiting is also not the problem uh
 
05:02:53.750 --> 05:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety has extensive
 
05:02:55.910 --> 05:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
programs to recruit staff for multiple
 
05:02:59.110 --> 05:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
sources colleges um and uh number of
 
05:03:01.430 --> 05:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
other sources and other people have
 
05:03:02.910 --> 05:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
suggested that training might be the
 
05:03:05.350 --> 05:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
problem but there is no magic bullet
 
05:03:07.230 --> 05:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
I've to spoke to many members of the
 
05:03:09.150 --> 05:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety including assistant
 
05:03:10.470 --> 05:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner Ed
 
05:03:12.548 --> 05:03:12.558 align:start position:0%
and there's if there was a bill that we
 
05:03:13.788 --> 05:03:13.798 align:start position:0%
could bring forward that would solve
 
05:03:15.430 --> 05:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
this problem more money as many people
 
05:03:16.948 --> 05:03:16.958 align:start position:0%
have suggested of course that's what we
 
05:03:18.190 --> 05:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
would have brought forward but that's
 
05:03:19.548 --> 05:03:19.558 align:start position:0%
not what the issue
 
05:03:23.030 --> 05:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
is originally I had int planned for a
 
05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
study committee um I was on a study
 
05:03:27.390 --> 05:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
committee over the summer to study
 
05:03:29.470 --> 05:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
fishing game Partnerships and I found
 
05:03:31.430 --> 05:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
that there was great bipartisan uh
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
collaboration and we heard from a broad
 
05:03:35.990 --> 05:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh a broad set of
 
05:03:38.590 --> 05:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders but when I spoke to uh
 
05:03:40.350 --> 05:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner Edwards he
 
05:03:43.350 --> 05:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
suggested a task force instead said that
 
05:03:45.830 --> 05:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
um the they had success with past task
 
05:03:49.750 --> 05:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
force task forces and that they had some
 
05:03:53.910 --> 05:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
suggestions on on uh they wanted some
 
05:03:55.910 --> 05:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
time to think about some suggestions for
 
05:03:58.230 --> 05:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
legislation they could bring forward
 
05:04:00.670 --> 05:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
task force are public meetings as well
 
05:04:02.750 --> 05:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
legislators can attend um provide
 
05:04:05.230 --> 05:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
comments the public can it as well
 
05:04:08.470 --> 05:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately the goal is um uh for the
 
05:04:10.830 --> 05:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
task force to um to Pro propose
 
05:04:13.788 --> 05:04:13.798 align:start position:0%
legislation that we can evaluate um to
 
05:04:15.910 --> 05:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
increase law enforcement patrols on New
 
05:04:16.990 --> 05:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire water
 
05:04:19.110 --> 05:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
bodies the question that some people
 
05:04:21.230 --> 05:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
might ask is is this bill actually
 
05:04:23.230 --> 05:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
necessary can't the department of safety
 
05:04:25.470 --> 05:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
just do this on their own I'd answer
 
05:04:26.750 --> 05:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
that by saying the problem is getting
 
05:04:28.670 --> 05:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
worse every year like I described
 
05:04:31.750 --> 05:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
earlier and there's an outcry of users
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
um across um of the variety of users
 
05:04:37.070 --> 05:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
that use the Lakes both Lake
 
05:04:39.270 --> 05:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
Associations on social media and at
 
05:04:42.190 --> 05:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
public hearings ultimately I think that
 
05:04:44.070 --> 05:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
the department safety would benefit from
 
05:04:46.230 --> 05:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
Direction by the legislature to address
 
05:04:49.868 --> 05:04:49.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:52.310 --> 05:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
Patrol why is it a multi- agency task
 
05:04:54.868 --> 05:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
force well there's other agencies that
 
05:04:56.470 --> 05:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
have responsibilities both for
 
05:04:58.510 --> 05:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
patrolling as well as protecting New
 
05:05:00.910 --> 05:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire water bodies fishing game for
 
05:05:03.350 --> 05:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
example RSA uh
 
05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
20626 um paragraph 11 talks about um uh
 
05:05:11.670 --> 05:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
the two enforce the laws relating to
 
05:05:14.030 --> 05:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
amongst other thing boats they also have
 
05:05:16.390 --> 05:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
broad enforcement UH responsibilities
 
05:05:19.628 --> 05:05:19.638 align:start position:0%
including the uh uh ability to enforce
 
05:05:22.548 --> 05:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
all provisions of RSA title uh 21
 
05:05:24.990 --> 05:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
relative to Motor Vehicle Laws why the
 
05:05:26.430 --> 05:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
05:05:28.948 --> 05:05:28.958 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services because they run
 
05:05:31.430 --> 05:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
the um a program called the New
 
05:05:32.910 --> 05:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes management Protection
 
05:05:35.230 --> 05:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
Program the summary of that is that it
 
05:05:37.830 --> 05:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
was created by the legislature to um as
 
05:05:40.110 --> 05:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
a result of the recognition of competing
 
05:05:44.830 --> 05:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
uses of the state surface waters um to
 
05:05:48.030 --> 05:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
to um make sure that biological social
 
05:05:51.670 --> 05:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:54.750 --> 05:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
protected ultim um this will also engage
 
05:05:57.070 --> 05:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders and experts Municipal
 
05:05:59.270 --> 05:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
and County Law Enforcement that protect
 
05:06:03.030 --> 05:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
water uh Public Safety on lakes um as
 
05:06:05.430 --> 05:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
well as um other Representatives like
 
05:06:07.470 --> 05:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
Marine trades New Hampshire lakes and
 
05:06:09.030 --> 05:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
the Len preservation committee I have
 
05:06:10.310 --> 05:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
spoken to most most of those groups and
 
05:06:13.910 --> 05:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:17.230 --> 05:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
us the qu the question that this task
 
05:06:18.830 --> 05:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
force would be answering is what are the
 
05:06:21.548 --> 05:06:21.558 align:start position:0%
needs for law enforcement patrols and
 
05:06:23.910 --> 05:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
how can those needs be met by maximizing
 
05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
the available resources federal dollars
 
05:06:28.070 --> 05:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
are also of
 
05:06:30.510 --> 05:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
question is there being is there being
 
05:06:32.350 --> 05:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
money left on the table because of the
 
05:06:35.150 --> 05:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
unfulfilled positions unfilled positions
 
05:06:37.788 --> 05:06:37.798 align:start position:0%
which has been is is a refrain I've
 
05:06:41.190 --> 05:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
heard as well over all and to summarize
 
05:06:42.750 --> 05:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
um the intent of this bill is for
 
05:06:44.670 --> 05:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
experts to provide recommendations on
 
05:06:46.030 --> 05:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
how to address the problem of
 
05:06:48.430 --> 05:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
insufficient Marine patrols so residents
 
05:06:50.510 --> 05:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
and tourists can fully enjoy New

Associations we're here to speak in
 
05:08:05.390 --> 05:08:05.400 align:start position:0%

05:08:08.030 --> 05:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
if you went to the online um testimony
 
05:08:10.150 --> 05:08:10.160 align:start position:0%

05:08:12.030 --> 05:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
Lake residents and Lake Association
 
05:08:14.510 --> 05:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
members uh are urging you to support
 
05:08:16.628 --> 05:08:16.638 align:start position:0%
this bill for many of the reasons that
 
05:08:19.548 --> 05:08:19.558 align:start position:0%
representative Darby uh just said I have
 
05:08:21.830 --> 05:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
been um working with lakes and Lake
 
05:08:23.430 --> 05:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
management and preservation here in New
 
05:08:26.430 --> 05:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since 2001 I started over at
 
05:08:29.270 --> 05:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
05:08:33.590 --> 05:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
and the biggest um thing I hear uh that
 
05:08:36.390 --> 05:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
I've heard from our constituents um over
 
05:08:39.830 --> 05:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
the years is uh where is Marine Patrol
 
05:08:41.548 --> 05:08:41.558 align:start position:0%
um there is a period of years where it
 
05:08:42.750 --> 05:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
seemed to be
 
05:08:45.310 --> 05:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
relatively uh some decent coverage of
 
05:08:47.788 --> 05:08:47.798 align:start position:0%
the Marine Patrol but as of late the
 
05:08:50.670 --> 05:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
past several years it seems that uh the
 
05:08:52.708 --> 05:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
presence of Marine Patrol um on our
 
05:08:54.470 --> 05:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
Lakes has decreased at least that's what
 
05:08:57.070 --> 05:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing and that's a current concern
 
05:08:59.390 --> 05:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
for us of course for safety reasons and
 
05:09:02.030 --> 05:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
also uh just law enforcement in general
 
05:09:04.590 --> 05:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
helping to enforce water quality laws
 
05:09:07.070 --> 05:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
out on the water as well so we urge you
 
05:09:09.510 --> 05:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
to support this and and if if we are
 
05:09:12.190 --> 05:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
organization were asked to come um talk
 
05:09:14.430 --> 05:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
to the task force we of course would be
 
05:09:17.150 --> 05:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
happy to do so so with that I'd be happy
 
05:09:18.948 --> 05:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
to answer any
 
05:09:20.750 --> 05:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
05:09:23.708 --> 05:09:23.718 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes repres I
 
05:09:26.310 --> 05:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
Muse I noticed that in the bill all of
 
05:09:28.548 --> 05:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
the folks on the task force are actually
 
05:09:31.270 --> 05:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement um would it be
 
05:09:33.670 --> 05:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
helpful to have your Association and
 
05:09:35.310 --> 05:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
some of the other folks who represent
 
05:09:38.270 --> 05:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
people who actually live along the Lakes
 
05:09:40.270 --> 05:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
uh being part of that task force or is
 
05:09:41.868 --> 05:09:41.878 align:start position:0%
it enough just to go to the public
 
05:09:44.510 --> 05:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
meetings that's a great question I I did
 
05:09:47.110 --> 05:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
see that groups like myself um our group
 
05:09:50.230 --> 05:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
would be invited and I think that alone
 
05:09:53.190 --> 05:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
would be helpful um if if we were asked
 
05:09:55.910 --> 05:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
to sit on the group U we asked to sit on
 
05:09:57.788 --> 05:09:57.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of groups and we do and of course
 
05:09:59.390 --> 05:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
we would make someone available but I
 
05:10:00.948 --> 05:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
think having a venue to at least come
 
05:10:03.070 --> 05:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
and visit and and answer questions and
 
05:10:05.990 --> 05:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
provide ideas would be
 
05:10:10.830 --> 05:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:13.590 --> 05:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else see no further
 
05:10:15.030 --> 05:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
05:10:15.040 --> 05:10:17.030 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
thank

05:10:17.030 --> 05:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:10:31.190 --> 05:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:33.430 --> 05:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
dunlevy good afternoon chairman Roy
 
05:10:35.190 --> 05:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee my
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
name is Tim Dunley and I'm here today
 
05:10:39.750 --> 05:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
representing the Department of Safety uh
 
05:10:41.670 --> 05:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
the Marine Patrol unit of the State
 
05:10:44.470 --> 05:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
Police I come today in support of this
 
05:10:47.350 --> 05:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
bill the department of safety recognizes
 
05:10:50.548 --> 05:10:50.558 align:start position:0%
the intent that um representative Darby
 
05:10:53.430 --> 05:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
brings uh uh to you folks in the form of
 
05:10:55.750 --> 05:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
the bill it recognizes its
 
05:10:58.310 --> 05:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to chair the task force
 
05:11:00.868 --> 05:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
and frankly um they thought that perhaps
 
05:11:03.430 --> 05:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
the task force where State Police is
 
05:11:06.750 --> 05:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
currently working to do what they can to
 
05:11:09.868 --> 05:11:09.878 align:start position:0%
uh increase the coverage um
 
05:11:12.390 --> 05:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
open to other ideas but but have ideas
 
05:11:13.788 --> 05:11:13.798 align:start position:0%
of their own and and they believe that
 
05:11:16.190 --> 05:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
this task force approach is likely the
 
05:11:18.830 --> 05:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
better route to take I'm happy to answer
 
05:11:21.910 --> 05:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
any questions you folks might have of us
 
05:11:23.628 --> 05:11:23.638 align:start position:0%

05:11:35.350 --> 05:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
probably know um and have heard the last
 
05:11:38.190 --> 05:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
Fistful of years uh the ability to
 
05:11:40.310 --> 05:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
recruit law enforcement officers in our
 
05:11:43.590 --> 05:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
country never mind our state never mind
 
05:11:45.548 --> 05:11:45.558 align:start position:0%
uh to a seasonal operation that Marine
 
05:11:47.350 --> 05:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
Patrol is has been a challenge for
 
05:11:49.990 --> 05:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
agencies and we are no exception yeah I
 
05:11:51.430 --> 05:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
actually put in a bill this year we're
 
05:11:53.350 --> 05:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
going to be hearing next week um to
 
05:11:55.470 --> 05:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
establish a commission to study the
 
05:11:57.548 --> 05:11:57.558 align:start position:0%
shortage in law enforcement and ways we
 
05:11:59.390 --> 05:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
might be able to recruit more people to
 
05:12:01.750 --> 05:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
the field so I do understand that and
 
05:12:02.948 --> 05:12:02.958 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding that there may
 
05:12:04.430 --> 05:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
be a couple of other bills like that
 
05:12:07.030 --> 05:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
floating around this session that that
 
05:12:10.310 --> 05:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh I think um is is really the Crux to
 
05:12:13.390 --> 05:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
the issue and and uh if this task force
 
05:12:15.390 --> 05:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
can look specifically at ways that
 
05:12:19.628 --> 05:12:19.638 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol can can recruit and and um
 
05:12:23.230 --> 05:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
get the coverage that that it's um
 
05:12:26.510 --> 05:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
trying now creatively to increase uh
 
05:12:29.030 --> 05:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
will help okay maybe we need to start
 
05:12:31.390 --> 05:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
rerunning reruns of northwards law or
 
05:12:34.230 --> 05:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
something people involv um any further
 
05:12:36.030 --> 05:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
05:12:39.628 --> 05:12:39.638 align:start position:0%
so thank you for taking my question um
 
05:12:42.390 --> 05:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the the program
 
05:12:42.400 --> 05:12:44.350 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the the program
Northwoods

05:12:44.350 --> 05:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
Northwoods
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
law thank you for the question
 
05:12:47.708 --> 05:12:47.718 align:start position:0%
representative yes
 
05:12:51.628 --> 05:12:51.638 align:start position:0%
sir in my mind Northwoods law is could
 
05:12:55.548 --> 05:12:55.558 align:start position:0%
be a chamber of commerce advertisement
 
05:12:58.830 --> 05:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire and I've
 
05:13:01.590 --> 05:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
made this suggestion to other agencies
 
05:13:08.350 --> 05:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
that are in in uh Manpower shortages to
 
05:13:11.350 --> 05:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
expand their their horizons with respect
 
05:13:14.948 --> 05:13:14.958 align:start position:0%
to their recruitment efforts and
 
05:13:18.150 --> 05:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
apply some effort to recruiting people
 
05:13:20.548 --> 05:13:20.558 align:start position:0%
that are getting out of the military
 
05:13:22.948 --> 05:13:22.958 align:start position:0%
service a lot of people who are getting
 
05:13:26.430 --> 05:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
out of the military service have
 
05:13:29.430 --> 05:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
wonderful experience but
 
05:13:33.110 --> 05:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
also uh maybe do not have Roots
 
05:13:38.030 --> 05:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
anywhere uh the New Hampshire uh uh
 
05:13:41.030 --> 05:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
lifestyle is very appealing for a lot of
 
05:13:44.350 --> 05:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
these young folks and I would encourage
 
05:13:48.070 --> 05:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
you to somehow find a way of tapping
 
05:13:50.548 --> 05:13:50.558 align:start position:0%
into that resource have you ever thought
 
05:13:53.070 --> 05:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
of that before that's the
 
05:13:55.628 --> 05:13:55.638 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative yes I
 
05:14:00.470 --> 05:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
can assure you that uh uh our our uh
 
05:14:02.310 --> 05:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
military folks that are that are coming
 
05:14:04.070 --> 05:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
out of service whether it's a retirement
 
05:14:06.788 --> 05:14:06.798 align:start position:0%
or have just Ser made their served their
 
05:14:09.470 --> 05:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
commitment uh are absolutely a Target of
 
05:14:11.670 --> 05:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
ours in fact we just hired two coming
 
05:14:13.350 --> 05:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
out of the Coast Guard for full-time
 
05:14:15.830 --> 05:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
positions that had been vacant for
 
05:14:18.430 --> 05:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
several years so we are we are tapping
 
05:14:20.990 --> 05:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
into that resource uh we are tapping
 
05:14:25.868 --> 05:14:25.878 align:start position:0%
into um uh when when the state police
 
05:14:29.030 --> 05:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
recruits for Trooper positions 90% of
 
05:14:31.270 --> 05:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
the time there's a Marine Patrol uniform
 
05:14:33.830 --> 05:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
at that table or that Booth um
 
05:14:33.840 --> 05:14:34.990 align:start position:0%
at that table or that Booth um
recruiting

05:14:34.990 --> 05:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
recruiting
 
05:14:36.868 --> 05:14:36.878 align:start position:0%
alongside one of the things we're
 
05:14:39.030 --> 05:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with is is sortly the SE
 
05:14:41.670 --> 05:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
seasonal nature of of our Patrol Force
 
05:14:43.948 --> 05:14:43.958 align:start position:0%
but that the state police is looking at
 
05:14:46.230 --> 05:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh recently the last couple of years
 
05:14:47.670 --> 05:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
have employed what they've referred to
 
05:14:49.990 --> 05:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
as the joint enforcement of the jet team
 
05:14:52.270 --> 05:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
where they're actually um taking
 
05:14:55.470 --> 05:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
advantage of of Road Troopers uh on
 
05:14:57.310 --> 05:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
their off time to come and and work
 
05:15:00.510 --> 05:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
Patrol shifts on the water so the the
 
05:15:03.190 --> 05:15:03.200 align:start position:0%
the creative thinking is there uh and
 
05:15:06.190 --> 05:15:06.200 align:start position:0%
certainly with time and and uh attention
 
05:15:08.628 --> 05:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
to this the state police is is anxious
 
05:15:14.670 --> 05:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:18.190 --> 05:15:18.200 align:start position:0%
can my son was actually a marine patrol
 
05:15:21.270 --> 05:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
officer for a while many people don't
 
05:15:24.830 --> 05:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
don't know this but Marine Patrol
 
05:15:26.708 --> 05:15:26.718 align:start position:0%
officers go through the police
 
05:15:29.830 --> 05:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
academy and uh so they are law
 
05:15:36.788 --> 05:15:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:39.190 --> 05:15:39.200 align:start position:0%
