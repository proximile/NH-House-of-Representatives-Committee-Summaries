fashionably late uh before we get
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
started on our business today if I can
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
have somebody lead us in the pledge how
 
00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:07.720 align:start position:0%

all

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh as a courtesy just to uh not
 
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
waste people's time uh it was my hope to
 
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0%
get everything done today but there's a
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
couple of bills that we still would like
 
00:25:50.669 --> 00:25:50.679 align:start position:0%
to look at a little bit further so if
 
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:53.320 align:start position:0%

right

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.750 align:start position:0%
right
1637

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
1637
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:33.190 align:start position:0%
 
1158

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll get right into it I'm
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
going to open up the executive session
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
1063 relative to motor vehicle speed
 
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:44.200 align:start position:0%
limit within 10 miles per hour of the
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
speed limit and the chair recognizes
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski for a motion thank
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I move to make a motion of
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
itl and HB
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
1063 uh motion is itl do I have a second
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
represent uh seconded by representative
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
Jones do you care to speak to your
 
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
motion I do thank you um 1063 I think uh
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
is kind of dangerous because when you
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
start talking about going within 10
 
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
miles an hour of the posted speed limit
 
00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
my concern is that if we do approve this
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
bill uh that's a slippery slope because
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
now uh drivers might start to push it
 
00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
even more and go 20 miles over over the
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
speed limit and I think that's a concern
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
so with that I cannot support that bill
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
so that's why I suggest I
 
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you sir anybody else from the
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
SES yeah I also would support an itl
 
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
motion um this is a bill that doesn't
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
make any practical sense from a
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement point of view it does not
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
make any sense from a public safety
 
00:27:48.509 --> 00:27:48.519 align:start position:0%
point of view um it just doesn't make
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
sense and so I would urge my colleagues
 
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
itl anybody else representative
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
Jones thank you Mr chair and I agree
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
with the itl and uh just reading briefly
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
from the uh Department of Transportation
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh saying how would arbitrarily 10 miles
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
per hour essentially making any previous
 
00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
engineering and traffic invest
 
00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:14.750 align:start position:0%
engineering and traffic invest
investigations

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
00:28:17.509 --> 00:28:17.519 align:start position:0%
Obsolete and they finish off saying uh
 
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
speed limits that thus introduced only
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
seres as a decreased respect for the
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
speed limits in
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
general thank you thank you anybody else

06128 I can pass it out to the folks
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
here and
 
00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
um I think that's not that way there you
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
go and my fault I should have had that
 
00:31:26.669 --> 00:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
done while while you pass it out it
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
makes one slight change and it's where
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
the actual Bill had 60 days I've raised
 
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
that to
 
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.830 align:start position:0%
that to
120

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
120
 
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
okay actually a little bit out of line
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
out of sequence there but but next time
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
we'll get the amendment handed out first
 
00:31:44.509 --> 00:31:44.519 align:start position:0%
so we'll let everybody have an
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
it I did mean to ask if I should do that
 
00:31:50.399 --> 00:31:56.149 align:start position:0%
it I did mean to ask if I should do that
my

00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.159 --> 00:33:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
apologies

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll back up a moment now that
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
amendment representative s's motion for
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
the amendment I still need a second for
 
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment before we can bring it up
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative
 
00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
Hill so did you get the second on the
 
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
amendment from representative Hill no
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
okay so now um representative sers you
 
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
care to speak to the amendment yes thank
 
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so the amend like I said it
 
00:33:30.909 --> 00:33:30.919 align:start position:0%
it's just changing the um where the we
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
had 60 days we changing and my offer is
 
00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:36.519 align:start position:0%
to change that to 120 and my reasoning
 
00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
for that is uh if you're if you're some
 
00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
people work on their vehicles themselves
 
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
all right and you know if they Cur if
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
the vehicle is being inspected uh let's
 
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
say it's December or something like that
 
00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
or even January and they go in for an
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
inspection towards the end of the month
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
and it fails they need time to work on
 
00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
it so and it's no fun working outside in
 
00:34:01.389 --> 00:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
January February March necessarily so I
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
thought one extra month would actually
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
be helpful and um the other thing is the
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
the the uh o
 
00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:13.720 align:start position:0%
OBD2 itself uh sometimes take several
 
00:34:16.589 --> 00:34:16.599 align:start position:0%
miles you have to after after it's fixed
 
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
and reset it needs to actually take
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
several miles to actually go back in
 
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
before you can get it reinspected again
 
00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
so that's my
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
reasoning anybody else any other
 
00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you I would take exception
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
of what you said because I think it
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
takes a lot more than several miles um
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's 50 60 70 miles depending
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
on the vehicle that's a lot and
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
um it it's it doesn't affect just
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles that you work on yourself many
 
00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
times the garages will tell you it's
 
00:34:58.829 --> 00:34:58.839 align:start position:0%
going to take time to get this part in
 
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
or etc etc down so I think it's a
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable Amendment thank
 
00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
you anybody else from the committee
 
00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.390 align:start position:0%
you anybody else from the committee
representative

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
SS yeah so um speaking just to the
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
amendment um it increases the time I
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
understand that my problem is that it's
 
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
yet a bigger change than the original
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
Bill itself and there are so many
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions that um I can't
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
support the amendment and would urge my
 
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:27.640 align:start position:0%
colleagues not to support the
 
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment anybody
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair so uh the
 
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
statute talks about emissions but that's
 
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
not really what we're talking about an
 
00:35:44.349 --> 00:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
example that I'm personally aware of is
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
somebody bought a Jeep Liberty they paid
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
like $2,500 for it and the check engine
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
light was not on because the person they
 
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:55.720 align:start position:0%
bought it from reset the light it was
 
00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
about all the money they had for a
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
vehicle they drove the thing home and
 
00:36:02.589 --> 00:36:02.599 align:start position:0%
about 50 Mi later the check engine light
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
comes on it was throwing a code for a
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
clutch which is really funny because it
 
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
was an
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
automatic I don't know what that has to
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
do with emissions but at any rate so
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
this person without a lot of money is
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
now potentially in a situation where the
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
transmission has to be removed to affect
 
00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:22.599 align:start position:0%
the repair to pass emissions and that
 
00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
repair is going to cost about what they
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
paid for the vehicle for somebody that's
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
low income and just getting by coming up
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
with another two grand I think 6 months
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
is optimistic but I'd like to at least
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
give them that long to be able to make
 
00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.710 align:start position:0%
give them that long to be able to make
the

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:41.069 --> 00:36:41.079 align:start position:0%
repair anybody else and I have to agree
 
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
for the years I've been involved in this
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
the one thing I do he is the emissions
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
and sometimes the difficulty it is for
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
them to even diagnose it once that's
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
done then you start looking at in a lot
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
of cases a lot of money uh again this is
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
not saying you don't have to fix it it
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
just gives you a little a bit more time
 
00:36:59.069 --> 00:36:59.079 align:start position:0%
to save up the money so I'll be
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
supporting the amendment uh anybody else
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none um I I did do a
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
Voice vote on our last Amendment but
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
then I get an email from our clerk
 
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
saying I'm not supposed to so we'll do a
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.550 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
0612 all those in favor raise your
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
hand we got one two three four five six
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
14 okay the amendment is adopted
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
14 what's up the nose I'll raise your
 
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
hand for the nose please I was going to
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.630 align:start position:0%
 
official

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
two5 so the motion on the floor now is
 
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended any further
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
discussion on the
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
bill seeing
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
none representative Sykes
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
so on the motion of ought to pass as
 
00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.150 align:start position:0%
so on the motion of ought to pass as
amended

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
um I would urge my colleagues to vote
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
against that aut to pass motion because
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
there are what I believe to be
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
significant um concerns and unanswered
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
questions relative to how uh any changes
 
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
in the OBD program which will have
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
eventually have to get before the feds
 
00:38:54.079 --> 00:38:55.309 align:start position:0%
eventually have to get before the feds
for

00:38:55.309 --> 00:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
approval um
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
and how that will all play out the big
 
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
the scariest part for me on this is that
 
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh air quality people in the feds do
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
agree to the
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
change typically in order to meet the
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions standard that
 
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:19.640 align:start position:0%
they set for New Hampshire will have to
 
00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:21.319 align:start position:0%
be met by some
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
other segment of the of the motoring
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
public I know this is a small
 
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
a very small change but um I just worry
 
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
about uh we are
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
already out of compliance with their
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
normal way of doing things and they've
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
given us uh a grace period by allowing
 
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:45.640 align:start position:0%
uh different slightly different
 
00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
standards and I just I worry about
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
opening up that can of
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
worms anybody
 
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
Jones thank you uh um yes I did vote for
 
00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment in uh because I thought it
 
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
was good in case this does pass but I am
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill itself uh what
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
stands out for me is when Dees told us
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
that we could risk funding from the EPA
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
so I'll be voting against it YP fair
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
enough anybody else I'll just say this
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
um I will be supporting the bill as
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
amended uh I just don't think it's right
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not saying that these
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles are not going to be fixed it
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
just give
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
people some extra time uh I don't think
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's fair nor is it right for us to let
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
the Federal Environmental Protection
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
Agency Hold Us hostage from passing
 
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
policy in this state that actually can
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
help our citizens so I would encourage
 
00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
anybody or everybody to vote for the
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%

motion sir uh thank you Mr chair just
 
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
that some of the testimony we heard
 
00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
especially from the major general and
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
the uh I think it was Lieutenant Colonel
 
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
that was here um they mentioned this was
 
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
kind of more one-sided and and U there
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
really wasn't a fair
 
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%

1244 motion is in expedient to legislate
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%

second by representative de do you care
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion sir I do thank
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um when I read the bill
 
00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
1244 and prohibiting smoking any
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
cigarettes in a vehicle one of the
 
00:47:09.069 --> 00:47:09.079 align:start position:0%
things that really strikes me with this
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
this is a huge civil liberties issue for
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
me for us as a state to tell somebody to
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
say what you can and cannot do in your
 
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle I think really really crosses
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
the line and to me this is a slippery
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
slope what's next after three cigarettes
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
or cigarettes is it coffee is it
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
drinking soda so I think this is a
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
slippery slope I cannot support this
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
bill I encourage my co colleagues to itl
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
it as well thank you anybody else from
 
00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.190 align:start position:0%
it as well thank you anybody else from
the

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
a thank you Mr chairman um I just think
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
it's important for us to protect the
 
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:49.640 align:start position:0%
kids that can't speak up and against
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
their parents when they're smoking in
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
the car I grew up with a father who
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
smoked in the car against my protests he
 
00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
trigger migraines for me and made my
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
life absolutely miserable and it didn't
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
matter if he cracked the window or or
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
what and we all know that secondhand
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
smoke is as dangerous
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
as this to the people around you as it
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
is to the smoker himself themselves um
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
so I can't support this build fair
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
enough anybody else from the committee
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative sers thank you Mr chair
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
so I go back I think it's on
 
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
representative gski was saying it's this
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
is private property this is like having
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
someone come into my house and saying
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
you can't smoke in your house someone
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
saying come into you this is my vehicle
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
and saying you can't smoke in my vehicle
 
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
or telling me I can't smoke I this do
 
00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:39.559 align:start position:0%
it's it's just not right I
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
get adults should be smart enough and
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
want to be safe enough to protect their
 
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
children or anybody else that's riding
 
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
in with them to say okay I'm going to
 
00:48:50.589 --> 00:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
hold off right but in some cases they
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
just can't and and they don't so but it
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
is private property and we should be
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
able to do it with what we want in our
 
00:48:58.349 --> 00:48:58.359 align:start position:0%
own private
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
property representative
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
SES so
 
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm opposed to the motion and I would
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
like to point out several F SE SE
 
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
several Salient points um one as we've
 
00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
heard and I would remind everybody that
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
in fact secondhand smoke is a proven and
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
provable Hazard to not only the people
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
who smoke but also to the children who
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
are riding in the car it is a confined
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
space where they often Studies have
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
shown that even if the windows are open
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
the smoke still migrates to the back
 
00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
where children most likely are riding um
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
they're not always riding back there
 
00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
admittedly um we have a history of
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
thinking in this committee
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
about points of view that
 
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
represent safety and the protection of
 
00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.390 align:start position:0%
represent safety and the protection of
children

00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:49:58.349 --> 00:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
and that's really what this bill is
 
00:49:59.950 --> 00:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
about it's not
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
about personal point of privilege to be
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
able to smoke in your car because you
 
00:50:07.789 --> 00:50:07.799 align:start position:0%
want to it's about the protection of
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
children from a known Hazard it um it is
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
a secondary offense so that means that
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
the police officer uh certainly will not
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
stop you and and and get into your
 
00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
personal private space as you will just
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
on that basis alone but would have
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
stopped you for some other offense that
 
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
you were
 
00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
creating so if you're creating other
 
00:50:37.549 --> 00:50:37.559 align:start position:0%
offenses that have brought to the
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
attention of the police officer it is to
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
my mind not a far leap for us to
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
continue that record of protection for
 
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
children for which this bill is
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
eminently uh suitable and
 
00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.390 align:start position:0%
eminently uh suitable and
appropriate

00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
representative St Clair thank you Mr
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
chair sorry there we go at first I
 
00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
uh sitting here was not going to support
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
this bill um I talked to a lot of people
 
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
my constituents listen to the students
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
that were here and also asked some
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
members of this group and other members
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
in the house uh what they would do if if
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
they had kids in the car would you allow
 
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
smoking if your children were in the
 
00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:29.720 align:start position:0%
back seat or in the front seat would you
 
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
allow it and every person said no I
 
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
would not and I think that speaks to
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here we know
 
00:51:39.549 --> 00:51:39.559 align:start position:0%
that we know a lot more now about
 
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
smoking than we did when we were all
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
kids it's not a it's not a maybe it's a
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
fact and I think as representative Sy
 
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
said being a secondary Bill we don't
 
00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:51.799 align:start position:0%
have to worry about people out there
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
binoculars watching to see if you're
 
00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
smoking in your vehicle when it goes by
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh I think this is a reasonable Bill and
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
even if it just encourages people to to
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
not do this in their car where it's an
 
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
enclosed Thing versus a house um it it
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
can't hurt it's a good bill I
 
00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
don't personally I don't think it'll get
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
through the house but I think this is a
 
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
good a
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
good example that we can set in this
 
00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
committee by uh supporting us thank you
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski thank you Mr
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
chairman so let me try to understand
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
this the logic of the bill is to protect
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
the children from secondary smoke but
 
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
it's a secondary offense so if I stay
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
under the speed limit don't cause any
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
offense and smoke in the car because I
 
00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
can now because it's only a secondary
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
offense I can still smoke so the purpose
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
of the bill is to protect the
 
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
children as a secondary offense but as
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
long as I follow the rules of the road I
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
can smoke to my heart content so so I'm
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
really supporting the children because
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
if I stay within the speed limit or I so
 
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
the rules of the road I'm still can
 
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
smoke to me it doesn't make any logic
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
sense of this bill that's why I cannot
 
00:53:07.079 --> 00:53:10.630 align:start position:0%
sense of this bill that's why I cannot
support

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
sakes so I just want to be clear about
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
this issue of secondary offense a
 
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
secondary offense is just that it
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it legal for you to drive
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
in your car smoke
 
00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
and it's okay for you to do that in
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
spite of the bill that's not what the
 
00:53:34.589 --> 00:53:34.599 align:start position:0%
bill says the bill says exactly what it
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
says and to to think that you can
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
continue to drive in your car as long as
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
you behave yourself it's okay and it's
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
not against the law is is
 
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
logic I'm going to go to S somebody who
 
00:53:56.349 --> 00:53:56.359 align:start position:0%
hasn't been heard from yet
 
00:53:56.359 --> 00:53:57.789 align:start position:0%
hasn't been heard from yet
representative

00:53:57.789 --> 00:53:57.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
pondon thank you Mr chair I too have
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
wrestled with this I understand that it
 
00:54:06.789 --> 00:54:06.799 align:start position:0%
is currently illegal in eight states and
 
00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
it's a secondary
 
00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:10.839 align:start position:0%
action where I'm wrestling the most with
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
is the unclear Parts uh of this
 
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
legislation there's a difference in
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle sizes between a two-seater and a
 
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
motor home at what size do we look at in
 
00:54:26.589 --> 00:54:26.599 align:start position:0%
for cubic space that is detrimental to
 
00:54:26.599 --> 00:54:27.309 align:start position:0%
for cubic space that is detrimental to
the

00:54:27.309 --> 00:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
children um right now we're looking at
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
it as a moving violation but nothing in
 
00:54:34.109 --> 00:54:34.119 align:start position:0%
the legislation states that the
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle's moving I mean if it's the
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle's parked in a parking lot and
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
adults are smoking there's nothing in
 
00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
here I mean from what I read on it an
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
officer going by could issue a $100
 
00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:50.680 align:start position:0%
citation I just think this the
 
00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
legislation is porous I would like to
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
see something cleaner I I understand the
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
health of the children but really it
 
00:54:59.789 --> 00:54:59.799 align:start position:0%
comes down to common sense parenting I
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
think uh adults need to be adults on
 
00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
issues and be responsible um so that's
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
where I sit on this uh and I thank you
 
00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you I'm G to throw one
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
out there um that hasn't been brought up
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
yet surprisingly uh
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
enforceability uh not too many and it's
 
00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
a legitimate concern most miners don't
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
carry IDs with them so at what point of
 
00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:26.559 align:start position:0%
delaying a traffic stop um is is needs
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
to be there to prove how old some of
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
these children in question might be I
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
find it as a as a problem did you still
 
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:36.200 align:start position:0%
have your hand up representative sellers
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair the the other two
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
points I want to bring up is
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
that in my case my wife and I bore these
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
children we rais these children they're
 
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:48.039 align:start position:0%
our children they're not the state's
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
children so they're ours to take care of
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we will do the best we can
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
but that's that's one point and and I
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
don't want the state infringing on my
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
rights on my kids for sure or my
 
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
property for that matter if I don't have
 
00:56:05.309 --> 00:56:05.319 align:start position:0%
to the second thing is it it talks about
 
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes now I haven't seen any study
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
and I don't know but that's vaping and
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
vaping is I thought it's just vapor and
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if that's cancerous or not
 
00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
or whatnot so because we did talk about
 
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
cancer here I think so I you're
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
inclusing of everything and I'm just
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.510 align:start position:0%
concerned about
that

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
okay anything new on this
 
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
debate so I I'll give you I'll give you
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
Clair representative stclair thank you
 
00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I just wanted to respond and
 
00:56:53.789 --> 00:56:53.799 align:start position:0%
and if only we knew that all parents are
 
00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay anything to do representative
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chair and I will be
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
different um there's there's a big
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
difference between uh rights and
 
00:57:10.349 --> 00:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
Privileges and operating a vehicle in
 
00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a privilege it's not a
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
right and it's our it's basically our
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
duty to make that privilege as safe as
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
it is for the same reason uh you can't
 
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
have open containers for the same reason
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
you can't um
 
00:57:29.069 --> 00:57:29.079 align:start position:0%
use a cell phone and and so on uh I
 
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
think anything we can safely control
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
within the bounds of operating a vehicle
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
is our duty to do it thank
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
you okay was seeing nobody else on U
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
that wishes to
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
speak I
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
will as I'm losing my train of thought
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
here um the motion on the floor is
 
00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:56.440 align:start position:0%

know I I think that the Bill's got good
 
01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
intentions but it's just too broad um
 
01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
I've got a family friend who's got a
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
12-year-old who sits in the front seat

thank you Mr chair I move to ought to

by representative London do you care to
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes thank you Mr
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
chair so this bill um quite honestly
 
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
it's a simple um simple legislation that
 
01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense um basically it's a
 
01:03:22.349 --> 01:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
it's a preventative deterrent to um
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
maintain the Integrity of these wooden
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
bridges that
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
in most cases are historical in nature
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and repeated damaging to these
 
01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
Bridges can become um a safety issue uh
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony that there was school
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
buses driving over it you know um you
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
know God forbid that would have happened
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
and and something tragic happened with
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
with a bus load of children or a bus
 
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
load of just people in general um so
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
essentially this bill would raise the
 
01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:55.240 align:start position:0%
fine from $62 to $11,000 and up to um
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
$2,000 as needed and basically it's a
 
01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.870 align:start position:0%
$2,000 as needed and basically it's a
deterrent

01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
deterrent
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
to um minimize oversized Vehicles
 
01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.589 align:start position:0%
to um minimize oversized Vehicles
driving

01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
driving
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
around uh driving through the bridge and
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
actually take a separate route so I I
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
think it's uh it's Common Sense
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
legislation I think we should pass
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
it thank you sir anybody else from the
 
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
committee representative syes yeah I
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
also would support the OTP um there are
 
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
lots of communities that have uh
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
historical wooden bridges this is not a
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
is ol ated incident in any particular
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
area of the state um PE they they help
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
with tourism uh they help with I mean
 
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
there's literally something called The
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
Covered Bridge uh Road Rally where you
 
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
know Road rers go through covered
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
bridges that's great but if you damage
 
01:04:45.269 --> 01:04:45.279 align:start position:0%
the bridge and it has to be closed it's
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
really it that's a really unfortunate
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
thing and plus people may be injured and
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
so for the that all the reasons
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
elucidated by representative foot I
 
01:04:57.269 --> 01:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
think we should vote uh on to
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
pass thank you anybody else
 
01:04:59.599 --> 01:05:00.789 align:start position:0%
pass thank you anybody else
representative

01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chair um yeah covered
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
bridges are part of the culture of New
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think we deserve to
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
protect them and uh I I don't think $62
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
is a deterrent I think we do need to uh
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
increase that and there's also a
 
01:05:18.269 --> 01:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
companion bill I I believe it's in
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
criminal justice allowing uh cameras on
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
these Bridges so we can uh catch those
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
who were uh violating so I think this is
 
01:05:28.589 --> 01:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
a good bill to pass and I would like to
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
see it
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
happen representative plon yeah just to
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
add to uh comments of my constitues here
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
the bill besides adding a fine up
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
thousand or up to 200000 it also uh
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
specifies that any
 
01:05:48.109 --> 01:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
damage uh would be uh responsible for
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
replacement repair of the bridge uh if
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
any vehicle in violation so it's beyond
 
01:05:58.029 --> 01:05:58.039 align:start position:0%
f L it's also they're going to pay the
 
01:06:02.349 --> 01:06:02.359 align:start position:0%
damage fair enough anybody else from the
 
01:06:05.269 --> 01:06:05.279 align:start position:0%

01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
a 23439 does not have a subsection I
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
think this might be a typo and perhaps
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
23441 which is under the transportation
 
01:06:42.029 --> 01:06:42.039 align:start position:0%

234 any person who operates or attempts
 
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
to operate any vehicle on such bridge
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
when the weight of the load inclusive of
 
01:06:56.589 --> 01:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
the vehicle exceeds such posted load
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%

vehicle on such bridge in violation of
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
such conditions what a word salad but
 
01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
anyway um shall not be found more than
 
01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
$100 the bill I don't think works unless
 
01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:21.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
throughout I'll hold that time for a
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
second anything else from anybody else
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:52.920 --> 01:08:01.870 align:start position:0%
 
committee

01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
just to keep it the discussion open um I
 
01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
can't recess it with a Time specific uh
 
01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
and if we were going to try to fix it
 
01:08:11.069 --> 01:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
recess it okay recess it I'm good with
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
that um with a Time specific um I could
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
do that I don't know if I need to do
 
01:08:19.349 --> 01:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
that if I'm going to push it up till
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
next week we will reschedule it for sure
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
but just to keep it on the up and up I'm
 
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
going to recess it um next week is that
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
the vacation
 
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:33.560 align:start position:0%

20th that's okay we'll take care of it
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
next week so I'll cover all my bases
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
here due to the technical change that we
 
01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:48.759 align:start position:0%
just discovered I will recess the
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%

to prohibiting parking of non-electric
 
01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles in spaces designated for
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
charging electric
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:05.709 --> 01:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chairman I would move
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
to aop pass the motion is ought to pass
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
second St Clair second seconded by
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative St Clair car to speak to
 
01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
your motion sir thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:11:23.229 --> 01:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
this is just a common sense Bill we we
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
put that thousand of dollars or private
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
companies put thousands of dollars into
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
creating these spaces and for soone it
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
just inconsiderate for someone to be
 
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
taking these spaces but I guess it's
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
bill anybody else from the
 
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
committee representa CER thank you Mr
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
chairman so I don't think we should be
 
01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
legislating common courtesy um as
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
there's more electric spaces that come
 
01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
available I think they're going to be
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
more and more of a higher percentage of
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
the parking lot totals so uh this might
 
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
be a temporary issue that's going to
 
01:11:59.709 --> 01:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
solve itself as the electric vehicle
 
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
technology kind of U becomes more common
 
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
in our uh in our
 
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
state anybody else
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman I
 
01:12:11.070 --> 01:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
see this more as
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh kind of a you're preventing somebody
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
from earning their income by blocking
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
these spaces it's the equivalent of
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
putting a car in a in place of a gas
 
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
pump and then going in the store
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
shopping you you're preventing anybody
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
from using the gas pump and you're
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
preventing the the business from earning
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue so to me this is kind of
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
equivalent to theft by blocking these
 
01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
spaces you're block you're preventing
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
somebody from earning their income um it
 
01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
maybe just a piece of their income and
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
maybe their entire income uh somebody
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
has a bank of of uh charging stations
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
and that's where they earn their money
 
01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
so just like somebody can have a gas
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
station that doesn't have any other
 
01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
business involved you're you're stealing
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
from them and you preventing them from
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
from earning their income and this is
 
01:12:59.470 --> 01:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
you know this is just a business bill as
 
01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
far as I'm
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
concerned anybody else from the
 
01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
committee representative Gorski thank
 
01:13:06.910 --> 01:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um when I heard the
 
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
testimony of this bill and read it in my
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
experience driving around outside of
 
01:13:13.709 --> 01:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
being a state rep in my business I drive
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
around see my clients and pretty much
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
most of the New England states at some
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
point in time I've never ever ever seen
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
this kind of situation happened now it
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
may be just luck in those times when I
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
was driving around and kind of looking
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
but I've never seen it happen and
 
01:13:33.629 --> 01:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
according to testimony it seems to be
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
happening a lot kind of in the Keen area
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
but I've personally not seen it so with
 
01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:42.280 align:start position:0%
that I I just as uh representative Coker
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
says it's legislating common sense I
 
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
just can't support
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
it anybody
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%

01:15:45.390 --> 01:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
is uh again in this bill I think I I
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
could take a picture of a vehicle
 
01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
sitting in uh in a space there that's
 
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
occupied an electric space it could even
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
be an electric vehicle that's not
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
plugged in I could take that picture
 
01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
bring down the police and they could
 
01:15:58.510 --> 01:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
ticket representative
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
SES yeah so um I I would be voting
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
against the OTP and um I excuse me itl
 
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
get get show my age here sorry folks um
 
01:16:17.629 --> 01:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
I vote against the itl
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
because we often talk about
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
how we shouldn't it shouldn't be
 
01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
necessary to vote to legislate for
 
01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
common sense and yet we do it every day
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
we every day we have bills that come
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
before us that that the argument is made
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
well it's just a simple Bill and it
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
makes Common Sense well what changed why
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
would we then not is that the only
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
argument against this bill secondarily
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh beside the argument of which was I
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
think incredibly important about uh it's
 
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
an income issue for folks it's it's also
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
a safety issue from the point of view
 
01:16:59.790 --> 01:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
that if you have a electric vehicle and
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
you are Char you are driving down the
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
road on vacation visiting our wonderful
 
01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
State and you know that you have the
 
01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
range to get to a certain place and then
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
you get there and it's late at night and
 
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
somebody is parked in your space and you
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
are stuck there with your children
 
01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
because you can't get into that space I
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
think that's really something that we
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
should take
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
be mindful of I also think that
 
01:17:31.629 --> 01:17:31.639 align:start position:0%
um not withstanding the fact that maybe
 
01:17:34.629 --> 01:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
I you you or I or somebody else hasn't
 
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
seen this happen that does not mean that
 
01:17:39.870 --> 01:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
it is not happening and in fact we had
 
01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
testimony that indicates that it is
 
01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
happening and I just I just think that
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh a way to uh discourage the use of
 
01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles which I I think is
 
01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
unfortunate I think we should be
 
01:17:59.629 --> 01:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
encouraging the use of electric vehicles
 
01:18:01.229 --> 01:18:01.239 align:start position:0%
for a lot of different reasons I know
 
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
that's a uh a loaded topic but this is a
 
01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
a change that affects businesses it is a
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
change that will help businesses this is
 
01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
a change that will help people in their
 
01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
Public Safety when they're traveling so
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
that they can prepare and be and feel
 
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable that when they get to the
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
spot where that might be only one single
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
charging station that that it will be
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
available for them we want to encourage
 
01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
people to feel comfortable about
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
charging as more and more electric
 
01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
vehicles come on the road we need to
 
01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that they people feel that
 
01:18:42.189 --> 01:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
they can come to New Hampshire which is
 
01:18:42.199 --> 01:18:45.270 align:start position:0%
they can come to New Hampshire which is
already

01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
a I might even call it a black hole of
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle charging stations
 
01:18:53.550 --> 01:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
relative to per capita vers versus other
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
New England states when are we going to
 
01:18:58.629 --> 01:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
wake up and say wow we don't want to do
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
that we're throwing away what is now I
 
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
think I don't want to quote percentages
 
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
but a more a significant proportion of
 
01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
the traveling public and is only going
 
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
greater representative Hill thank you Mr
 
01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
chairman um I was hesitating to actually
 
01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
speak on this
 
01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
but um the representatives comments
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
about uh the a scenario with the family
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh running down the street and not
 
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
having a place to uh to pull their car
 
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
in to plug in um I've been in that
 
01:19:37.149 --> 01:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
situation in in a car um late at night
 
01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
and found no gas stations open um by
 
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
your logic it would mean that every gas
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
station should should be open and
 
01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
available to me when I need it um and it
 
01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen that way at least here um
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
I guess my assumption would be that the
 
01:19:59.390 --> 01:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
person has parked in that spot for less
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
time than what a gas station is closed
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
um so at least there would be some way
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
of at some point getting there I've not
 
01:20:11.229 --> 01:20:11.239 align:start position:0%
found any place that only has one
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
electric charging station at a location
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
I the ones that I see usually well the
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
one that's nearby me has six I don't
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
know if there's there are places that
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
only have one but the real problem I
 
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
have with this is what representative
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
sellers Mo um mentioned earlier um to my
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge the
 
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
only opportunity that we
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
have um for an ordinary citizen to take
 
01:20:43.709 --> 01:20:43.719 align:start position:0%
a photo of a of a car and have an actual
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
ticket issued is with handicap plates um
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that's true but I think
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
that's true um I think this
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
is I don't think this Rises to the level
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
of the handicap plate um and for that
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:06.430 --> 01:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
I representative
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
London thank you uh Mr
 
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
chair I can't support the U the current
 
01:21:15.149 --> 01:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
motion to itl um I being a
 
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
representative from Nashville um I can
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
say I've seen at least twice uh gasoline
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles parked
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
typically at stores or restaurants in uh
 
01:21:30.669 --> 01:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
where electric electric vehicle spots um
 
01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
it's usually uh that these these
 
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
particular parking spots are close to
 
01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
the building thus running electric lines
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
and because it's close to the building
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
close to the door people tend to take
 
01:21:45.629 --> 01:21:45.639 align:start position:0%
these SPS uh instead of an electric
 
01:21:47.709 --> 01:21:47.719 align:start position:0%
vehicle thereby hampering those with
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles for a parking spot uh
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's beyond courtesy
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's just uh I think
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a need to legislate this
 
01:22:03.790 --> 01:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
regarding taking a picture uh larger
 
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities the police department
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
don't even do the parking tickets it
 
01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
goes to parking enforcement so typically
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
an individual would call the police
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
department they in turn would radio
 
01:22:17.709 --> 01:22:17.719 align:start position:0%
someone and parking enforcement it could
 
01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
be 45 minutes to an hour or more for a
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
parking enforcement Personnel to get to
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
that spot to witness uh a violation and
 
01:22:30.910 --> 01:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
ticket um so I just don't see that
 
01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:32.430 align:start position:0%
ticket um so I just don't see that
happening

01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
um and I question whether or not it is
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
illegal where they could even issue a
 
01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
ticket uh because it's a registered
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle I think the only caveat to
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
parking in these spots would be a
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
handicap plate where they can they can
 
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
park in any legal parking spot and for
 
01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
that I I have no issue with someone
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
handicapped parking as close to the door
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh because of their conditions but I
 
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
just can't support itl on this I I don't
 
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
think it's bad legislation thank you Mr
 
01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
chair okay represent rumo thank you Mr
 
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
chair I I have to say I'm really
 
01:23:12.189 --> 01:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
surprised by the tenor of some these
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
comments given how often we talk about
 
01:23:17.229 --> 01:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
the importance of private property
 
01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
rights and and people being able to
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
carry out their businesses um we heard
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
bipartisan testimony that this is huge
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
investment putting in these spaces and
 
01:23:29.790 --> 01:23:29.800 align:start position:0%
charging stations uh that it is
 
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
preventing business owners from
 
01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
recouping their Investments their
 
01:23:38.669 --> 01:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
expenses um impacting their incomes um
 
01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
and I agree it' be nice if people were
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
courteous and didn't take the spot but
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
essentially we're saying it's oh if
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
we are agreeing with the itl that it's
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
okay for someone to consciously block a
 
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
spot for whatever their reason may be
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's preventing someone from earning
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
their income on that spot and I just I
 
01:23:57.149 --> 01:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
I'm really surprised to hear that
 
01:23:59.629 --> 01:23:59.639 align:start position:0%
commentary from our committee
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
today anybody else representative Hill
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure whether this was covered
 
01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.550 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure whether this was covered
in

01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
um at any time um there was also
 
01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
language in the Bill about the
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
requirement to have signage uh put up it
 
01:24:19.950 --> 01:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear to me who would be
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for that signage and whether
 
01:24:25.709 --> 01:24:25.719 align:start position:0%
that was something that would be um
 
01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
required before the ticket would be
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
issued Andor whether that is uh the the
 
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the state or the
 
01:24:39.629 --> 01:24:39.639 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the of um the property
 
01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
owner I I don't know so that was another
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
question I had in my
 
01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
mind represent r i i respond my
 
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
understanding would be the the uh
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the business owner the
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
property owner I would encourage anyone
 
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
can correct me if I'm wrong about that
 
01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
but I think that that was the what I
 
01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
else I was going to add a few words but
 
01:25:13.390 --> 01:25:13.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's
 
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
necessary so the motion on the floor is
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on House Bill
 
01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:23.070 align:start position:0%

legislated is adopted 10 to9 obviously
 
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
it's going on the regular calendar we'll
 
01:26:43.149 --> 01:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
talk we'll talk about the majority
 
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
report is there going to be a Minority
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%

01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
I'll close the executive session on
 
01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:52.709 align:start position:0%
I'll close the executive session on
1416

01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
1416
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to back up in a moment we'll
 
01:26:57.070 --> 01:26:57.080 align:start position:0%

01:26:58.830 --> 01:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
1550 so we'll take that up in a few
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
minutes I'll hand these out now and I
 
01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:05.719 align:start position:0%
hope even though we're doing a great job
 
01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:08.199 align:start position:0%
steamrolling through this that we take a
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:56.350 align:start position:0%

01:28:08.189 --> 01:28:08.199 align:start position:0%
amendment I guess we got an extra
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%

amendment
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
20246 51h to
 
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
hp550 can I get a second on the offering
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:33:06.109 --> 01:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
amendment seconded by representative
 
01:33:08.189 --> 01:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
Jones care to speak to the
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
motion or no yes I get my question to
 
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
you is May May the prime sponsor speak
 
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
to the amendment is that proper procedur
 
01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
or do I need to address it you should
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay my understanding is that this
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
inserts sub D um under the new paragraph
 
01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
where it adds the language of
 
01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
municipality May specify the time of day
 
01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:30.280 align:start position:0%
when the reduced seasonal speed limit
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
effect and I believe your reading is
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
correct as I hold them side by side uh D
 
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
was added and it just created an e
 
01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
because the current D moves down to the
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
next section correct any anything else
 
01:33:49.149 --> 01:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
specifically on the amendment
 
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
representative SES yeah I would uh urged
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
the committee to support the amendment
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
it was one of the concerns that was
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
raised during the public testimony that
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh in the middle of the night
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
there would be not the same kind of
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
congestion um that was the bill was
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
trying to answer to and so this
 
01:34:12.990 --> 01:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
Sense anybody else from the committee is
 
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
that a is that a hand up yep
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative Hill uh thank you Mr
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm trying to reconcile and it
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
and it may be a completely different
 
01:34:29.310 --> 01:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
section but line 14 talks about the
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
municipality May recommend a seasonal
 
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
decrease and then how does that um
 
01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
resolve itself with line 20 May specify
 
01:34:42.189 --> 01:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
a time of day is that the same or is
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:50.189 --> 01:34:50.199 align:start position:0%
that I don't think so and again we can
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
talk about it when we get to the bill
 
01:34:54.030 --> 01:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
that the the the amendment is just
 
01:34:56.350 --> 01:34:56.360 align:start position:0%
saying that they can the municipality
 
01:34:58.109 --> 01:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
May specify the time of day of which
 
01:34:59.709 --> 01:34:59.719 align:start position:0%
that reduced seasonal speed limit would
 
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
be in
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
effect um because if pedestrians aren't
 
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
present all day why should the um
 
01:35:09.629 --> 01:35:09.639 align:start position:0%
reduction be there all day I I see it as
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
separate unless somebody else has got a
 
01:35:12.159 --> 01:35:13.950 align:start position:0%
separate unless somebody else has got a
question

01:35:13.950 --> 01:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:35:16.590 --> 01:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else on the amendment
 
01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:18.430 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else on the amendment
representative

pandon thank you just a probably a point
 
01:35:22.109 --> 01:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
of clarification
 
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
this would affect uh or give uh
 
01:35:27.390 --> 01:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities um the authority to
 
01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
reduce speed limits on Class 5 highways
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
um the definition of a class five
 
01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
Highway and I could be wrong is 30 to 35
 
01:35:36.990 --> 01:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
miles an hour if I can stop you this is
 
01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
to the amendment oh to the amendment we
 
01:35:40.109 --> 01:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
we'll have an opportunity to speak to
 
01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
the bill once once we figure out what to
 
01:35:44.669 --> 01:35:44.679 align:start position:0%
do with this yeah so anything else on
 
01:35:44.679 --> 01:35:45.470 align:start position:0%

the
 
01:35:48.270 --> 01:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
amendment seeing
 
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
none why don't we just do a roll call on
 
01:35:52.109 --> 01:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment or
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
instead of the hand raising that I
 
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
attempted last time heaven forbid we do
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
something easy like a voice
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
vat so the this the motion is on the
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
adoption of amendment
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
06518 and I'll ask the clerk to call the

the floor is ought to pass as amended uh
 
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
anybody wish to speak to the bill as
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
amended did you still want to go thank
 
01:37:19.229 --> 01:37:19.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I apologize for jumping the
 
01:37:22.030 --> 01:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
gun there um I just want to point a
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
clarification this would uh regarding
 
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
class five highways and being able to
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
alter them I just want to be sure to my
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
understanding typically they're 30 to 35
 
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
M over speed limits set by the mcds that
 
01:37:39.149 --> 01:37:39.159 align:start position:0%
this state does anybody know I mean
 
01:37:41.709 --> 01:37:41.719 align:start position:0%
we're not talking classifi at you know
 
01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
55 M hour going down to whatever the
 
01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:46.149 align:start position:0%
55 M hour going down to whatever the
town

01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
wants do we have anybody from the
 
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation here that
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
may want to confirm that oh is that Mr
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
Lambert hiding in the back
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
see good afternoon I think now close to
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
it right so for the record Bill Lambert
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire dot currently the highway
 
01:38:16.589 --> 01:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
safety act of Transportation
 
01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
administrator but 23 years a state
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
traffic engineer so the answer to your
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
question um statutory speed limits on
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
All State highways it's not mutcd that's
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire statute so RSA
 
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
26560 defined speed limits for urban
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
residents is 30 um and then rural
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
residential in class five is is
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
35 um so class fives outside of the
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
compact part of any city of town and
 
01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:45.320 align:start position:0%
that's a Density definition would be
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
35 within the compact part of the of a
 
01:38:50.589 --> 01:38:50.599 align:start position:0%
city of town would be 30 uh and this
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
bill address is the class five roads um
 
01:38:55.629 --> 01:38:55.639 align:start position:0%
that are 35 or typically no more than
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
that towns can make them higher but I
 
01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
don't know of any Town that's ever done
 
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
that does that get the answer you were
 
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
looking for uh thank you Mr chair just
 
01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
again on the clarification is I think
 
01:39:09.870 --> 01:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
the way the legislation is written is
 
01:39:12.270 --> 01:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
mainly going to be those areas that are
 
01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
more of an urban density which are 30 uh
 
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
the classifi as 35 I kind of don't see
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
that happening but we're in that realm
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
30 to 35 so thank you Mr chair for and
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:33.679 align:start position:0%
D yeah and it if you if I'm reading this
 
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
correctly it doesn't have to be 20 miles
 
01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
an hour it could be increments down to
 
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
depending on the current speed limit of
 
01:39:43.229 --> 01:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
the road that's that that's there so
 
01:39:45.550 --> 01:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
anything else or anybody else from the
 
01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
committee on
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
this I'll I'll go ahead representative
 
01:39:50.159 --> 01:39:53.030 align:start position:0%
this I'll I'll go ahead representative
Smith

01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
I just have a question uh I don't know
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
who can answer it so at the beginning
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment replaces the entire bill
 
01:40:03.589 --> 01:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
right the amendment's the bill and it
 
01:40:05.470 --> 01:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
begins with notwithstanding the
 
01:40:09.109 --> 01:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
provisions of paragraph one RSA blah
 
01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
blah or any other law to the contrary
 
01:40:15.229 --> 01:40:15.239 align:start position:0%
okay then it gives the municipalities
 
01:40:18.669 --> 01:40:18.679 align:start position:0%
the power to alter the speed limits and
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
this goes into
 
01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:21.830 align:start position:0%
this goes into
26563

01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
26563
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
01:40:27.149 --> 01:40:27.159 align:start position:0%
law and that has any alteration of speed
 
01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
limits on state highways or extensions
 
01:40:31.589 --> 01:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
thereof in a municipality by local
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
authorities shall not be effective until
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
such alteration has been approved by the
 
01:40:37.149 --> 01:40:37.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner of
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation does this bill remove
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
Authority

01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so to clarify the the bill creates
 
01:40:59.070 --> 01:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
a process from beginning to end for how
 
01:41:01.390 --> 01:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
the municipality goes about
 
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
this there's no involvement with do and
 
01:41:07.229 --> 01:41:07.239 align:start position:0%
I think the disclaimer in the beginning
 
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
allows them to proceed without talking
 
01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
to do about it much less having do
 
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.109 align:start position:0%
to do about it much less having do
approve

01:41:16.109 --> 01:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
it I'm trying to figure out if I'm
 
01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:55.310 align:start position:0%
it I'm trying to figure out if I'm
right

01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
I think that was part of the point of
 
01:41:57.750 --> 01:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
the bill that you wouldn't have to
 
01:41:59.589 --> 01:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
petition the state because State already
 
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
has the authority to do this that this
 
01:42:03.629 --> 01:42:03.639 align:start position:0%
would be a municipality's prerogative
 
01:42:09.669 --> 01:42:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner this is why we need a
 
01:42:12.990 --> 01:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
15minute break because I'm starting to
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
get a little foggy myself um fair enough
 
01:42:17.589 --> 01:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
is there anybody that can offer to try
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
to answer this if not I'm going to take
 
01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:25.149 --> 01:42:25.159 align:start position:0%
you can try it Mr Lambert thank you
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:28.189 --> 01:42:28.199 align:start position:0%
again I'll give it a try thank you Mr
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
chairman um this bill in the last the
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
last paragraph says that um design
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
construction installation of any
 
01:42:37.709 --> 01:42:37.719 align:start position:0%
seasonal sign it shall be approved by
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of Transportation of
 
01:42:41.430 --> 01:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation so that
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
does have to be approved by the dot uh
 
01:42:45.709 --> 01:42:45.719 align:start position:0%
you could argue that the value of the
 
01:42:47.709 --> 01:42:47.719 align:start position:0%
the speed limit would be part of that
 
01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
signage um so I I I'd be comfortable
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
that we'd be involved in the process if
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
needed but I can tell you that in
 
01:42:59.430 --> 01:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
practice um RSA 26563 that gives a lot
 
01:43:01.470 --> 01:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
of communities the authority to alter
 
01:43:04.510 --> 01:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
speed limits um they do not coordinate
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily with the dot and I had a a
 
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
selectman tell me last week that towns
 
01:43:13.310 --> 01:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
can change the speed limits like that um
 
01:43:16.109 --> 01:43:16.119 align:start position:0%
so as the law has applied it's not
 
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily consistent now so I think
 
01:43:21.189 --> 01:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
this uh as representative V said is
 
01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
intended to give the towns the same
 
01:43:24.669 --> 01:43:24.679 align:start position:0%
Authority on town roads class five roads
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
that the state has on class two and uh
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
one one two and four
 
01:43:32.910 --> 01:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
roads does that answer the question or
 
01:43:35.550 --> 01:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
clarify it to do a degree I bet it
 
01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:46.270 align:start position:0%
 
enough

01:43:46.270 --> 01:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:43:50.030 --> 01:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
um It also says on lines 15- 16 Upon A
 
01:43:51.629 --> 01:43:51.639 align:start position:0%
basis of an Eng engineering and traffic
 
01:43:53.470 --> 01:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
investigation the way this is written
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily mean it'll be
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
you folks does
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
it it does not earlier in article uh in
 
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
RSA 26563 it makes reference to towns
 
01:44:08.109 --> 01:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
and cities um requiring an engineering
 
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
and traffic investigation for any
 
01:44:11.629 --> 01:44:11.639 align:start position:0%
alteration and it says that they uh if
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
they have staff that can conduct such an
 
01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:16.360 align:start position:0%
investigation they do not hire to need
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
to hire Consultants so
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
paragraphs uh 1 through five of RSA
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
26563 cover a lot of those types of
 
01:44:29.470 --> 01:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
things and right so this is what we're
 
01:44:32.229 --> 01:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
going to do because I still want to look
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
into one other thing I said we were
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to take a break after this but
 
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
actually we're going to take a recess
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
right now uh for the recess that I
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to do anyway and to give uh a few
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
minutes to look into some of the
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
outstanding questions so with that said
 
01:44:48.350 --> 01:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
I'm going to recess this executive
 
01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:49.550 align:start position:0%
I'm going to recess this executive
session

01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:53.669 align:start position:0%
session
until

01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:53.679 --> 01:44:56.270 align:start position:0%
 
noon

01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:19.480 --> 02:02:18.790 align:start position:0%
 
now

02:02:18.790 --> 02:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:21.390 --> 02:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
he welcome back everybody we'll resume
 
02:02:25.390 --> 02:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:28.030 --> 02:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
1550 um after looking into a little bit
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
deeper uh I don't think I have any
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
any any U reservations about this it
 
02:02:38.430 --> 02:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
appears that it actually is just using
 
02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
26562 Roman
 
02:02:53.109 --> 02:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
4 sub parag uh no Roman five paragraph
 
02:02:55.870 --> 02:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
a which deals with state roads just
 
02:02:58.270 --> 02:02:58.280 align:start position:0%
taking the same language over to in
 
02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
putting into the alteration of limits in
 
02:03:05.390 --> 02:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
26563 which is Municipal roads um I
 
02:03:06.629 --> 02:03:06.639 align:start position:0%
originally well and thank you
 
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Smith for looking at the
 
02:03:11.310 --> 02:03:11.320 align:start position:0%
the those those terrifying words any
 
02:03:13.709 --> 02:03:13.719 align:start position:0%
other law to the contrary uh I don't
 
02:03:15.390 --> 02:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
think we have anything to worry about in
 
02:03:18.669 --> 02:03:18.679 align:start position:0%
this particular case uh so I'm fine with
 
02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
m moving on with the amendment anybody
 
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
committee okay now um with nothing else
 
02:03:30.189 --> 02:03:30.199 align:start position:0%
from the committee I'll ask the clerk to
 
02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
call the role wait a minute we've
 
02:03:34.030 --> 02:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
already done the amendment okay so this
 
02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass as amended
 
02:03:39.189 --> 02:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
um yeah and I think we're fine at that
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it alone I'll ask the clerk
 
02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
to call the role the motion is ought to
 
02:03:44.069 --> 02:03:44.079 align:start position:0%

02:05:17.679 --> 02:05:57.709 align:start position:0%
 
one

02:05:57.709 --> 02:05:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:58.990 --> 02:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open up the executive
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill would I say
 
02:06:05.229 --> 02:06:05.239 align:start position:0%
1332 FN relative to prohibiting electric
 
02:06:09.229 --> 02:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
vehicles from parking and parking
 
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
motion m wants representative
 
02:06:23.470 --> 02:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
Jones else wants to do it I would
 
02:06:28.109 --> 02:06:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:30.990 --> 02:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
1332 is there a second representative
 
02:06:34.589 --> 02:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
Rich care to speak to your motion
 
02:06:40.709 --> 02:06:40.719 align:start position:0%
sir uh we heard from this um petitioner
 
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
um we didn't hear any testimony from any
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
fire department saying that there was
 
02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
any data against this bill
 
02:06:51.189 --> 02:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
uh I think it just takes away public
 
02:06:53.790 --> 02:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
parking from the public who's entitled
 
02:06:56.189 --> 02:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
to public parking so I I don't just
 
02:06:58.149 --> 02:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
don't see a reason for this
 
02:07:01.709 --> 02:07:01.719 align:start position:0%
bill anybody else from the
 
02:07:04.229 --> 02:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
committee representative sellers thank
 
02:07:07.109 --> 02:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um we did actually do an
 
02:07:09.109 --> 02:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle study not on this one
 
02:07:11.149 --> 02:07:11.159 align:start position:0%
here but uh our representative Schultz
 
02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
was part of it as well we actually
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
gathered a lot of data on it and uh
 
02:07:17.470 --> 02:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of Hazards to have an
 
02:07:19.629 --> 02:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle in a Gar so I'll just
 
02:07:19.639 --> 02:07:24.149 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle in a Gar so I'll just
state

02:07:24.149 --> 02:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:26.750 --> 02:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
02:07:29.669 --> 02:07:29.679 align:start position:0%
Rumbo thank you Mr chairman uh my
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
understanding of the testimony at
 
02:07:31.870 --> 02:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
hearing was that there are a lot of
 
02:07:34.030 --> 02:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
Hazards related to weight there are a
 
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
lot of Hazards related to Old garages
 
02:07:40.549 --> 02:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
there are um hazards related to tires uh
 
02:07:42.229 --> 02:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
and that those are all concerns but they
 
02:07:44.229 --> 02:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
are not specific to EVS there were
 
02:07:47.629 --> 02:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
discussions about batteries um but there
 
02:07:50.830 --> 02:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
we also got further submission um I
 
02:07:55.549 --> 02:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
believe from do um sorry Dees regarding
 
02:07:57.709 --> 02:07:57.719 align:start position:0%
the just lack of data of fires within
 
02:07:59.910 --> 02:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
two car fires I think in New
 
02:08:02.589 --> 02:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um there's approximately
 
02:08:06.109 --> 02:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
12,000 EVS um all vehicles are heavier
 
02:08:08.430 --> 02:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
now um I think there was there was a lot
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
of discussion that this was not an EV
 
02:08:12.270 --> 02:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
problem so much as it was concerns that
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
arise in parking garages um and
 
02:08:17.549 --> 02:08:17.559 align:start position:0%
I uh for that reason I support the itl
 
02:08:18.510 --> 02:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
because I don't think this is the right
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
way to be addressing if we have concerns
 
02:08:21.390 --> 02:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
about parking garage safety that it is
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
not an EV
 
02:08:26.549 --> 02:08:26.559 align:start position:0%
issue representative B thank you Mr
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
chairman um when it comes to car
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
fires U we we heard testimony that the
 
02:08:34.709 --> 02:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
fires are harder to put out that they
 
02:08:37.310 --> 02:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
they burn hotter but as far as they're
 
02:08:39.709 --> 02:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
they're also far far far less
 
02:08:42.030 --> 02:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
likely our gasoline vehicles is like
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
four or five times more likely to catch
 
02:08:47.549 --> 02:08:47.559 align:start position:0%
fire and they are just as likely to
 
02:08:47.559 --> 02:08:49.549 align:start position:0%
fire and they are just as likely to
cause

02:08:49.549 --> 02:08:49.559 align:start position:0%
cause
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
um you know excessive damage within the
 
02:08:54.950 --> 02:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
garage when we look at things like the
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
the channel tunnel fires that shut down
 
02:08:58.950 --> 02:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
the tunnels those were gas vehicles that
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
did that uh any any fire within an En
 
02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
closed space is going to be much hotter
 
02:09:05.870 --> 02:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
than a fire that's outside tires burn at
 
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
2500 degrees gasoline Burns at at 36
 
02:09:12.189 --> 02:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
3700 degrees um
 
02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
so they're they're not easy to put out
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
once they get started uh maybe you could
 
02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
put it out with a with a fire
 
02:09:19.390 --> 02:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
extinguisher where you know in in most
 
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
cases but in most cases by the time you
 
02:09:22.830 --> 02:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
get equipment in there it's going no
 
02:09:24.310 --> 02:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
matter what caused the fire it's going
 
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
to be uh out of control so um I don't
 
02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
think there's any reason to Target
 
02:09:33.270 --> 02:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles or gas powered
 
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles um we if we're looking at
 
02:09:37.470 --> 02:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
weight we should look at the weight of
 
02:09:40.390 --> 02:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh all-wheel drive vehicles versus F two
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
wheel drive vehicles we should look at
 
02:09:45.149 --> 02:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
the weight of uh large SUVs my SEO weigh
 
02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
6,500 lb versus Prius that weighs a
 
02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
couple thousand at most um so as far as
 
02:09:56.669 --> 02:09:56.679 align:start position:0%
weight and and and fire hazard I don't
 
02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
think there's any really any difference
 
02:10:00.189 --> 02:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
in the big
 
02:10:03.189 --> 02:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
picture anybody else from the committee
 
02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz I'll just say
 
02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
since my name was raised by my friend um
 
02:10:11.830 --> 02:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
across the way there that I agree with
 
02:10:14.270 --> 02:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
this remarks of the last two speakers
 
02:10:16.910 --> 02:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
and I feel like characterizing electric
 
02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles in the this way is akin to
 
02:10:23.589 --> 02:10:23.599 align:start position:0%
saying they're like a trabant or a Yugo
 
02:10:26.669 --> 02:10:26.679 align:start position:0%
if you remember those cars and that's
 
02:10:28.830 --> 02:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
just simply not the case they're
 
02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
sophisticated vehicles and I feel like
 
02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
um barriers to electric vehicles like
 
02:10:39.950 --> 02:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
this um hurt the free market among other
 
02:10:43.709 --> 02:10:43.719 align:start position:0%
things and so there's my two
 
02:10:46.470 --> 02:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
cents anybody
 
02:10:48.549 --> 02:10:48.559 align:start position:0%
else well I'll get some going to have to
 
02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
chime in nobody else seems to want to um
 
02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I agree with the
 
02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
arguments that have been put forth this
 
02:10:55.709 --> 02:10:55.719 align:start position:0%
far I have been doing a lot of research
 
02:11:00.229 --> 02:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
on these vehicles um and from what I
 
02:11:01.709 --> 02:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
have found and from what I have seen
 
02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
actually these vehicles are heavier
 
02:11:05.629 --> 02:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
they're comparable internal combustion
 
02:11:08.109 --> 02:11:08.119 align:start position:0%
engine counterparts so from by one and a
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
half to two times as heavy and it's not
 
02:11:12.830 --> 02:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
that there's an issue now when there's
 
02:11:14.910 --> 02:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
only a few electric vehicles the issue
 
02:11:17.910 --> 02:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
is looking at what happens when all of
 
02:11:22.229 --> 02:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
the cars may be uh uh electric are the
 
02:11:24.390 --> 02:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
garages even designed for it I was
 
02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
surprised to find out that I was worried
 
02:11:28.270 --> 02:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
more about the older garages um it's
 
02:11:29.790 --> 02:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
actually the newer garages that are
 
02:11:31.950 --> 02:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
built to a lesser degree of strength
 
02:11:34.390 --> 02:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
than the older ones um so you can look
 
02:11:36.310 --> 02:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
at weight as one thing uh maybe not an
 
02:11:38.149 --> 02:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
issue now but down the road excuse the
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
transportation metaphor um but for me
 
02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
and we have had uh meetings with fire
 
02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
departments including the Fire Marshall
 
02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.599 align:start position:0%
who are expressing a great amount of
 
02:11:50.350 --> 02:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
fear over the electric vehicle fires
 
02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
it's called thermal runaway now these
 
02:11:56.109 --> 02:11:56.119 align:start position:0%
things can take upwards 20 25,000
 
02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
gallons of water to put out it's not
 
02:12:01.390 --> 02:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
like an internal combustion fire uh even
 
02:12:03.189 --> 02:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
though they occur more often obviously
 
02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
they do because there's a lot more of
 
02:12:07.310 --> 02:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
them we're still looking at about 3% of
 
02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
the vehicles being electric um but um
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
they can be put out with a single fire
 
02:12:15.390 --> 02:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
extinguisher in a lot of cases so then
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
you you look at the thermal runaway
 
02:12:20.470 --> 02:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
which can for prolonged periods of time
 
02:12:22.629 --> 02:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
even if you can get a fire engine into
 
02:12:25.629 --> 02:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
the parking garage is a problem um and
 
02:12:28.510 --> 02:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
still need five tankers to put one out
 
02:12:30.350 --> 02:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh what happens to the steel what
 
02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
happens to the structure are we going to
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
risk the whole parking garage we've all
 
02:12:38.709 --> 02:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
seen what happens when metal gets uh uh
 
02:12:42.709 --> 02:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
baked if you will by intense fires so
 
02:12:44.950 --> 02:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
again is this problem now with the with
 
02:12:46.709 --> 02:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
the few vehicles that are out there
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
probably not the odds in the favor of
 
02:12:52.030 --> 02:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
not an issue probably what's going to
 
02:12:55.470 --> 02:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
happen the more these things become
 
02:12:58.589 --> 02:12:58.599 align:start position:0%
popular so uh I'm impelled to support
 
02:13:02.350 --> 02:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
the bill only because if it happens once
 
02:13:04.870 --> 02:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
I think it's too many too many times and
 
02:13:06.430 --> 02:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
I haven't even mentioned what happens
 
02:13:08.430 --> 02:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
when you have 20,000 gallons of
 
02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
contaminated water where does that go
 
02:13:12.790 --> 02:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
down the onramps of a garage what
 
02:13:14.589 --> 02:13:14.599 align:start position:0%
happens to the fumes that are trapped
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
underneath the roof from the floor above
 
02:13:21.189 --> 02:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
all I can say is that if I see a Prius
 
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
going up I'm going to run for my life
 
02:13:24.910 --> 02:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
and let's hope the building stands
 
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the
 
02:13:30.189 --> 02:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
committee represent Fox thank you Mr
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:38.510 --> 02:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh there were no instances in New
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we're looking at a again a
 
02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
exist I will say there are other states
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
Connecticut being one of them that have
 
02:13:52.350 --> 02:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
already started doing this same thing so
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's not like we're breaking any ground
 
02:13:56.310 --> 02:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
here with this Theory uh anybody else
 
02:13:58.229 --> 02:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative a did
 
02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
I see your hand go up or no okay anybody
 
02:14:05.910 --> 02:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
else from the committee on this bill
 
02:14:08.990 --> 02:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
02:14:11.149 --> 02:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
the role when she's ready the motion is
 
02:14:15.709 --> 02:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
ought to uh it where am
 
02:14:18.549 --> 02:14:18.559 align:start position:0%
I oh yeah inexpedient to let late on
 
02:14:19.750 --> 02:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
1332 was this motion on OTP no none of
 
02:14:25.750 --> 02:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
our side wanted to give me the OTP so
 
02:14:27.709 --> 02:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
they got the first stab at it in
 
02:14:28.990 --> 02:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
expedient to
 
02:14:32.709 --> 02:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
legislate uh Vice chairman Gorski
 
02:14:32.719 --> 02:14:35.270 align:start position:0%
legislate uh Vice chairman Gorski
yes

02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:36.830 align:start position:0%
yes
no

02:14:36.830 --> 02:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:38.390 align:start position:0%
no
no

02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:14:42.910 --> 02:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative Smith no clerk votes
 
02:14:45.390 --> 02:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
no representative Hill no representative
 
02:14:48.750 --> 02:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
Dees no representative Coker no
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
representative foot no representative C
 
02:14:55.709 --> 02:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
no Representative sers no representative
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
Sykes yes representative BR yes
 
02:15:01.149 --> 02:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair yes
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
representative Fox yes representative
 
02:15:05.950 --> 02:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
rmo yes representative U yes
 
02:15:07.950 --> 02:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
representative Jones yes representative
 
02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
Schulz yes representative kundan yes and
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:18.589 align:start position:0%
 
no

02:15:18.589 --> 02:15:18.599 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:15:22.189 --> 02:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
nine to 10 so the motion of inexpedient
 
02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
to legislate fails is there another
 
02:15:28.669 --> 02:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
motion representative sers thank you Mr
 
02:15:30.549 --> 02:15:30.559 align:start position:0%
chair I'll make a motion not to pass
 
02:15:33.069 --> 02:15:33.079 align:start position:0%
motion is not to pass is there a
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
second second by representative Hill any
 
02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
further discussion or can we move into
 
02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
the roll call Representative s thank you
 
02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:42.229 align:start position:0%
the roll call Representative s thank you
Mr

02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
02:15:47.229 --> 02:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
chairman so I'm just going to say this
 
02:15:47.239 --> 02:15:50.629 align:start position:0%
chairman so I'm just going to say this
um

02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:52.669 --> 02:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
I believe that this is a bill that is
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
chasing a problem that does not exist
 
02:15:58.390 --> 02:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
and I can say that with great deal of
 
02:16:01.470 --> 02:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
confidence um for those of you who know
 
02:16:04.270 --> 02:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
me I have 28 years of experience in the
 
02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:05.229 align:start position:0%
me I have 28 years of experience in the
fire

02:16:05.229 --> 02:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
fire
 
02:16:10.030 --> 02:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
service and on top of that the last 20
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
of which or nearly 20 the last 17 of
 
02:16:16.109 --> 02:16:16.119 align:start position:0%
which were as a fire prevention officer
 
02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
whose job was to review architectural
 
02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
plans fire protection plans and parking
 
02:16:25.229 --> 02:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
garages are part of that that
 
02:16:29.790 --> 02:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
issue all of the fears and that's just
 
02:16:31.629 --> 02:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
what they are all of the fears that have
 
02:16:33.950 --> 02:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
been expressed during the previous
 
02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
discussion are no more than that their
 
02:16:37.830 --> 02:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
fears of something that hasn't happened
 
02:16:39.669 --> 02:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
yet and
 
02:16:45.910 --> 02:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
yes cars do burn in garages and yes
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
there is runoff and yes yes there are
 
02:16:50.589 --> 02:16:50.599 align:start position:0%
all the associated problems that we're
 
02:16:53.629 --> 02:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
talking about but for the moment if we
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
were to use the logic that this is
 
02:16:58.669 --> 02:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
something we need to be worried about we
 
02:17:00.830 --> 02:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
would Banning we would be banning all
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
cars from parking garages we forget that
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
most parking garages constructed within
 
02:17:10.830 --> 02:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
the last 30 years have an open air
 
02:17:14.190 --> 02:17:14.200 align:start position:0%
requirement and most of them if not all
 
02:17:18.270 --> 02:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
of them now new require a sprink system
 
02:17:20.790 --> 02:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
which would help with the early stages
 
02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
of new new not all of them but many of
 
02:17:29.469 --> 02:17:29.479 align:start position:0%
them and I just think that this is I
 
02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
think we are treading into Waters where
 
02:17:36.150 --> 02:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
we where um it
 
02:17:39.509 --> 02:17:39.519 align:start position:0%
is not facts but rather emotions that
 
02:17:42.070 --> 02:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
are ruling our votes and I I would urge
 
02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:49.870 --> 02:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
lotp anybody else from the
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
committee I gu up representative
 
02:17:57.190 --> 02:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
pondon I was too slow to act no wasn't
 
02:17:59.750 --> 02:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
going to speak on it but way I view this
 
02:18:02.030 --> 02:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
is parking garages they're either
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
privately owned municipally owned or
 
02:18:07.509 --> 02:18:07.519 align:start position:0%
state-owned and there's different ages
 
02:18:09.870 --> 02:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
and constructions and I believe it's up
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
to those owning entities to
 
02:18:12.719 --> 02:18:14.349 align:start position:0%
to those owning entities to
regulate

02:18:14.349 --> 02:18:14.359 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
02:18:17.230 --> 02:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
limitations uh based on the structural
 
02:18:19.950 --> 02:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
Eng engers of that particular structure
 
02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh the fire apparatus of that Community
 
02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should my view I don't
 
02:18:27.150 --> 02:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
think we should blanket legislation
 
02:18:29.190 --> 02:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
Statewide on parking garages when
 
02:18:32.429 --> 02:18:32.439 align:start position:0%
there's entities owning entities that
 
02:18:34.349 --> 02:18:34.359 align:start position:0%
really could could you know like a
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
hospital they could enforce Their Own no
 
02:18:40.549 --> 02:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
El electric vehicles or vehicle height
 
02:18:44.589 --> 02:18:44.599 align:start position:0%
they limit vehicle weight they limit so
 
02:18:46.389 --> 02:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
I think we're kind of chasing something
 
02:18:47.910 --> 02:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
that we don't need to at at this point
 
02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
in time thank you Mr
 
02:18:52.270 --> 02:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
chair anybody
 
02:18:55.110 --> 02:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
else represent sellers thank you Mr
 
02:18:56.669 --> 02:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
chair I'm just trying to understand the
 
02:18:59.629 --> 02:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
logic here because a few bills ago we
 
02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
were trying to you know keep cigarette
 
02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
smoke out of cars and be preventative
 
02:19:06.830 --> 02:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
and now we're trying to be preventative
 
02:19:08.990 --> 02:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
here and and it's it's it's almost like
 
02:19:10.750 --> 02:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
two ways and and I don't understand it
 
02:19:13.589 --> 02:19:13.599 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to figure out what's
 
02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
we're prevented one and not preventing
 
02:19:16.270 --> 02:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
the other we're preventing the other and
 
02:19:17.709 --> 02:19:17.719 align:start position:0%
not the other you know it's a little
 
02:19:19.910 --> 02:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
confusing that's
 
02:19:23.070 --> 02:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
all fair enough I don't see anything
 
02:19:25.150 --> 02:19:25.160 align:start position:0%
else anybody else from the committee so
 
02:19:28.469 --> 02:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
without beling it I'll um ask the clerk
 
02:19:31.309 --> 02:19:31.319 align:start position:0%

02:21:49.750 --> 02:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
essentially this bill hold on hold on
 
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion on the floor is uh to
 
02:21:54.790 --> 02:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
pass is there a second represent by
 
02:21:56.230 --> 02:21:56.240 align:start position:0%

speak your motion thank you yes CARiD um
 
02:22:05.349 --> 02:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
so this bill looks to extend um the
 
02:22:07.190 --> 02:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for surviving spouses of
 
02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
veterans to extend a license plate
 
02:22:11.349 --> 02:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
indefinitely currently as it sits right
 
02:22:14.190 --> 02:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
now um they have one year to surrender
 
02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
those plates to the DMV um
 
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
um and we heard testimony from the state
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
veterans advisory committee who also
 
02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
supported this and from my understanding
 
02:22:27.790 --> 02:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
that's that was a a big plus to hear
 
02:22:32.030 --> 02:22:32.040 align:start position:0%

02:25:00.110 --> 02:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
motions I'll give it one more shot
 
02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
02:25:05.510 --> 02:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
Rich representative Rich moves out the
 
02:25:09.469 --> 02:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
pass is there a second second
 
02:25:12.830 --> 02:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
B I saw rbo first doesn't matter
 
02:25:14.990 --> 02:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
represent seconded by representative rbo
 
02:25:16.110 --> 02:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
would you can't speak to your motion
 
02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
fair enough thank you anybody else from
 
02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.230 align:start position:0%
fair enough thank you anybody else from
the

02:25:33.230 --> 02:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:36.070 --> 02:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill I'm still
 
02:25:38.710 --> 02:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
puzzled I have to admit why uh a
 
02:25:42.469 --> 02:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
municipal plate doesn't solve the same
 
02:25:44.510 --> 02:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
the the current plate that they have
 
02:25:47.070 --> 02:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't do I I don't see the point point
 
02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
of a fire plate um anyone that sees a
 
02:25:52.070 --> 02:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
fire truck coming down the road is going
 
02:25:54.510 --> 02:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
to not look at their plate and then hold
 
02:25:56.150 --> 02:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
them up because they have a municipal
 
02:25:58.030 --> 02:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
plate rather than a fire plate as far as
 
02:26:00.110 --> 02:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
I can see
 
02:26:02.950 --> 02:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
but I don't I don't I guess I don't
 
02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:08.830 --> 02:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
much representative rbo I would add on
 
02:26:10.030 --> 02:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
to that I do think there was a little
 
02:26:12.670 --> 02:26:12.680 align:start position:0%
bit of confusion um potentially about
 
02:26:13.710 --> 02:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
there was discussion in the hearings
 
02:26:15.389 --> 02:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
about what what vehicles these would be
 
02:26:17.590 --> 02:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
on but I I guess I came the conclusion
 
02:26:20.190 --> 02:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
that this is just adding fire to the
 
02:26:21.670 --> 02:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are already permitted
 
02:26:22.910 --> 02:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
under statute and make it more
 
02:26:25.070 --> 02:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
consistent among among the different
 
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
bodies so uh I made my peace with
 
02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
it yeah from what I understand the fire
 
02:26:33.389 --> 02:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
trucks right now fire vehicles municipal
 
02:26:35.910 --> 02:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
fire vehicles still you run a municipal
 
02:26:38.750 --> 02:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
plate it just doesn't say fire like the
 
02:26:41.429 --> 02:26:41.439 align:start position:0%
police do they have their own plate and
 
02:26:43.070 --> 02:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
we didn't get an answer on why they have
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
one and fire does not um but that's
 
02:26:48.429 --> 02:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
where it's at anybody else from the
 
02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
committee representative Smith actually
 
02:26:54.750 --> 02:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
inquiry of the chair um are these
 
02:26:57.950 --> 02:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
vehicles registered directly through the
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
state or through the
 
02:27:03.309 --> 02:27:03.319 align:start position:0%
municipality let me look into it hold on
 
02:27:03.319 --> 02:27:15.710 align:start position:0%
municipality let me look into it hold on
good

02:27:15.710 --> 02:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:18.070 align:start position:0%
 
question

02:27:18.070 --> 02:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:27:19.389 --> 02:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
we have the prime sponsor here would you
 
02:27:22.030 --> 02:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
like to help us with that question come
 
02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:31.150 align:start position:0%
like to help us with that question come
on

02:27:31.150 --> 02:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:34.030 --> 02:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
up I believe at this moment they go
 
02:27:35.790 --> 02:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
through the municipality we go to our
 
02:27:41.429 --> 02:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:44.550 --> 02:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
us represent Smith thank you for that Mr
 
02:27:46.510 --> 02:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
chair unfortunately then the fiscal note
 
02:27:50.150 --> 02:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
is is way way way off um it refers to
 
02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
the testing for adding the new field in
 
02:27:55.150 --> 02:27:55.160 align:start position:0%
the database for the pl type with the
 
02:27:58.429 --> 02:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
state systems but as longtime members of
 
02:28:00.030 --> 02:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
the committee are aware the state then
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
is also responsible for the update to
 
02:28:05.309 --> 02:28:05.319 align:start position:0%
all the municipality software there's
 
02:28:08.110 --> 02:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
five different vendors and the last time
 
02:28:11.469 --> 02:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
I saw a number there should actually be
 
02:28:15.150 --> 02:28:15.160 align:start position:0%
around 1,600 hours of implementation and
 
02:28:18.190 --> 02:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
testing not
 
02:28:19.510 --> 02:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
what do they have
 
02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:25.150 --> 02:28:25.160 align:start position:0%
40 yeah
 
02:28:28.469 --> 02:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
so the price tag for a new plate for
 
02:28:31.190 --> 02:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
years because of the um the state's
 
02:28:33.070 --> 02:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility to pay the municipalities
 
02:28:35.230 --> 02:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
for the upgrade and test is typically
 
02:28:39.309 --> 02:28:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:42.110 --> 02:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
Grand it did you have a question
 
02:28:44.510 --> 02:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
represent s Yeah question to the chair
 
02:28:46.349 --> 02:28:46.359 align:start position:0%
is it possible to hear from the DMV for
 
02:28:48.510 --> 02:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
cl clarification I mean the fiscal note
 
02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
is what it is but if it's wrong then we
 
02:28:53.190 --> 02:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps he can provide guidance here
 
02:28:54.469 --> 02:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
that was my next
 
02:28:58.590 --> 02:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
move you Chim in anybody from Department
 
02:29:00.910 --> 02:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles can you
 
02:29:03.230 --> 02:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
tell us who wrote the fful
 
02:29:06.510 --> 02:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
note good afternoon I'm Kathy Diamond
 
02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
the supervisor at the DMV in the
 
02:29:10.150 --> 02:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
registration department so just want to
 
02:29:12.110 --> 02:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
clarify the first question that you had
 
02:29:14.590 --> 02:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
was do Municipal agents register these
 
02:29:16.750 --> 02:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
the fire tracks They don't they do the
 
02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
town portion which is no fee because
 
02:29:20.429 --> 02:29:20.439 align:start position:0%
it's a perm plate and they don't have
 
02:29:22.269 --> 02:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
those plate types in their office so
 
02:29:24.309 --> 02:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
they have to finish with us they can
 
02:29:26.630 --> 02:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
renew them um no they can't even renew
 
02:29:28.309 --> 02:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
them because the a perm plate so first
 
02:29:30.750 --> 02:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
time issuance comes to us we renew them
 
02:29:33.190 --> 02:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
all right now as well and one of the
 
02:29:36.030 --> 02:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
questions that I had before was if um I
 
02:29:37.429 --> 02:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
know you spoke about having it to the
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
volunteer people as well volunteer
 
02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
firefighters but with that if they were
 
02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
to get a perm plate there'd be no fees
 
02:29:46.870 --> 02:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
for them so they'd have their personal
 
02:29:49.070 --> 02:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle with a fire department plate on
 
02:29:54.349 --> 02:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:54.359 --> 02:29:56.630 align:start position:0%
 
fees

02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
fees
 
02:29:58.710 --> 02:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
okay yeah what about the fiscal note
 
02:30:00.030 --> 02:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
itself are you saying that is accurate
 
02:30:01.150 --> 02:30:01.160 align:start position:0%
or inaccurate I didn't hear what the
 
02:30:03.469 --> 02:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal note was it's about $25,000
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
28,000 and the only Department the only
 
02:30:07.230 --> 02:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
Department was Department of Safety that
 
02:30:11.910 --> 02:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:13.870 --> 02:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
correct any other
 
02:30:17.910 --> 02:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
questions rep representative Jones
 
02:30:20.510 --> 02:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm hearing two different stories
 
02:30:23.710 --> 02:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
uh I just heard that fire firefighters
 
02:30:26.070 --> 02:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
can have it on their personal but I
 
02:30:28.670 --> 02:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
didn't the bill it said was only
 
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
fire fire trucks
 
02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
fire when I when I was listening to the
 
02:30:34.950 --> 02:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
last um meeting that you had somebody
 
02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
had brought up could they have it on
 
02:30:38.830 --> 02:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
their the volunteer firefighters have it
 
02:30:41.790 --> 02:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
on their personal vehicle and I heard no
 
02:30:43.590 --> 02:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
okay just making sure I just want to
 
02:30:45.910 --> 02:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
make sure I was no okay that that's what
 
02:30:47.429 --> 02:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
I had heard to I thought Municipal
 
02:30:48.790 --> 02:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
Vehicles only just for municipal
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
Vehicles okay so the last statement you
 
02:30:52.429 --> 02:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
made about the volunteer fire
 
02:30:54.870 --> 02:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
department's having plates with no fee
 
02:30:57.950 --> 02:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply correct okay anybody else
 
02:30:59.269 --> 02:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
from the committee questions for the
 
02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles
 
02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
representative Hill um so do they um I'm
 
02:31:08.830 --> 02:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
trying to resolve uh the difference
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
between what I heard from represent
 
02:31:14.870 --> 02:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
Smith and that is there is there a cost
 
02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
to creating this new
 
02:31:20.030 --> 02:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
plate that uh doesn't isn't reflective
 
02:31:21.910 --> 02:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
of the in the fiscal
 
02:31:25.510 --> 02:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
note there would be a cost about $25,000
 
02:31:26.670 --> 02:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
because we would have to certify the
 
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
vendors that we have and as well as
 
02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
testing and the creation of the plate
 
02:31:34.550 --> 02:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
itself so let me let me ask this
 
02:31:36.150 --> 02:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
question because I agree with
 
02:31:37.630 --> 02:31:37.640 align:start position:0%
representative Smith when he says that
 
02:31:40.030 --> 02:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
the price or the cost for a new plate
 
02:31:43.030 --> 02:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
with all the programming used to be much
 
02:31:44.870 --> 02:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
much more has something changed at the
 
02:31:47.309 --> 02:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles uh not to
 
02:31:49.269 --> 02:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
my knowledge no it hasn't and those are
 
02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
numbers that I got recently
 
02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:55.630 align:start position:0%
numbers that I got recently
representative

02:31:55.630 --> 02:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.790 --> 02:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
Smith yeah yeah I just want to make sure
 
02:32:00.309 --> 02:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
I have it right so the municipal
 
02:32:03.429 --> 02:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
software does not need an update under
 
02:32:05.630 --> 02:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
this bill it would need an update but
 
02:32:07.309 --> 02:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
it's something that we would do and push
 
02:32:09.110 --> 02:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
it out to
 
02:32:12.230 --> 02:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
them follow up follow
 
02:32:15.750 --> 02:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
up so you're able to push updates to the

second seconded by representative Coker
 
02:37:21.870 --> 02:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
care to speak to
 
02:37:23.870 --> 02:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
motion yeah I think this is one we
 
02:37:26.510 --> 02:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
really didn't have much testimony on the
 
02:37:28.870 --> 02:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
U the prime sponsor did was not here to
 
02:37:31.429 --> 02:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
introduce it and um without having more
 
02:37:34.750 --> 02:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
information I would be hesitant to uh
 
02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
support any other
 
02:37:39.150 --> 02:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
motion anybody else from the
 
02:37:42.510 --> 02:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
committee also we we had a slew of bills
 
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
that dealt with titles but the one that
 
02:37:46.070 --> 02:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
we did recommend for passing Mage
 
02:37:47.670 --> 02:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
actually took it away from the static
 
02:37:49.590 --> 02:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
date and brought it into 20 I would
 
02:37:50.950 --> 02:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
suspect that a lot of the other ones we
 
02:37:52.990 --> 02:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
saw may not be needed now that we've
 
02:37:54.510 --> 02:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
taken that action let's hope that one
 
02:37:57.110 --> 02:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
stands or our action stands anybody else
 
02:38:00.030 --> 02:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
from the committee seeing none uh I'll
 
02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:04.240 align:start position:0%

to Roman numeral 2 what I found in the
 
03:11:16.630 --> 03:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
statute was a hodgepodge if you look
 
03:11:19.550 --> 03:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
down where the strikeouts are of
 
03:11:22.269 --> 03:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
identifying the people the supplies to
 
03:11:23.950 --> 03:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
figuring out how to determine if they
 
03:11:25.550 --> 03:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
know how to drive a
 
03:11:28.510 --> 03:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
car uh identification and it was all
 
03:11:31.590 --> 03:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
mixed up very hard to
 
03:11:35.670 --> 03:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
read the provisions that the director
 
03:11:37.590 --> 03:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
may use to determine if the person knows
 
03:11:40.190 --> 03:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
how to drive have all been moved to
 
03:11:41.750 --> 03:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral
 
03:11:41.760 --> 03:11:45.630 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral
2A

03:11:45.630 --> 03:11:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:47.670 --> 03:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
previously in the statute all these
 
03:11:49.630 --> 03:11:49.640 align:start position:0%
things were already listed they're in
 
03:11:52.070 --> 03:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
current law right now um but the
 
03:11:53.710 --> 03:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
director actually wasn't required to do
 
03:11:55.870 --> 03:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
any of them which seems silly some
 
03:11:57.910 --> 03:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
previous iteration of this committee
 
03:11:59.950 --> 03:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
came up with all these methods and then
 
03:12:03.070 --> 03:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
forgot to say oh and by the way use them
 
03:12:07.590 --> 03:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
um leaving the may as it was though that
 
03:12:11.269 --> 03:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
means you could do all of them so to
 
03:12:13.030 --> 03:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
address the director's testimony that
 
03:12:15.309 --> 03:12:15.319 align:start position:0%
some future nefarious director might
 
03:12:16.990 --> 03:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
choose the one that makes it really hard
 
03:12:19.469 --> 03:12:19.479 align:start position:0%
for people to get these licenses um
 
03:12:21.150 --> 03:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
that's a separate issue for a separate
 
03:12:22.830 --> 03:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
bill and not relevant to this that I'm
 
03:12:25.710 --> 03:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
happy to talk about and file on the fall
 
03:12:28.429 --> 03:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
because the reality is that same
 
03:12:30.790 --> 03:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
nefarious future director could do all
 
03:12:32.950 --> 03:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
of these things to somebody and make
 
03:12:35.870 --> 03:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
them produce all of it uh we just want
 
03:12:38.630 --> 03:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
to know they know how to drive
 
03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
so I doubt that uh the director himself
 
03:12:45.830 --> 03:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
or the commissioner as a supervisor
 
03:12:47.750 --> 03:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
would allow this to be misused and as
 
03:12:50.630 --> 03:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
far as I know it hasn't been we just
 
03:12:52.070 --> 03:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
want the law to be clear that one of
 
03:12:54.469 --> 03:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
these things should
 
03:12:57.469 --> 03:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
occur and that is the only change to
 
03:12:57.479 --> 03:12:58.550 align:start position:0%
occur and that is the only change to
that

03:12:58.550 --> 03:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:13:00.710 --> 03:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
section thank you Mr
 
03:13:03.309 --> 03:13:03.319 align:start position:0%
chair yep thank you and I'll speak to
 
03:13:05.790 --> 03:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
the rest of the amendment um it's
 
03:13:07.950 --> 03:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
actually lengthy but it's it's really
 
03:13:10.389 --> 03:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
not earth shattering uh it basically
 
03:13:10.399 --> 03:13:11.229 align:start position:0%
not earth shattering uh it basically
just

03:13:11.229 --> 03:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:13:13.990 --> 03:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
codifies uh policies that we actually
 
03:13:17.030 --> 03:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
already have and clarifies so if you see
 
03:13:20.030 --> 03:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
on line 25 on the amendment uh it just
 
03:13:22.630 --> 03:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
puts in rating and to make it clear that
 
03:13:24.150 --> 03:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
these issue these driver's license
 
03:13:26.389 --> 03:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
issued to non-resident aliens are not
 
03:13:28.590 --> 03:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
considered valid identification for
 
03:13:30.950 --> 03:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
identity residence or state voter
 
03:13:33.710 --> 03:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
registration to follow that up uh in a
 
03:13:37.950 --> 03:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
new paragraph um it simply uh requires
 
03:13:40.750 --> 03:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
the director to find a place on the
 
03:13:43.630 --> 03:13:43.640 align:start position:0%
license uh and be marking indicating
 
03:13:45.870 --> 03:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
that the non-resident aliens driver's
 
03:13:48.269 --> 03:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
license isn't for voting purposes and
 
03:13:49.950 --> 03:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
this is merely to make things easier at
 
03:13:51.389 --> 03:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
the polls for the
 
03:13:54.229 --> 03:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
volunteers um the other thing that it
 
03:13:58.469 --> 03:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
does it's again just a clarification and
 
03:14:00.910 --> 03:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
um is what we've been hearing from the
 
03:14:02.790 --> 03:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
department and their policies to this
 
03:14:05.950 --> 03:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
point um is that uh if you see on page
 
03:14:09.630 --> 03:14:09.640 align:start position:0%
two line
 
03:14:13.229 --> 03:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
10 um driver licenses to an on resident
 
03:14:15.229 --> 03:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
alien a a
 
03:14:17.790 --> 03:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
refugee um commissioner shaugh issue a
 
03:14:20.510 --> 03:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
driver's license until the refugee or S
 
03:14:24.150 --> 03:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
status is complete um and that's that's
 
03:14:27.870 --> 03:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
prudent to do because we don't know just
 
03:14:29.349 --> 03:14:29.359 align:start position:0%
based on them coming through the Port of
 
03:14:31.710 --> 03:14:31.720 align:start position:0%
Entry who these people are so this is
 
03:14:33.110 --> 03:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
once you get your permanent residency
 
03:14:35.550 --> 03:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
card your green card you're good to go
 
03:14:38.070 --> 03:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh and it does look at the federal
 
03:14:40.510 --> 03:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
government's issuance of temporary work
 
03:14:43.110 --> 03:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
authorizations as a way around to this
 
03:14:46.190 --> 03:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
and says that those uh are not U
 
03:14:48.910 --> 03:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
recognized so it really isn't Earth
 
03:14:51.229 --> 03:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
chattering it's just putting things into
 
03:14:53.229 --> 03:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
statute that we are already
 
03:14:58.790 --> 03:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:05.389 --> 03:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:07.590 --> 03:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
amendment well no questions I mean any
 
03:15:11.389 --> 03:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:11.399 --> 03:15:14.429 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

03:15:14.429 --> 03:15:14.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:18.670 --> 03:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
soes represent Mr chairman so um on the
 
03:15:22.349 --> 03:15:22.359 align:start position:0%
amendment page two lines 10
 
03:15:27.790 --> 03:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
through uh 14 is what I'm looking at um
 
03:15:30.469 --> 03:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the current you
 
03:15:33.750 --> 03:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
you know the current practice for the
 
03:15:36.110 --> 03:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
DMV is that if a person comes into the
 
03:15:39.189 --> 03:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
United States applies for
 
03:15:41.790 --> 03:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
Asylum and then after a period of time
 
03:15:43.070 --> 03:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
the federal government government gives
 
03:15:46.670 --> 03:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
that person a work permit they are then
 
03:15:48.790 --> 03:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to get a driver's license and if
 
03:15:50.910 --> 03:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
I read this correctly it says that they
 
03:15:53.790 --> 03:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
can't do that anymore in the future and
 
03:15:55.590 --> 03:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
that would
 
03:15:58.429 --> 03:15:58.439 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise many many many people who
 
03:16:02.830 --> 03:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
are um driving while lawfully in the
 
03:16:02.840 --> 03:16:06.990 align:start position:0%
are um driving while lawfully in the
United

03:16:06.990 --> 03:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:09.429 --> 03:16:09.439 align:start position:0%
States Al Al director did you want to
 
03:16:11.590 --> 03:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
clarify what you're doing now based on
 
03:16:23.670 --> 03:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:26.790 --> 03:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
it hold on director one second I I did I
 
03:16:31.229 --> 03:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
did miss a hand of the amendment yes y
 
03:16:31.239 --> 03:16:32.670 align:start position:0%
did miss a hand of the amendment yes y
That's

03:16:32.670 --> 03:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
That's
 
03:16:35.590 --> 03:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
what yeah that language is existing law
 
03:16:37.990 --> 03:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm not sure what the concerns
 
03:16:40.229 --> 03:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
have to do with the amendment they are
 
03:16:44.550 --> 03:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:47.910 --> 03:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:51.710 --> 03:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
sure we can confirm that yeah we we'll
 
03:16:53.030 --> 03:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
we'll confirm that but in the meantime
 
03:16:54.550 --> 03:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
the I asked the director to come up to
 
03:16:56.910 --> 03:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
confirm whether or not we were issuing
 
03:16:58.830 --> 03:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses to people with pending
 
03:17:02.429 --> 03:17:02.439 align:start position:0%
cases which is what I heard we are not
 
03:17:04.349 --> 03:17:04.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman John morasco
 
03:17:05.790 --> 03:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire Division
 
03:17:07.429 --> 03:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles along with
 
03:17:10.950 --> 03:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
administrator Jennifer Bailey um as
 
03:17:13.389 --> 03:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
we've discussed before um until the
 
03:17:16.950 --> 03:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
process is complete through USCIS um we
 
03:17:20.550 --> 03:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
do not issue uh a traditional or a real
 
03:17:25.349 --> 03:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:27.550 --> 03:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
Ayes so the point that representative
 
03:17:29.670 --> 03:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
SES brought up are you issuing driver's
 
03:17:33.189 --> 03:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
licenses to pending asy or Refugee
 
03:17:35.389 --> 03:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
status individuals that get a temporary
 
03:17:37.550 --> 03:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
work authorization from the federal
 
03:17:40.510 --> 03:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
government if they have an um a valid
 
03:17:42.189 --> 03:17:42.199 align:start position:0%
work authorization card we do issue a
 
03:17:44.030 --> 03:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
license to them because that is their
 
03:17:46.309 --> 03:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
valid status at that time we're solely
 
03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
talking about not issuing to those that
 
03:17:50.389 --> 03:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
are in pending status of getting
 
03:17:53.150 --> 03:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
anything with the United States they
 
03:17:55.830 --> 03:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
don't have they just have um like a
 
03:17:58.269 --> 03:17:58.279 align:start position:0%
receipt notice they've applied for their
 
03:18:00.990 --> 03:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
Asylum status we would not issue them
 
03:18:02.269 --> 03:18:02.279 align:start position:0%
they have to either have the work
 
03:18:05.309 --> 03:18:05.319 align:start position:0%
employment card or their I94 say and
 
03:18:07.590 --> 03:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
they are entered in as in
 
03:18:12.189 --> 03:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
the but I thought the the the case say
 
03:18:14.309 --> 03:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
Asylum for example that these were
 
03:18:16.269 --> 03:18:16.279 align:start position:0%
temporary work authorizations issued by
 
03:18:17.790 --> 03:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
the federal government because they have
 
03:18:21.510 --> 03:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
to wait for their Asylum um hearings to
 
03:18:23.469 --> 03:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
be completed which we've heard can take
 
03:18:26.269 --> 03:18:26.279 align:start position:0%
a year or longer or up to 10 years so I
 
03:18:28.070 --> 03:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
believe what was testified on was that
 
03:18:30.750 --> 03:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
they after so many like after a year of
 
03:18:33.189 --> 03:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
waiting they get granted a work
 
03:18:35.630 --> 03:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
authorization card they don't get that
 
03:18:37.550 --> 03:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
rate off upon entering they go through
 
03:18:39.630 --> 03:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
the process if there's a weight period
 
03:18:41.710 --> 03:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
and their identity is determined that
 
03:18:43.790 --> 03:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
their eligible to be in us they can get
 
03:18:46.750 --> 03:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
a work authorization card to work and
 
03:18:49.990 --> 03:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
while their Asylum status is
 
03:18:52.429 --> 03:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
granted because Asylum does grant them
 
03:18:56.110 --> 03:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
different um authorities in the United
 
03:18:58.710 --> 03:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
States but in in
 
03:19:00.750 --> 03:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
summation when they get that temporary
 
03:19:03.590 --> 03:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
work authorization their Asylum case in
 
03:19:05.389 --> 03:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
most cases is still pending still
 
03:19:08.229 --> 03:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
pending thank you I represent s did you
 
03:19:10.269 --> 03:19:10.279 align:start position:0%
have another state another question well
 
03:19:12.229 --> 03:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I want I just want to follow up if
 
03:19:16.990 --> 03:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
this new section is contrary to that
 
03:19:19.189 --> 03:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
practice I'm I'm trying to make it clear
 
03:19:22.830 --> 03:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
in my own head whether it is or is
 
03:19:25.150 --> 03:19:25.160 align:start position:0%
not I'll let Jen look at that if I may
 
03:19:27.550 --> 03:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
sir could I just um Mr chairman go back
 
03:19:30.630 --> 03:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
on the um the question about the status
 
03:19:32.750 --> 03:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
so the save database is the federal
 
03:19:35.429 --> 03:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
database that we use uh to query anybody
 
03:19:37.550 --> 03:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
that comes in to make sure that um they
 
03:19:40.070 --> 03:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
have that they've been vetted and they
 
03:19:42.550 --> 03:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
have the status in order for us to to
 
03:19:46.150 --> 03:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
issue either a traditional or um a real
 
03:19:48.070 --> 03:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
ID because they've satisfied everything
 
03:19:49.590 --> 03:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
through the federal government which can
 
03:19:52.349 --> 03:19:52.359 align:start position:0%
take upwards and over a year in in many
 
03:19:54.630 --> 03:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
cases so um but that's what we use so
 
03:19:56.349 --> 03:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
the federal government has listed it as
 
03:19:57.710 --> 03:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
they've completed the process and the
 
03:19:59.830 --> 03:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
same database that is what we're relying
 
03:20:01.510 --> 03:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
on to make that
 
03:20:04.870 --> 03:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
determination and this last sentence
 
03:20:06.790 --> 03:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
well the last section regardless of any
 
03:20:08.389 --> 03:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
prior employment authorization would
 
03:20:10.710 --> 03:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
contradict what we're doing and there
 
03:20:12.670 --> 03:20:12.680 align:start position:0%
would have to be other
 
03:20:15.590 --> 03:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
um law and Rule updates if we were to go
 
03:20:15.600 --> 03:20:16.790 align:start position:0%
um law and Rule updates if we were to go
by

03:20:16.790 --> 03:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:20:19.830 --> 03:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
that fair enough anybody
 
03:20:22.269 --> 03:20:22.279 align:start position:0%
else they're saying it is
 
03:20:23.910 --> 03:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
contradictory and I'm saying it's
 
03:20:25.790 --> 03:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
probably not a bad idea that it is
 
03:20:28.229 --> 03:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
contradictory um because at some point
 
03:20:29.790 --> 03:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
we still even though the federal
 
03:20:33.070 --> 03:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
government decides to give an asy Seeker
 
03:20:34.269 --> 03:20:34.279 align:start position:0%
uh who came
 
03:20:38.189 --> 03:20:38.199 align:start position:0%
through a um Port of Entry provided a
 
03:20:40.150 --> 03:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
name we don't know if it's the name the
 
03:20:41.469 --> 03:20:41.479 align:start position:0%
correct name I mean there were reports
 
03:20:43.630 --> 03:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
of 10 T of thousands of IDs on the other
 
03:20:45.150 --> 03:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
side of the border that are being left
 
03:20:47.550 --> 03:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
there uh so we still don't know who
 
03:20:49.510 --> 03:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
these people are in spite of the fact
 
03:20:50.750 --> 03:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
that they've gotten this work
 
03:20:53.469 --> 03:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
authorization so that's a way in my
 
03:20:55.030 --> 03:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
opinion of the federal government to do
 
03:20:57.469 --> 03:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
a a way around of this and this this
 
03:21:00.830 --> 03:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
would stop that well if if I could sir
 
03:21:04.990 --> 03:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
the um so Jonathan Mills from USCIS who
 
03:21:07.309 --> 03:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
I had spoken with um I don't know
 
03:21:08.630 --> 03:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
probably a year and a half ago now I've
 
03:21:11.389 --> 03:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
testified before this committee um
 
03:21:12.870 --> 03:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
during the last session about my
 
03:21:14.910 --> 03:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
conversation with him and I really tried
 
03:21:16.990 --> 03:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
to drill down on exactly what the
 
03:21:19.269 --> 03:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
process consists of I used several
 
03:21:22.349 --> 03:21:22.359 align:start position:0%
different examples um what he explained
 
03:21:25.990 --> 03:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
to me was um if you had a situation
 
03:21:28.590 --> 03:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
where somebody um came into the United
 
03:21:31.309 --> 03:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
States and they did not necessarily go
 
03:21:34.590 --> 03:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
through the proper channels to do that
 
03:21:37.830 --> 03:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
and they went to a US CIS
 
03:21:42.830 --> 03:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
office and they applied for uh Asylum
 
03:21:45.790 --> 03:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
status that the first part of that
 
03:21:48.950 --> 03:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
process through USCIS is to confirm
 
03:21:51.950 --> 03:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
identity and that he said when the
 
03:21:54.269 --> 03:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
receipt is issued that starts the clock
 
03:21:58.229 --> 03:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
ticking to work towards identity and the
 
03:22:01.189 --> 03:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
first phase of that process if you will
 
03:22:03.710 --> 03:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
is that they're able to do that if
 
03:22:05.590 --> 03:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
they're able to do that they confirm the
 
03:22:07.070 --> 03:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
identity but for the State of New
 
03:22:09.630 --> 03:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just that confirmation from
 
03:22:12.630 --> 03:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
USCIS that identity has been established
 
03:22:14.229 --> 03:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
that still doesn't change what we do
 
03:22:16.110 --> 03:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
here which is what we're talking about
 
03:22:19.830 --> 03:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
fulfillment of the entire process um to
 
03:22:22.110 --> 03:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
include in some cases an interview but
 
03:22:25.510 --> 03:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
not in every case um as I'm told and uh
 
03:22:27.189 --> 03:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
as well as a background investigation
 
03:22:28.950 --> 03:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
what the merits of that are I don't know
 
03:22:30.550 --> 03:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
I I would leave that to somebody else
 
03:22:33.870 --> 03:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
but they do establish Identity or or try
 
03:22:36.630 --> 03:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
to um at that first phase and when they
 
03:22:40.030 --> 03:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
do that does go into um that is
 
03:22:43.630 --> 03:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
marked the um one additional thing the
 
03:22:45.510 --> 03:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
work employment card isn't flagged as to
 
03:22:47.269 --> 03:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
who that's issued to so work employment
 
03:22:49.229 --> 03:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
cards are also issued as a general
 
03:22:51.630 --> 03:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
status as well as to those that have
 
03:22:53.630 --> 03:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
been here on student visas then
 
03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
transition to a work employment card so
 
03:22:57.150 --> 03:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
when we're being handed a work
 
03:22:59.070 --> 03:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
employment card we don't know whether
 
03:23:01.830 --> 03:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
they're being they're under a pending
 
03:23:04.469 --> 03:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
Asylum or not they could be here as a
 
03:23:07.870 --> 03:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
previous um student visa or just here in
 
03:23:09.910 --> 03:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
General on a work employment card we
 
03:23:11.389 --> 03:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
would have no way to determine if that
 
03:23:13.710 --> 03:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
person was pending an asylum status we
 
03:23:15.429 --> 03:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
would have to stop issuing to anyone
 
03:23:18.389 --> 03:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:20.630 --> 03:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
card I'll have to look at that again I
 
03:23:21.590 --> 03:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
don't think so because it says
 
03:23:25.030 --> 03:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding I say 263 39a but thank
 
03:23:26.750 --> 03:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
you for the information anybody else
 
03:23:29.429 --> 03:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
from the committee questions of the
 
03:23:31.950 --> 03:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
director seeing none thank you very much
 
03:23:34.429 --> 03:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr uh any other comments
 
03:23:38.189 --> 03:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
thoughts on the amendment repr you one
 
03:23:39.429 --> 03:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
of the things that we thank you Mr
 
03:23:40.630 --> 03:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
chairman one of the things we've always
 
03:23:45.030 --> 03:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
opposed uh because um aliens that are
 
03:23:46.670 --> 03:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
that are here legally that have
 
03:23:48.110 --> 03:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
fulfilled all the process and gotten a
 
03:23:51.070 --> 03:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
driver's license um a fully valid
 
03:23:53.229 --> 03:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
03:23:56.670 --> 03:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
um we don't we we tend to oppose the
 
03:23:58.950 --> 03:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
designation that they non-resident alien
 
03:24:00.870 --> 03:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
on the license because they become
 
03:24:04.670 --> 03:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
targets um they even without that alien
 
03:24:07.189 --> 03:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh Alien residents become have been
 
03:24:10.150 --> 03:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
targeted for violence discrimination by
 
03:24:11.389 --> 03:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
putting that on the card and they they
 
03:24:12.510 --> 03:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
have to go and buy cigarettes they have
 
03:24:14.469 --> 03:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
to go in buy alcohol present it at a at
 
03:24:17.070 --> 03:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
a bar it opens them up up to uh
 
03:24:19.750 --> 03:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
potential discrimination and violence so
 
03:24:21.469 --> 03:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
I would oppose it just based on that
 
03:24:22.870 --> 03:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
03:24:25.070 --> 03:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you and in response I
 
03:24:26.349 --> 03:24:26.359 align:start position:0%
thought about that as well that's why I
 
03:24:28.189 --> 03:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
left it up to the director to finds a
 
03:24:30.630 --> 03:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
suitable marking uh we've had bills in
 
03:24:32.670 --> 03:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
the past that required citizenship or
 
03:24:34.590 --> 03:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
other other things and that was the
 
03:24:36.790 --> 03:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
argument back then but this just leaves
 
03:24:38.750 --> 03:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
it up to coming up with something subtle
 
03:24:40.550 --> 03:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
and something that is just
 
03:24:43.030 --> 03:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
identifiable uh anybody else from the
 
03:24:46.349 --> 03:24:46.359 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none this is on the
 
03:24:51.269 --> 03:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:51.279 --> 03:24:56.030 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

03:24:56.030 --> 03:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:59.830 --> 03:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
06378 I'll Grant the ranking member one
 
03:25:02.790 --> 03:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
more thank you I I I just want to follow
 
03:25:04.830 --> 03:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
up on your your comment which was
 
03:25:07.510 --> 03:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
accurate and I just want to reemphasize
 
03:25:11.670 --> 03:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
it we have had in my time in the legisl
 
03:25:12.950 --> 03:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
of multiple
 
03:25:15.990 --> 03:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
bills come before the Full House to be
 
03:25:19.429 --> 03:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
voted on that would require some type of
 
03:25:22.630 --> 03:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
marking that would make a different
 
03:25:25.229 --> 03:25:25.239 align:start position:0%
class of driver's license and they have
 
03:25:28.150 --> 03:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
been roundly defeated on a strongly
 
03:25:32.189 --> 03:25:32.199 align:start position:0%
bipartisan fashion I he I hesitate and
 
03:25:35.309 --> 03:25:35.319 align:start position:0%
worry that we are now doing something
 
03:25:38.229 --> 03:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
that would contradict the history of
 
03:25:43.150 --> 03:25:43.160 align:start position:0%
this uh of the house thank you
