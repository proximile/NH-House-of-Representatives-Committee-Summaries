make we are in the general court room
 
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
here which is uh very important to our
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
state in fact the state of New Hampshire
 
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
was the first state the first place in
 
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
the United States of America to adopt a
 
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.430 align:start position:0%
the United States of America to adopt a
constitution

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
now getting into the next part some of
 
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
the rules which regarding the governor
 
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
ourselves by here
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
as you know no signs are allowed in this
 
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
chamber at all and all political pins
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
when you come up to testify anything
 
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
such as that we don't wear them here
 
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
that's just the rule we've had for years
 
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
and one which I want to go through the
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
hearing process with throughout the
 
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
other thing that we just did we just
 
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.889 align:start position:0%
other thing that we just did we just
clapped

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:02.899 align:start position:0%
clapped
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
we won't have any clapping or any of
 
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
that or yelling or Screaming or saying
 
00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
that's a great job anything like that
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
during the hearing process we have a
 
00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
number of cards up here pink cards for
 
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
those who want to testify and that is
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
going to take some time to Wade through
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
all that this this hearing will most
 
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
likely go into the afternoon hours and
 
00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:29.579 align:start position:0%
hopefully not much later than that we
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
will be taking a lunch break during the
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
middle part of the day and I will
 
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
announce that so everybody has that
 
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
awareness one of the things which we do
 
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
when we have a hearing at least we do it
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
in House Education we always provide the
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
Senators the opportunity to speak first
 
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
seeing that senators are quickly having
 
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
to go to in fact I had to testify
 
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:55.019 align:start position:0%
already this morning at nine o'clock in
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
Senate education on several bills they
 
00:12:59.810 --> 00:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
are also on many different committees so
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
we allow them to come in first the only
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
person that can supersede that is the
 
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
governor now following the centers we
 
00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
have the representatives because they
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
also have a similar type task there are
 
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:14.220 align:start position:0%
a number of Representative hearings
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
going on today house hearings across
 
00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
street and yellow B so we want them to
 
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
move on and get on their tasks when we
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
get to the general public it's my
 
00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:26.579 align:start position:0%
position that if we have parents in here
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
with children
 
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
and I know how hard it is I have a
 
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
little four and a half five-year-old
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
living with us in the house and he's
 
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
oftentimes way in front of me and I'm
 
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:37.220 align:start position:0%
chasing him
 
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
so if you have children please let us
 
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
know and we'll try to get you out of
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
here as quickly as possible
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
the hearing process itself we are going
 
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
to the another area that we do with the
 
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
hearing process in terms of House
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
Education the prime sponsor of bill has
 
00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:58.139 align:start position:0%
always given more latitude as far as
 
00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:01.139 align:start position:0%
time in which to speak they're the ones
 
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
that have gone through the process of
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
putting the bill together working with
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
various agencies Etc so they had the
 
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity to give a full speech other
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
than that we are going to enforce the
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
three-minute rule
 
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:18.839 align:start position:0%
three-minute rule will be going into
 
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
effect today every time I've had bills
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
in here when we're dealing with this
 
00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:25.019 align:start position:0%
type of issue our Charter Schools or
 
00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
similar type issues we've had to put a
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
three-minute rule into effect when we
 
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
get to 2 minutes and 45 seconds
 
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
this will come up you'll see this red
 
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
that's the warning that you have 15
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
seconds left
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
so please uh
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
go buy the rule here that's important
 
00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:47.579 align:start position:0%
that we give everybody the opportunity
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
to speak and if we don't have that rule
 
00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
we could be here close to midnight and
 
00:14:53.449 --> 00:14:53.459 align:start position:0%
there have been some evenings in session
 
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
I have been here to midnight so it won't
 
00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
be something new for me but maybe for
 
00:14:59.650 --> 00:14:59.660 align:start position:0%

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:02.760 align:start position:0%

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
District 14 comprising the towns of
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
Auburn Londonderry and Hudson and for
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
your consideration this morning I have
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 272 FN and this bill seeks
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
to establish a parent's Bill of Rights
 
00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:46.919 align:start position:0%
what what constitutes a violation of
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
such rights and a mechanism to notify
 
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
parents of their rights Mr chairman you
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
would wonder why in the world do we need
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
this bill why do we need it
 
00:17:59.210 --> 00:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
and I would ask you all to take a step
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
back a few years ago when we entered
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
into the covid epidemic
 
00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
School our schools were shut down
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
and parents ended up having the
 
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility to make sure that their
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
child was participating in their
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
education many parents became the
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
teachers for their children at home
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
and parents started to see some of the
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
things that were happening some of the
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
assignments that children their children
 
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
were being given and started raising
 
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
questions about them
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately parents for the most
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
part were shut out and ignored
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
if you were to go to a school board
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
meeting with questions
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to hear it and
 
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
oftentimes parents were not allowed to
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
speak and were not allowed to address an
 
00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:54.419 align:start position:0%
elected board
 
00:18:57.409 --> 00:18:57.419 align:start position:0%
and I ask all of you here today how
 
00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:00.299 align:start position:0%
would you feel if this bill was proposed
 
00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:03.059 align:start position:0%
and you did not have the opportunity to
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
address the legislature and give them
 
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
your opinion
 
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
so what it ended up happening was I
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
filed a bill that required that every
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
school board in the state of New
 
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and every single meeting they
 
00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:21.419 align:start position:0%
had had to allow at minimum 30 minutes
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
for parents or their constituents in
 
00:19:27.169 --> 00:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
their Community to address the board
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
that passed and is now law
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
so what we have here is also
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
um from the roots of it come from that
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it determines
 
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
what is a violation of parental rights
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
and includes a neck mechanism of
 
00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:54.059 align:start position:0%
notification for parents
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
this is not the first time we've seen
 
00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
bills like this there was one last year
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
and it died in a committee a conference
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
but it is time to to legislate this
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
issue once again
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 272 Narrows
 
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
um itself I guess you could say compared
 
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
to the bill that was filed last year and
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
it Deals Only with the parental right in
 
00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:21.169 align:start position:0%
it Deals Only with the parental right in
education

00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
scattered throughout the RSA there are
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
different parts of those rsas that deal
 
00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
with a parental rights in education and
 
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
one thing that this bill does it brings
 
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
it all into the same place
 
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
so if a parent wonders what is my right
 
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.390 align:start position:0%
so if a parent wonders what is my right
here

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
they can go to one statute and get their
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
answer and instead of having to shuffle
 
00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:44.830 align:start position:0%
answer and instead of having to shuffle
through

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
the mountains of rsas that we have
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
I want to bring up the one point here
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
that I don't really want people to
 
00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:57.500 align:start position:0%
forget that parents love their children
 
00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
they care about their children
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
and they want the best for their
 
00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.210 align:start position:0%
and they want the best for their
children

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:05.220 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
schools can't provide that to them
 
00:21:12.409 --> 00:21:12.419 align:start position:0%
schools only have your children for a
 
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
few hours a day
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
but they are home with their families
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
the majority of the time
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
and what happens with to those children
 
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
once they leave school it's the parents
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
that are going to be there with them for
 
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
the rest of their lives so why why why
 
00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
do we have to do this
 
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
well I'd like to point out to a couple
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
of things that have happened
 
00:21:45.649 --> 00:21:45.659 align:start position:0%
and I think what was most troubling to
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
me are policies that have been adopted
 
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
by school boards in this state
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
that outright lie and deceive parents
 
00:22:02.649 --> 00:22:02.659 align:start position:0%
and that is wrong that is wrong
 
00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
categorically wrong how many parents in
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
this room have talked to their kids
 
00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:12.539 align:start position:0%
about lying how lying is bad you
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
shouldn't lie
 
00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
but yet why is it okay
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
for a school to lie to parents what kind
 
00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
of lesson does that treat tell a child
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
that it's okay to lie
 
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.679 --> 00:22:35.390 align:start position:0%
 
unfortunately

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:40.039 align:start position:0%
a lot of this language revolves around
 
00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
transgendered students and I really want
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
to be very very careful here and be
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
respectful of everyone because I think
 
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
but just to give you a couple of
 
00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
examples about this
 
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
School Personnel should not disclose
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
information that may reveal the students
 
00:23:06.649 --> 00:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
transgender status or gender
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
non-conforming presentation to others
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
including parents and other school
 
00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:15.299 align:start position:0%
Personnel unless legally required to do
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
so unless the student or the parent has
 
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
authorized such disclosure
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
secondly when contacting a parent or
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
guardian of a transgender or gender
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
non-conforming student School Personnel
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
should use the student's legal name and
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
pronoun corresponding to the student's
 
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
gender assigned at Birth unless the
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
parents student parent or Guardian has
 
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
specified otherwise
 
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
those are the types of policies that
 
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
parents are very upset about and they
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
want change and quite frankly I have
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
been contacted by a number of teachers
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
around the state who don't like this
 
00:24:00.289 --> 00:24:00.299 align:start position:0%
policy they don't think it's right they
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
are parents themselves
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
and they wouldn't want someone lying to
 
00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:05.990 align:start position:0%
and they wouldn't want someone lying to
them

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
about what's happening to their children
 
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
in school
 
00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
don't forget for those of you who are
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
parents in this room and maybe even
 
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.070 align:start position:0%
parents in this room and maybe even
students

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
cannot get as much as a Tylenol if you
 
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
have a headache without your parents
 
00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.830 align:start position:0%
have a headache without your parents
permission

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
permission
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
why is this being allowed
 
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.750 align:start position:0%
why is this being allowed
why

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:24:33.529 --> 00:24:33.539 align:start position:0%
and I ask that question why
 
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:34.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
well I think what we need to what I'm
 
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
going to do here is because we're
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
talking about a legal issue because this
 
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
bill would confer a right is to look at
 
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
the legal precedence for parents
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
that have a right
 
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
to direct their children
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
a parent's right to direct educational
 
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
and religious upbringing of his or her
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
child is violated by a state that
 
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
imposes itself between a parent and
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
pertinent information about a child the
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights of parents are
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
well established by a long line of
 
00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
United States Supreme Court cases that

parent's right
 
00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:47.900 align:start position:0%
why why is a school that is basically a

government-controlled school because
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
that's what it is schools are created by
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
government and paid for with everyone's
 
00:26:58.970 --> 00:26:58.980 align:start position:0%

to usurp a parent's rights

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
a school that hides its actions toward a

child from the child's parent
 
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:20.700 align:start position:0%

right to make important decisions about
 
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
that child indeed such action deprives
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
those parents of the right to make

informed decisions about whether their
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
local public school is the right place

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
these policies and others adopted by
 
00:28:10.269 --> 00:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
schools prohibit sexual harassment
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
bullying and other in-school conduct
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
that could interfere with the child's
 
00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
right to pursue education opportunities
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
if a child is being bullied or sexually
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
harassed because of his or her gender or
 
00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:27.059 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation or for any other
 
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
reason for that matter
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
the school has a duty to take action to
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
protect the bullied child
 
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
the school will then have a duty to
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
inform the parents that the child is
 
00:28:42.409 --> 00:28:42.419 align:start position:0%
being bullied
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
this is just an example of the need for
 
00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:48.020 align:start position:0%
Action in relation to the student
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
pursuant to school policies
 
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
so if your child is being bullied
 
00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you that your child is
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
being bullied but under the other
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
policies they're not going to tell you
 
00:29:01.799 --> 00:29:03.230 align:start position:0%
policies they're not going to tell you
why

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
so how as a parent can you help your
 
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
child if you have no idea why your child
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
is being bullied
 
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
just doesn't make sense
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
the United States recently decided the
 
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
case of Bostock versus Clayton County in
 
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
2020 holding that the Title VII of the
 
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights Act of 1964
 
00:29:30.049 --> 00:29:30.059 align:start position:0%
extends its protection to transgendered
 
00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:31.490 align:start position:0%
extends its protection to transgendered
persons

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
persons
 
00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
following Bostock
 
00:29:36.289 --> 00:29:36.299 align:start position:0%
it is nearly certain that the courts
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
will find that student transgendered
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
school students are protected by Title
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
IX of the Civil Rights Act and in fact
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
that issue is currently being discussed
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
at the federal level
 
00:29:50.769 --> 00:29:50.779 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
likewise prohibits discrimination
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
against students based on their gender
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
expression and that is RSA 19327
 
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
those protections exist to protect the
 
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
rights of students in school
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
they are not rights to protect children
 
00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
from the child wearing decisions or
 
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:18.290 align:start position:0%

we've also have another case Sterling
 
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
versus borough of Minersville
 
00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
Circa 2000 this is a really sad case
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
and I really agree with the decision of
 
00:30:36.649 --> 00:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
it was a young man who was 18 years old
 
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
who was expressing his sexuality and he
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
was arrested and he was threatened he
 
00:30:48.649 --> 00:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
was threatened by the sheriff that I'm
 
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
going to tell your grandfather what you
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
were doing
 
00:30:54.409 --> 00:30:54.419 align:start position:0%
and the young man was so upset about it
 
00:30:57.169 --> 00:30:57.179 align:start position:0%
that he committed suicide
 
00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
and they and the sheriff and the state
 
00:31:03.049 --> 00:31:03.059 align:start position:0%
and the county was sued which is
 
00:31:03.059 --> 00:31:05.510 align:start position:0%
and the county was sued which is
appropriate

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
because one reason
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
as an adult he had a right to privacy
 
00:31:15.889 --> 00:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
but we're not talking about 18 year old
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
students or older because they do have a
 
00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
right to privacy
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
if they decided that they wanted to tell
 
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.970 align:start position:0%
if they decided that they wanted to tell
someone

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:25.980 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
they're 18. they're legally adults
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
and he could that he or she could say
 
00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
listen I don't want my parents to know
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
and the school would have to recognize
 
00:31:39.289 --> 00:31:39.299 align:start position:0%
that right because they are legally an
 
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
adult but we are not talking about
 
00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
adults we are talking today about minor
 
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.169 align:start position:0%
adults we are talking today about minor
children

00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman about there's a couple
 
00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
things about this bill we do realize
 
00:31:57.409 --> 00:31:57.419 align:start position:0%
that some students
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
we we recognize that
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
and what this bill does it adds in a
 
00:32:09.169 --> 00:32:09.179 align:start position:0%
layer of protections for students that
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
find themselves in that type of a home
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
which would allow the school to document
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
that this child comes from an abusive
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
home or there's a history of abuse here
 
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
and it will be kept on file
 
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
with this with the school
 
00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
to provide protection
 
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:32.590 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:34.310 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
we need to recognize that students do
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
have some privacy rights in school
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
but what is left out
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
is the involvement excuse me to involve
 
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
the right of maintaining maintaining
 
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
their privacy from school officials and
 
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
fellow students not from their parents
 
00:32:58.850 --> 00:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
and these privacy rights arise from the
 
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
family and involve the right of families
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
to maintain a degree of privacy from
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
government officials
 
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
it is the right of families to be free
 
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
from State coercion and interference
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
that is really at issue here
 
00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
it is not Educators but parents who have
 
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
primary rights in the upbringing of
 
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
their children
 
00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:28.820 align:start position:0%
school officials have only a secondary
 
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility and must respect those
 
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.909 align:start position:0%
responsibility and must respect those
rights

00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
State deference to parental control over
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
children is underscored by the Supreme
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
Court admonition that the child is not a
 
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
mere creature of the state and that it
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
is the Citizen's responsibility to
 
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
inculcate moral standards religious
 
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
beliefs and elements of good citizenship
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
it is not Educators but parents who have
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
the primary rights and the upbringing of
 
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
their children and that is a quote from
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
grunke versus seep which was a case
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
decided in 2000.
 
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
again I ask you why why are we here why
 
00:34:20.169 --> 00:34:20.179 align:start position:0%
are we ha why is this happening
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
why why is there this blanket policy
 
00:34:28.609 --> 00:34:28.619 align:start position:0%
that is being adopted in districts
 
00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:33.060 align:start position:0%
that leave parents out of this
 
00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.089 align:start position:0%
that leave parents out of this
discussion

00:34:35.089 --> 00:34:35.099 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
as I said in the beginning parents love
 
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
their children they care about their
 
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:42.839 align:start position:0%
children they want the best for their
 
00:34:42.839 --> 00:34:44.930 align:start position:0%
children they want the best for their
children

00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
we know that that's not always true
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
but why is this affecting
 
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
parents who want to be involved in their
 
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
children's lives
 
00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
who want to be there to help their
 
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
children no matter what they're going
 
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
through to be there for them and get
 
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
them the appropriate care because the
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
school can't authorize that care
 
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
it's only the parents
 
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
so I ask you what how does this work
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
you're asking students to live a double
 
00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.010 align:start position:0%
you're asking students to live a double
life

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
one life at home being one person and at
 
00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:29.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
and as a parent I can tell you that
 
00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
there's nothing worse than getting a
 
00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
phone call from a school
 
00:35:40.609 --> 00:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
on a Friday at 3 30 in the afternoon
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
with them telling you
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
that your child was sexually assaulted
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
and it's now three weeks later
 
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:56.220 align:start position:0%
why wasn't I told was the question that
 
00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
I asked
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
and I was told well we don't have to
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
tell you this is a courtesy call
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
that is what happened to my family
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
it was well over 20 years ago but it's
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
what happened to my family
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
and it's wrong my daughter thought she
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
did the right thing by telling the
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
so she felt she didn't need to say
 
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:28.980 align:start position:0%
anything to us
 
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
and I didn't give her a hard time
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
because she did the right thing but as a
 
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
parent I had the right to know what
 
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:41.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
it wasn't the school's responsibility
 
00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
the first call should have been to my
 
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.290 align:start position:0%
the first call should have been to my
family

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't made
 
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
and I don't want any other parent to
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
have to go through this
 
00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
it's really and truly unfortunate
 
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
parents voices ask to be heard they want
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
to be heard and this bill will allow
 
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.109 align:start position:0%
to be heard and this bill will allow
that

00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
it really and truly is thank you Mr
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%

thank you chairman Ladd and thank you

for taking a few minutes to listen to me
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
I am here today to speak in support of
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 272. the parental Bill of
 
00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:23.099 align:start position:0%
Rights as a father
 
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
I understand the importance of
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
protecting parental rights and ensuring
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
that parents have the information they
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
need to make informed decisions about
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
their children's education
 
00:38:38.329 --> 00:38:38.339 align:start position:0%
and as the former Senate President I
 
00:38:41.089 --> 00:38:41.099 align:start position:0%
know just how important this legislation
 
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
is to so many Granite State parents and
 
00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.530 align:start position:0%
is to so many Granite State parents and
families

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
I thank Senator Carson for all the work
 
00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
she's done on this legislation
 
00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
at its core Senate Bill 272 is about
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
enshrining a parent's right to know what
 
00:38:59.690 --> 00:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
their child is being taught in the
 
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
school in the conversations our children
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
and grandchildren are having with their
 
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.990 align:start position:0%
and grandchildren are having with their
teachers

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
this may seem like a simple concept
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
but it is one that is often overlooked
 
00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
in our education system
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
parents should have access to
 
00:39:17.569 --> 00:39:17.579 align:start position:0%
information about their child's
 
00:39:20.329 --> 00:39:20.339 align:start position:0%
curriculum as well as materials or
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
resources that are being used in the
 
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.630 align:start position:0%
resources that are being used in the
classroom

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
this knowledge is essential to ensure
 
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
that parents can make informed decisions
 
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
about their child's education and can
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
provide the necessary support at home
 
00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
in addition Senate Bill 272 also
 
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
protects a parent's right to up their
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
child out of certain activities or
 
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
materials they may find objectionable
 
00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
this is a fundamental right that parents
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
should have it is one that has been
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
upheld by the courts by enshrining this
 
00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
right in law
 
00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
we have provided parents with the
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
insurance that their wishes will be
 
00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
respected and that they will have to say
 
00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
in their child's education
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
ultimately Senate Bill 272 is empowering
 
00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
parents and ensuring that they have the
 
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
center of their child's education as a
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
parent myself I know firsthand
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
how important it was to be involved in
 
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
my child's Learning and Development
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
and I want her rights protected when it
 
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
comes to the Future family and my future
 
00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.370 align:start position:0%
comes to the Future family and my future
grandchildren

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
grandchildren
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
by enshrining a parental Bill of Rights
 
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
and law we are sending a clear message
 
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
that parents of valued Partners in the
 
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
education process and that their input
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
and participation are essential to the
 
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
accessibility success of our schools and
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
our children
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
I urge you to support Senate Bill 272
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
and to send a strong message to parents
 
00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:02.099 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire that their rights
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
are valued and protected thank you Mr
 
00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you very much Senator
 
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%

on behalf of the parents of my district
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
the parents in the state of New
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and as a proud parent myself
 
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
I'm asking the members of the community
 
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
to please keep an open mind
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
and focus on the bill that's in front of
 
00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.150 align:start position:0%
and focus on the bill that's in front of
you

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
and on both sides we're hearing a lot of
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
political rhetoric but I will ask to
 
00:42:01.849 --> 00:42:01.859 align:start position:0%
focus on the bill that's before this
 
00:42:04.609 --> 00:42:04.619 align:start position:0%
committee in its simplest form what does
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
what it does in its simplest form it
 
00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.670 align:start position:0%
what it does in its simplest form it
forbids

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
forbids
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
the educational institution the schools
 
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
the School Employees the teachers which
 
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
who are government actors
 
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.589 align:start position:0%
who are government actors
from

00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
lying to parents who inquire with the
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
school about issues involving their
 
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:26.220 align:start position:0%
children that's all this bill does
 
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
is to promote honesty
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm asking everyone to think
 
00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:34.140 align:start position:0%
in their mind about a plausible scenario
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
where a parent would inquire with a
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
school about their child's sexuality or
 
00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:41.339 align:start position:0%
gender identity
 
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
and and those in that plausible scenario
 
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
you will have a parent who perhaps
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
suspects something about their child
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it is more harmful for the
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
school to lie to the parents
 
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
because that's going to confuse the
 
00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.250 align:start position:0%
because that's going to confuse the
parents

00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
and that can be harmful to the child who
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps is trying to express themselves
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
to their parents in subtle ways and
 
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
trying to get that message across but by
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
lying to the parent
 
00:43:11.329 --> 00:43:11.339 align:start position:0%
in Mis in misdirecting them you can you
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
see where there's now a disconnection
 
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
between the parent and their children
 
00:43:16.849 --> 00:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
caused by the school the school made the
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
problem worse not better by lying and
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
that's my my opinion
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
I ask that we keep an open mind
 
00:43:26.329 --> 00:43:26.339 align:start position:0%
I'm a millennial and growing up I recall
 
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
that the schools always encouraged
 
00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.690 align:start position:0%
that the schools always encouraged
parents

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
to work with the schools and to be
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
involved in their children's education
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure when that changed
 
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
but that was not broke
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure why we think now it's
 
00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:43.980 align:start position:0%
all right to now mislead parents if it
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
comes to any other activity in the
 
00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.030 align:start position:0%
comes to any other activity in the
school

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
football wrestling whatever Sports track
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
and field
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
parents have always been involved
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
there's permission slips to go on fail
 
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
trips that's how the school's always
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
been I support that policy I certainly
 
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
don't support the school misleading
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
parents and lying to parents that's
 
00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:05.339 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and I asked this committee
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
please support and ought to pass thank

and as someone who has served our
 
00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:51.420 align:start position:0%

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
before us we have a bill in Senate Bill
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
272 which I believe should not even have
 
00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
to be legislated
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
the foundation of every nation
 
00:45:10.329 --> 00:45:10.339 align:start position:0%
is the family
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
and anything that jeopardizes or
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
threatens the family becomes a threat
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately to the survival of the
 
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.770 align:start position:0%
ultimately to the survival of the
society

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
society
 
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
current law enables a teacher to
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
withhold information about the most
 
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.890 align:start position:0%
withhold information about the most
intimate

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
intimate
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
and difficult aspects of a child's
 
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.910 align:start position:0%
and difficult aspects of a child's
development

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
development
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
from those who were entrusted by God and
 
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
nature to rear that child
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
our Declaration of Independence speaks
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
to the laws of God and of Nature's God
 
00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry nature and of nature is God
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
and we as men and women
 
00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
amplify those with the laws of men
 
00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:50.540 align:start position:0%
but when those laws begin to transgress
 
00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
the laws of nature and of Nature's God
 
00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
the rights and obligations of Parenthood
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
over children will you enable state
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
agencies okay without justification to
 
00:46:11.089 --> 00:46:11.099 align:start position:0%
interfere with that process of parenting
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
without justification we are beginning
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
to sow the seeds of the decline
 
00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
of our society those children belong to
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
the parents not to the school
 
00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
there is no reason on God's Earth that
 
00:46:27.609 --> 00:46:27.619 align:start position:0%
absent the compelling State
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
causes that are Exempted in this bill
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
a parent should not be told of things
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
about their child that are those most
 
00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
intimate items that a teacher might
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
become aware of
 
00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
teacher's job is done at three o'clock
 
00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon a parent's job is never

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
has been testified
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
on all the parental rights I'm a member
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
of the house I'm a representative for
 
00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:58.550 align:start position:0%
of the house I'm a representative for
Rochester

00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
Rochester
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
so I've already testified on the house
 
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
bill version of the parental rights has
 
00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:07.619 align:start position:0%
all been based on a premise of abusive
 
00:48:07.619 --> 00:48:08.990 align:start position:0%
all been based on a premise of abusive
parents

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
where is due process
 
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
why have we forgotten there is due
 
00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
process in this country
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
why have we forgotten about all of the
 
00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:20.940 align:start position:0%
laws that are already protecting
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
children from abusive parents
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
I want to be clear about all of the
 
00:48:29.569 --> 00:48:29.579 align:start position:0%
testimony that has been given which
 
00:48:32.089 --> 00:48:32.099 align:start position:0%
there's tons and it's been over the last
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
two years
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
these are not new granted rights
 
00:48:41.569 --> 00:48:41.579 align:start position:0%
these are the rights that we as parents
 
00:48:44.569 --> 00:48:44.579 align:start position:0%
already possess
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
they are granted and rooted and are
 
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
god-given natural rights and by our
 
00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
founding fathers in the laws of the land
 
00:48:55.089 --> 00:48:55.099 align:start position:0%
our state and federal constitutions
 
00:48:55.099 --> 00:48:56.990 align:start position:0%
our state and federal constitutions
unfortunately

00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:48:59.089 --> 00:48:59.099 align:start position:0%
based upon so many things that have
 
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
happened over the last three years we
 
00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
are forced to spell out these rights in
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
00:49:08.089 --> 00:49:08.099 align:start position:0%
because government entities have forced
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
parents into this position
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
there are numerous court cases as you've
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
already heard that solidify parents
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
rights as well there's a couple that
 
00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:25.140 align:start position:0%
Cleveland versus Board of Education in
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
lafer and this was in 1974. this court
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
has long recognized that freedom of
 
00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
personal choice in matters of marriage
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
and family life is one of the Liberties
 
00:49:38.569 --> 00:49:38.579 align:start position:0%
protected by the due process clause of
 
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
the 14th Amendment
 
00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
the 14th Amendment forbids the
 
00:49:44.829 --> 00:49:44.839 align:start position:0%
government to infringe
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
fundamental Liberty interests of all no
 
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
matter what process is provided unless
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
the infringement is narrowly tailored to
 
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
serving a compelling State interest and
 
00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
that's the protections that we have in
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
place for children that are vulnerable
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
that's the compelling State interest our
 
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
laws protect those kids
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
in a long line of cases the courts have
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
held that in addition to the specific
 
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights
 
00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
the Liberty that specifically protected
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
by the due process clause includes the
 
00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
rights to direct the education in the
 
00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
upbringing of one's children
 
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
I strongly support this Bill thank you
 
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you very much
 
00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.010 align:start position:0%

I'm representative Peter Petrino from
 
00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 23 the town of Milford
 
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
you have heard testimony and you'll hear
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
more testimony that parental rights
 
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
already exist in numerous federal and
 
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
state statutes
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire child advocate
 
00:51:08.809 --> 00:51:08.819 align:start position:0%
testified that this bill would put some
 
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
children In Harm's Way
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
especially those
 
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
who are members of the lgbtq community
 
00:51:20.329 --> 00:51:20.339 align:start position:0%
and that even the governors one trusted
 
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
adult program
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
would be compromised
 
00:51:26.809 --> 00:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
but none of this is swayed some to
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
realize how wrong this bill is
 
00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
now I will admit that I have read
 
00:51:35.569 --> 00:51:35.579 align:start position:0%
in heard of instances that would lead
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
some to believe that this bill is
 
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.569 align:start position:0%
some to believe that this bill is
necessary

00:51:38.569 --> 00:51:38.579 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:51:41.569 --> 00:51:41.579 align:start position:0%
and I'll even concede that there have
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
been instances in which parental rights
 
00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
have been violated
 
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
but the fact of the matter is
 
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
that schools can't even give a child a
 
00:51:56.089 --> 00:51:56.099 align:start position:0%
baby aspirin without parental consent
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
in every profession there are instances
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
of misconduct in every profession
 
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
when parental rights are violated those
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
responsible must be held accountable
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
and parents already have the right to
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
file complaints
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
initiate inquiries
 
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
and file lawsuits and believe me they
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
file lawsuits
 
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
my concern with this bill specifically
 
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
is with the provisions
 
00:52:30.589 --> 00:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
which Begin by stating
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
the right to inquire of the school or
 
00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
School personnel and to be truthfully
 
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
and completely informed that's when my
 
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:41.460 align:start position:0%
objection lies
 
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
it's understood that teachers answer
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
questions related to a child's academic
 
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
progress School conduct and anything
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
else applicable along those lines but
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
as a matter of professional judgment
 
00:52:58.730 --> 00:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
and good conscience
 
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
teachers may be hesitant and they may
 
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
even refuse to answer
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
instead a teacher may decide that it's
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
best for parents to inquire of the
 
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
principle the guidance counselor
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
school nurse other professionals with
 
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
certain expertise
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
more so
 
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
a teacher May at times believe that
 
00:53:22.849 --> 00:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
revealing certain information to
 
00:53:25.309 --> 00:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
particular parents may put a Child In
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
Harm's Way every situation is unique
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
and again should parents believe that
 
00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
their rights have been violated
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
they already have proper recourse
 
00:53:41.089 --> 00:53:41.099 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is this
 
00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
no one
 
00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
has the right to compel someone else to
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
do anything against their will
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
in this case forcing teachers to answer
 
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
questions that they may feel is
 
00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:53.930 align:start position:0%
questions that they may feel is
inappropriate

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
or harmful
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
if it is revealed
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
and when confronted with the possibility
 
00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
of losing their employment and civil and
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
criminal liability
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
I excuse me Mr chairman I believe that
 
00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:13.140 align:start position:0%
you said that senators and
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
representatives no no I said the prime
 
00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
sponsor may have longer senators and
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
representatives have the same
 
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my name is Bob Lin
 
00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
I'm a state representative from Windham
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
and I am here to speak in strong support
 
00:54:50.329 --> 00:54:50.339 align:start position:0%
of SB 272
 
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
um a candidly and with respect to the
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
prior speaker I have to say that his
 
00:54:58.609 --> 00:54:58.619 align:start position:0%
comments simply reinforce in my mind the
 
00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
importance and the need for this bill
 
00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:06.020 align:start position:0%
um it is it strikes me as just
 
00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
incomprehensible that you have you can
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
have a circumstance where a child
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
goes to a teacher to reveal some
 
00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:18.829 align:start position:0%
goes to a teacher to reveal some
information

00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:55:21.049 --> 00:55:21.059 align:start position:0%
um that's that that is exactly the
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
situation that we're talking about a
 
00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
child goes to a teacher to reveal some
 
00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.470 align:start position:0%
child goes to a teacher to reveal some
information

00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
um that perhaps they wouldn't reveal to
 
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
to to uh a stranger or to some to
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
somebody outside the school context and
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
that it's somehow should be all right
 
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
for the teacher to say I'm not going to
 
00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
tell the parents that information now as
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson pointed out there is
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
there obviously needs to be an exception
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
to that circumstance where there is a
 
00:55:56.089 --> 00:55:56.099 align:start position:0%
real concern
 
00:55:59.690 --> 00:55:59.700 align:start position:0%
that that this if the school reveals the
 
00:56:02.089 --> 00:56:02.099 align:start position:0%
information there's some harm could come
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
to the child I think those situations
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
are very very very rare but but I have
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
to concede that they probably do exist
 
00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
and in those situations there should be
 
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
an exception so that the school is is uh
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
it does not have to reveal in in those
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
situations and in fact the bill contains
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
that language uh to allow the school not
 
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
to make disclosures in those rare
 
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
situations but I submit to you ladies
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
and gentlemen and Mr chair that what
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
that the real circumstance here I think
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
in the vast majority of cases
 
00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:43.380 align:start position:0%
is that a teacher or the school system
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
believes that
 
00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:50.339 align:start position:0%
it's okay to protect a child from having
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
to have not not from being victimized or
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
from Violence by the parents or
 
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
something like that but that it's okay
 
00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
to protect the child from having to have
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
what may be an uncomfortable
 
00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:05.339 align:start position:0%
conversation with their parents and I
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
submit respectfully that that's just not
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
the school's responsibility having
 
00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
difficult conversations with your
 
00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:15.900 align:start position:0%
parents is what we call life we all had
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
to have that during our lives and there
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
should be no legal reason why this why
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
we would allow a state or our schools
 
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
schools to be Exempted uh to to allow
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
students to be Exempted from that aspect
 
00:57:32.809 --> 00:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
of life so I'm a strong supporter of the
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
bill I would just add very briefly that
 
00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
um and I I that the there is a the
 
00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
section of the current bill that defines
 
00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest I think it is
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
it is worded incorrectly and I've spoken
 
00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:53.220 align:start position:0%
to representative cordelli about this
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
um and I would uh I would suggest that
 
00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
it needs to be changed and I have some
 
00:57:59.930 --> 00:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
suggested language thank you Mr speaker
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much judge any questions
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairs I'm
 
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
president Timothy Horrigan come from
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
Stratford County District 10 which is
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
the town of Durham and uh I think I
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
created a little bit of confusion
 
00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
because I pressed the wrong radio button
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
on the website but I am in fact opposed
 
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
to this bill but as you see it's my
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
written testimony hopefully if I get far
 
00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
enough into it my oral testimony I I do
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
acknowledge parents have rights and this
 
00:58:43.609 --> 00:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
is something actually could be used as a
 
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle for certain things which I doubt
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
the Senator's responsive would be very
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic about but anyway and I'll
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
skip to the end of my written testimony
 
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
just very very quickly is that this does
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
include charter schools which a lot of
 
00:58:59.089 --> 00:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
bills about public education don't but
 
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:00.839 align:start position:0%
it still doesn't cover the whole
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
universe of uh publicly funded and
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
subsidized education it says nothing
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
about the public Academy such as
 
00:59:11.569 --> 00:59:11.579 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton or Rivendell in a
 
00:59:13.609 --> 00:59:13.619 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about education
 
00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
providers some of which are private
 
00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:16.380 align:start position:0%
schools some which are the type of
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
entities who are being subsidized
 
00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
through the uh
 
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account vouchers and
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
the other business tax credit thing and
 
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
certainly if we don't want public funds
 
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:26.700 align:start position:0%
being used for certain things in a
 
00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:27.900 align:start position:0%
public school we probably don't want
 
00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:29.220 align:start position:0%
them used for certain things and other
 
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
types of providers
 
00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:35.700 align:start position:0%
and anyway also it would it would impose
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
significant new costs on public schools
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
so as such as an underfunded mandate so
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
I should think that should be enough for
 
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
21 20 to nothing Ito vote right there
 
00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
that should be the end of the story for
 
00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
a lot of people on the committee but
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
sadly I don't think it is and um just
 
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
very quickly say that I definitely
 
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
believe this is primarily directed
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
against LGBT trans kids and lbgt kids in
 
01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
uh in general even though we're kind of
 
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
the proponents are kind of dancing
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
around that issue and um
 
01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
so of course parents have rights but so
 
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
many children so many of the so-called
 
01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
rights ostensibly guaranteed by SB 272
 
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
where right so parents simply don't have
 
01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:15.650 align:start position:0%
where right so parents simply don't have
children

01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
even minors are people in their own
 
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:20.220 align:start position:0%
rights and they do have rights separate
 
01:00:21.289 --> 01:00:21.299 align:start position:0%
from those of the parents and the
 
01:00:22.609 --> 01:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
parents don't have the right to tell
 
01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
their children how to think
 
01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.490 align:start position:0%
their children how to think
um

01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
well at least they can don't know the
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
right to tell the children what to think
 
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
um children have the right to think for
 
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
themselves no parent has the right to
 
01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
tell an LGBT child not to be LGBT even
 
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
if such a thing was was possible and uh
 
01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
just in general children have the right
 
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
to be who they are even their parents
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't approve and even non-lg even you
 
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
know CIS male heterosexual kids like me
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
um you know struggle a lot with their
 
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
identity in their teenage years and
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
their parents can't do everything for
 
01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:55.190 align:start position:0%
their parents can't do everything for
them

01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
and I'll also go back again once again
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
it's an unfunded mandate and once again
 
01:01:00.359 --> 01:01:01.670 align:start position:0%
it's an unfunded mandate and once again
I

01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
I would be amazed if uh
 
01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note the education committee
 
01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
during education did not bother to fill
 
01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
out a fiscal note so uh
 
01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
we had just asking this it's a totally
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate and that really as I
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
said should be enough reason for 20 to
 
01:01:18.289 --> 01:01:18.299 align:start position:0%
nothing itl however
 
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
we'll say there are things this could be
 
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
used as a vehicle for certain things
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
like well school funding possibly uh
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
updating curriculum standards or even
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
school safety such as we could use this
 
01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
for a federal gun safety bill I don't
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
really anticipate that happening but
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
those would be Germaine amendments and
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
things you might consider so thanks
 
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative questions from
 
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
if you have written testimony yes oh yes
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald
 
01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:47.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for your
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
testimony in addition to everyone else
 
01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
who's going to testify Yeah you
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned a financial burden yeah could
 
01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
you just clarify for the committee where
 
01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
the financial costs would be accrued for
 
01:01:59.809 --> 01:01:59.819 align:start position:0%
informing parents which could prevent
 
01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
costs from future lawsuits are not
 
01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
informed so where is this cost that
 
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
you're talking about an unfunded mandate
 
01:02:07.609 --> 01:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
I would say
 
01:02:10.849 --> 01:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
well there's huge costs um it uh it's
 
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
going to uh it's going to create a lot
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
of cases where teachers are allowed to
 
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:17.460 align:start position:0%
tell things before they you know there's
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot more things that
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
schools have to track particularly the
 
01:02:22.609 --> 01:02:22.619 align:start position:0%
part about one specific thing is the
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
part about clubs and student
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
associations which they currently aren't
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
required to track every Club association
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
or also attracting tracking what names
 
01:02:35.089 --> 01:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
people are being called or even what
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
gender and also by the way this will
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
like make illegal a common form of at
 
01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
least bullying that uh you know certain
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
CIS males students feel if they feel
 
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
like a
 
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
one of their male colleagues is not
 
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
sufficiently heteronormative you know
 
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
not sufficiently heterosexual they'll
 
01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
often like call them A variation the
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
female variation of their name and call
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
the boy she and um
 
01:02:59.690 --> 01:02:59.700 align:start position:0%
now schools are going to be required to
 
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
report that even though that's an
 
01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
age-old form of bullying and you're
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
going to get some CIS male kids who
 
01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
have appointed themselves you know
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
guardians of heterosexual Norms they're
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
now going to get in trouble which is not
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
entirely a bad thing in my opinion but
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
that does mean the schools will be
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
reporting a lot of behavior and dealing
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
with it that probably mostly now they
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
probably like chalk up the boys being
 
01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
boys so you're going to get some uh
 
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
you're going to get like and you're
 
01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
certainly going to get some CIS male
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
students are just overly enthusiastic
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
about their CIS male status and trouble
 
01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:31.740 align:start position:0%
just because they're harassing uh
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
their their colleagues who they think
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
don't fit their standards of a of gender
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
identity but yeah so there's a lot of
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
costs and there's the education
 
01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
committee refused to fill out the fiscal
 
01:03:43.849 --> 01:03:43.859 align:start position:0%
notes I think that's not just one of
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
many reasons to be very suspicious of
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
this bill so nice I appreciate that
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
the list those concerns so I do
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate you saying that but I do not
 
01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
see where a cost is associated with the
 
01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
points you mentioned but thank you yeah
 
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
that's not my main reason the fiscal
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
impact but we do hear this committee
 
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
often turns things down even things with
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
really minimal or no cost because it's a
 
01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
unfunded Monday we've had things that
 
01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
are unfunded mandates that are like
 
01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
versus not even a rounding error in
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
terms of the budget so thanks thank you
 
01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
very much representative representative
 
01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:16.250 align:start position:0%
very much representative representative
Guthrie

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
Guthrie
 
01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:20.299 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and fellow colleagues
 
01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
when I first read this bill I was
 
01:04:27.289 --> 01:04:27.299 align:start position:0%
surprised that the number of rights that
 
01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
parents already have I think even the
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor indicated all the irsks
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
that are already on the books so
 
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
I thought when I came here that my
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
opinion was going to be different than
 
01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:45.020 align:start position:0%
everybody else but I think it's even
 
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
some of the information
 
01:04:52.690 --> 01:04:52.700 align:start position:0%
is coming from the sponsors but
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
and I Mr chairman I be remiss if I
 
01:04:58.849 --> 01:04:58.859 align:start position:0%
didn't say how good it is to see
 
01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
democracy in action I wish we could have
 
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
this many people in the house we have a
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
regular session so I thank you for all
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
those who are coming on both sides so in
 
01:05:12.049 --> 01:05:12.059 align:start position:0%
interest in that time I'm just going to
 
01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:15.059 align:start position:0%
read my statement and leave it at that
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
and ask the committee to consider all
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
the facts and what is really in this
 
01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:25.460 align:start position:0%
bill in their deliberations so I say
 
01:05:29.329 --> 01:05:29.339 align:start position:0%
uh as I said before I'm Joe Guthrie uh
 
01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
State Rep from Hampstead and I'm very
 
01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
pleased to be here and I'm in favor of
 
01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
both parental rights and
 
01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but I oppose Senate
 
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
bill 272. I don't think there's a person
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
in this room this opposes parents rights
 
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to oppose marriage
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
rights my feeling is you already have
 
01:05:54.599 --> 01:05:56.510 align:start position:0%
rights my feeling is you already have
them

01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:05:58.609 --> 01:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that parents already
 
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
have the rights referred to in this bill
 
01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
and that the bill is unnecessary this
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
bill is a mirror image of House Bill 10
 
01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:09.059 align:start position:0%
which was heard by the children and
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
family laws committee and table by the
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
full House why was why should we
 
01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:17.700 align:start position:0%
consider a second bill
 
01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
this bill as written lists the right
 
01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
parents already have there are more than
 
01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
20 rsas referred to in this bill that
 
01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
lists current rights and
 
01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
responsibilities I am sure when parents
 
01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
are involved in the PTA take an interest
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
in their school committee and through
 
01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
teacher conference they are aware of
 
01:06:45.289 --> 01:06:45.299 align:start position:0%
what's going on over there boys and
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
they already know whether or not their
 
01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:53.700 align:start position:0%
boy or girl is failing to thrive they
 
01:06:56.569 --> 01:06:56.579 align:start position:0%
don't need additional help from us if
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
there is a problem the prison rsas give
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
any help necessary I hope this committee
 
01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
can agree that this bill could have a
 
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
weakening effect on a school systems in
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire public education is
 
01:07:13.609 --> 01:07:13.619 align:start position:0%
threatened and has put Educators under
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
great strain
 
01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 272 reinforces that
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
perception we will be better soon
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
without action that divide us if we have
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
problems in any of our schools in any of
 
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
our cities and towns let's ask
 
01:07:32.329 --> 01:07:32.339 align:start position:0%
what can we do to help
 
01:07:34.609 --> 01:07:34.619 align:start position:0%
please reject this unnecessary Bill
 
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you very much

Elementary for 20 years and I was in

education for 40 years
 
01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
what unites us here is again our concern
 
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
about children their upbringing in the
 
01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:12.059 align:start position:0%
rights of parents
 
01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
that isn't already
 
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
in practice or should be in practice in
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
good Public Schools
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
but I ask you why do we have a bill that
 
01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
is divisive this bill is a wolf in
 
01:08:30.829 --> 01:08:30.839 align:start position:0%
sheep's clothing there is so much good
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
that's written in this bill
 
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
but there's so much bad that can happen
 
01:08:39.169 --> 01:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
now listen to the sponsor of the of this
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
bill who mentioned this the person who
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
was 18 who committed suicide when the
 
01:08:49.249 --> 01:08:49.259 align:start position:0%
disclosure of his sexual identity
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
was about to be revealed or was
 
01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.370 align:start position:0%
was about to be revealed or was
threatened

01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
threatened
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
push that back six months to that
 
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
student is 17.
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
in six months
 
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
there was nothing that that speaker said
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
that would have protected that child a
 
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
school would have been would have been
 
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
required to disclose the same
 
01:09:11.329 --> 01:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
information so what do you think would
 
01:09:14.809 --> 01:09:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
we have a youth suicide problem do we
 
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
really want to
 
01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.329 --> 01:09:26.339 align:start position:0%
like I said we are united
 
01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
in our concerned about the raising of
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
kids this bill devises
 
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
it is divisive and it should not be
 
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
passed thank you thank you very much
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%

representative selig
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
committee representative J.R Hull

serving the towns of Dunbarton Hooksett
 
01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
Allenstown and epsom
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to read the first section of
 
01:10:00.169 --> 01:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
the bill pass the definitions
 
01:10:02.209 --> 01:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
all parental rights are reserved to the
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
parents of minor children in the state
 
01:10:05.689 --> 01:10:05.699 align:start position:0%
without obstruction or interference from
 
01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
any school or School personnel
 
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is a bill that
 
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
Fosters trust between parents and the
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
education system once information is
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
being withheld that then pollutes that
 
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
relationship that damages the
 
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
relationship between the parents and the
 
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
school system that Foster the current
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
system Fosters distrust by allowing this
 
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
bill to be passed into law we would have
 
01:10:31.010 --> 01:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
greater trust between the parents and
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
and the school there should be nothing
 
01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
to hide there should be no secrets last
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
year a very similar bill was put forward
 
01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
and at the time of the committee of
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
conference there was a petition
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
circulated around I'm going to turn this
 
01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
in his written testimony
 
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:45.780 align:start position:0%
over 1200 people signed that petition in
 
01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
support of the bill that year which was
 
01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
HB 1431 that was being supported by
 
01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
reopen New Hampshire
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
I would ask that you would support this
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill as a co-founder of that
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
organization because it is important
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
that parents have a greater
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
understanding of what is going in the
 
01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
school system thank you thank you
 
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:03.960 align:start position:0%

committee

01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.010 --> 01:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
welcome back
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Ladd and members of
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
the edu House Education committee
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking today in favor in support
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
of Senate bill 272.
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
I believe it's a sad State of Affairs in
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
our state and quite frankly throughout
 
01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
the country that it's come to this that
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
we need to have a bill like this but we
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's this bill quite simply is a common
 
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:42.780 align:start position:0%
sense bill that will ensure that parents
 
01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
rights are upheld
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
and that parents
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
be involved with their children's
 
01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.290 align:start position:0%
be involved with their children's
education

01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
one of the proudest days I had in my
 
01:11:59.450 --> 01:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
life and the happiest day was when my
 
01:12:01.729 --> 01:12:01.739 align:start position:0%
two kids were born
 
01:12:03.649 --> 01:12:03.659 align:start position:0%
I was there for both of their births it
 
01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
was a miracle and quite frankly I
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
recognize and realize as a parent that I
 
01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
have a tremendous amount of
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility and I shouldn't have to
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
and parents shouldn't have to give that
 
01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
that uh responsibility away to the to
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
the government
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
we already have in law a mechanism for
 
01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
parents where there's abusive situation
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
and where there's a problem in a family
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
to address that
 
01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
and so I don't believe this will
 
01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
interfere with that in any way
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
I as a ski coach I spent 13 years
 
01:12:42.649 --> 01:12:42.659 align:start position:0%
coaching Timberland Varsity ski team
 
01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
I saw student athletes on a regular
 
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
basis make bad decisions because when
 
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
you're young you do that sort of thing
 
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly many of them that I
 
01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
saw go down a particular road is
 
01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.390 align:start position:0%
saw go down a particular road is
students

01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:12:58.970 --> 01:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
once they became adults they they
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
changed their mind and and uh
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
and looked at things differently there's
 
01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
a reason why you have to be a certain
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
age or drive a car there's a reason why
 
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
you have to be a certain age to smoke
 
01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and to vote so
 
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
I stand Here wholeheartedly uh
 
01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:20.219 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill and say that a
 
01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
parent's rights should always Trump a
 
01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
school administrative officials rights
 
01:13:27.130 --> 01:13:27.140 align:start position:0%
unless there is a cause or a reason
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
again with his abuse so I want to thank
 
01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
you for listening and on behalf of New
 
01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire parents please
 
01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
pass Senate Bill 272. thank you thank
 
01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:39.179 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative seleg
 
01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
reps honorable John Johnson Don Dodge
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
Johnson and representative Pat long in
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
that order
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
education committee although I'm now a
 
01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
state representative I used to be a
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
middle school and high school English
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
teacher been out of the classroom for a
 
01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
while now and though he heard that my
 
01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
job was done at 3 pm every day some of
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
my former students have just turned 40.
 
01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
they're still in touch with me and they
 
01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
continue to ask me for advice when they
 
01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
need it
 
01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
when I was a teacher I worked hard to
 
01:14:12.169 --> 01:14:12.179 align:start position:0%
Foster relationships with my students so
 
01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
they would feel safe and comfortable
 
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
talking with me about their problems
 
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes it was difficult to navigate
 
01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
the situation with another teacher
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes it was because they'd had an
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
argument with their parents and needed a
 
01:14:24.649 --> 01:14:24.659 align:start position:0%
safe space to vent so they could go back
 
01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
and work through the issue
 
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
and occasionally it was to talk about
 
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
relationship issues they knew their
 
01:14:31.490 --> 01:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
parents would not be comfortable with
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
in fact one of my specific
 
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as an advisor was to
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
create the type of safe space where
 
01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
students could come talk to me to get
 
01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
advice and guidance on how to navigate
 
01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
challenging aspects of their lives
 
01:14:45.649 --> 01:14:45.659 align:start position:0%
it was crucial I keep their confidence
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
because while they figured out these
 
01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.350 align:start position:0%
because while they figured out these
issues

01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:14:49.729 --> 01:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
there were some occasions where kids
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
came to talk to me because they either
 
01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
knew or suspected they were lesbian or
 
01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
gay and wanted to figure out how to talk
 
01:14:57.169 --> 01:14:57.179 align:start position:0%
to their parents about it they might
 
01:14:59.330 --> 01:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
discuss their depression or maybe their
 
01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
worries about their parents health
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
we would go through simple conversation
 
01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
sample conversations and rehearse what
 
01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
they were going to say
 
01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
with me taking on different roles about
 
01:15:10.970 --> 01:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
how their parents might react and
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
figuring out how to navigate it
 
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
in other cases kids might talk to me
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
about how to end a relationship with a
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
current partner in a way that wouldn't
 
01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:20.460 align:start position:0%
be hurtful
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
if I hadn't had the ability to maintain
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
their privacy and their confidentiality
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
these kids would not have had a safe
 
01:15:25.679 --> 01:15:26.870 align:start position:0%
these kids would not have had a safe
Outlet

01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
Outlet
 
01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
I now have two teenagers of my own I'm
 
01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
very grateful to the other adults that
 
01:15:33.649 --> 01:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
make up their Village these are teachers
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
parents of other children long time
 
01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:39.179 align:start position:0%
family friends and others in general my
 
01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
children do feel safe coming to talk
 
01:15:42.649 --> 01:15:42.659 align:start position:0%
with me about pretty much everything
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
but they're also adolescents who have
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
times when they need to talk things
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
through before they talk with me or
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
their dad
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
because they have these other adults in
 
01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
their life they know they can get the
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
support to navigate whatever life throws
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
at them
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
but finally I want to close with the
 
01:15:59.209 --> 01:15:59.219 align:start position:0%
story from my own Community from five
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
we had a young man with an incredibly
 
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
promising future he was raised in a very
 
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
tight-knit religious family
 
01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:10.140 align:start position:0%
he tried to come out to his family
 
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
he was seeking his parents love
 
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
that was denied
 
01:16:16.610 --> 01:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
in his desperation and grief he took his
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
family's Minivan and drove at very high
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
speed into a barricade on I-95
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
it broke our community
 
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
teachers aren't trying to hide
 
01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
information from parents
 
01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make sure kids grow up
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
to be independent adults
 
01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
teachers aren't telling kids to hide
 
01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:37.729 align:start position:0%
teachers aren't telling kids to hide
anything

01:16:37.729 --> 01:16:37.739 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:16:39.950 --> 01:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to give kids a safe
 
01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
space to be themselves
 
01:16:44.209 --> 01:16:44.219 align:start position:0%
and for those parents whose children
 
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
choose not to speak to them perhaps the
 
01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
conversation they should be have is why
 
01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:51.659 align:start position:0%
their kids don't feel safe to talk to
 
01:16:51.659 --> 01:16:52.669 align:start position:0%
their kids don't feel safe to talk to
them

01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
I urge you to oppose this misguided bill
 
01:16:57.649 --> 01:16:57.659 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative any
 
01:16:59.689 --> 01:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
honorable Don Johnson then
 
01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%

Laconia
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
I have a story to tell you how many of
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
you are parents
 
01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
how many would you
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
would be horrified to get a phone call
 
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
from your school that your child didn't
 
01:17:30.169 --> 01:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
get to school that day
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
you spend all day reaching out
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
asking everybody have you seen my
 
01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.229 align:start position:0%
asking everybody have you seen my
daughter

01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
no one knows
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
you finally make a phone call and you
 
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
hear that the child is all the way
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
across the other side of the state
 
01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
you have no idea why
 
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
you get there you try to get your child
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
to come out so you can take them home
 
01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
and come to find out she thinks she's a
 
01:17:58.250 --> 01:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
boy but you have no idea you can't help
 
01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
her because you don't know the school
 
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
was telling her don't tell your mother
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
will keep it your secret
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
this child was tormented internally and
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
she had no one to talk to because the
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
schools were telling her keep it to
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
yourself don't tell your parents
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
will come to find out the mother was
 
01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
horrified to know this that she could
 
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
not help her daughter
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
she pulled her daughter from the school
 
01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.310 align:start position:0%
she pulled her daughter from the school
district

01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
the doc she put a daughter in a good
 
01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
counselor that she paid for not the
 
01:18:34.199 --> 01:18:35.870 align:start position:0%
counselor that she paid for not the
state

01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
and guess what that daughter did not
 
01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
want to be a boy she wants to be a girl
 
01:18:44.050 --> 01:18:44.060 align:start position:0%
she is a beautiful young lady right now
 
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
she is thriving it's taken three years
 
01:18:50.689 --> 01:18:50.699 align:start position:0%
for her to realize as a teenager in
 
01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
middle school we all go through
 
01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
crazy body changes and you don't know
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
what's going on doesn't mean you need to
 
01:18:59.330 --> 01:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
change your sex
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
there are two Sexes male and female and
 
01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
that is it God put us on this Earth to
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
be male or female and to get a phone
 
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
call like that that you have no idea
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
where your parent your child is
 
01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
because the school has told you not to
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
say anything that's horrifying and I
 
01:19:21.169 --> 01:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
would not wish that on any parent in any
 
01:19:21.179 --> 01:19:22.310 align:start position:0%
would not wish that on any parent in any
way

01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
so please pass this bill let's protect
 
01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
our children let's protect the parents
 
01:19:31.729 --> 01:19:31.739 align:start position:0%
and let's keep America great
 
01:19:34.130 --> 01:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative Pat long and then
 
01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
representative Sharon Packard
 
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh and honorable
 
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'm Representative Patrick long
 
01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
representative Hillsboro District 23 in
 
01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
Manchester I speak in opposition to
 
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 272 I'm sure you'll have
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
several opinions on this subject matter
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
so I'll keep my testimony brief
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh one of my concerns is uh with the
 
01:20:03.649 --> 01:20:03.659 align:start position:0%
dismantling of trusted adults
 
01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
part of the state at three years old my
 
01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
parents weren't capable of raising me
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
my father moved out of state and my
 
01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
mother was diagnosed with paranoid
 
01:20:14.689 --> 01:20:14.699 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia leaving seven of ten
 
01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
siblings that were still children
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
as testified earlier creatures of the
 
01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
 
01:20:22.679 --> 01:20:23.630 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
um

01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
I'm of the opinion that trusted adults
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
in my life enabled me in considering
 
01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
positive advice not always taken however
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
but considered the trusted adult program
 
01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
I believe is is one of the best I had
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
nobody to turn to except for teachers
 
01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
coaches janitors anybody that an
 
01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
orphanage could Supply with me
 
01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:49.729 align:start position:0%
orphanage could Supply with me
um

01:20:49.729 --> 01:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
so that that is one of my concerns I
 
01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
believe that the language in Senate Bill
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
272 Begins the erosion of The Trusted
 
01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.729 align:start position:0%
272 Begins the erosion of The Trusted
adult

01:20:58.729 --> 01:20:58.739 align:start position:0%
adult
 
01:21:01.010 --> 01:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
another concern is with the violation of
 
01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
school Personnel from parents
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
specifically the fee shifting if parents
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
win the violation
 
01:21:10.729 --> 01:21:10.739 align:start position:0%
the parents shall receive its attorney
 
01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
fees and court costs
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't the taxpayer receive the
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
same consideration if we're going to be
 
01:21:20.689 --> 01:21:20.699 align:start position:0%
suing school districts taxpayer paid
 
01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
then why if a parent loses why wouldn't
 
01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
the district receive their full costs
 
01:21:27.890 --> 01:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
for for this
 
01:21:30.370 --> 01:21:30.380 align:start position:0%
so that that's the other issue I have
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
so in closing I've also I've often heard
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
that bills from bills at a solution bill
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
is a solution looking for a problem
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 272 is a solution that
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
creates several problems thank you Mr
 
01:21:49.130 --> 01:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
welcome it's yours today Mr chairman
 
01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:12.649 --> 01:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
I want to sit here stand here in support
 
01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
of Senate bill 272.
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
most you remember I was the Prime
 
01:22:20.530 --> 01:22:20.540 align:start position:0%
sponsor of House Bill 10 and
 
01:22:23.209 --> 01:22:23.219 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that got defeated in the
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
house I'm hoping and praying this bill
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:31.729 --> 01:22:31.739 align:start position:0%
what this bill does
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
it protects children
 
01:22:37.010 --> 01:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
and reaffirms parents fundamental right
 
01:22:39.290 --> 01:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
to know what is happening in their
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
children's lives
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
it reaffirms a parent's right to be
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
truthfully and completely informed
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
if the school is taking part in their
 
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
child's Identity or transition
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
it protects students from unsus from
 
01:22:57.890 --> 01:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
suspected unlawful abuse by preserving
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
the authority of the division of
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
children youth and families and other
 
01:23:05.149 --> 01:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
child welfare agencies to exercise their
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
responsibilities on behalf of any child
 
01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:09.719 align:start position:0%
that is in danger at home
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
what this bill does not do
 
01:23:15.649 --> 01:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
it does not endanger students regardless
 
01:23:20.930 --> 01:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
parents are responsible for the
 
01:23:25.370 --> 01:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
upbringing of their own children
 
01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
that's what Senate Bill 272 does but
 
01:23:30.530 --> 01:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
text parents rights and ability to be
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
100 involved in their child's daily
 
01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.970 align:start position:0%
100 involved in their child's daily
lives

01:23:34.970 --> 01:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
lives
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
we support the parents right to know
 
01:23:39.290 --> 01:23:39.300 align:start position:0%
what is happening to their children in
 
01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:40.850 align:start position:0%
what is happening to their children in
school

01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I and most parents know
 
01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
what the best decisions are for their
 
01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:47.330 align:start position:0%
what the best decisions are for their
families

01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:23:49.130 --> 01:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
we support parents who want to be
 
01:23:51.890 --> 01:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
involved in their children's lives and
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
take an active role in their education
 
01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.229 align:start position:0%
take an active role in their education
irresponsible

01:23:57.229 --> 01:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
irresponsible
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
rhetoric perpetrates the lie that school
 
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
Personnel know more than we do
 
01:24:07.850 --> 01:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.010 --> 01:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
it was a time when parents were being
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
labeled as terrorists and being attacked
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
simply for wanting basic transparency
 
01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
opponents of this legislation say it is
 
01:24:21.169 --> 01:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
dangerous and harmful
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
the only dangerous and harmful is
 
01:24:24.770 --> 01:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
believing that parents do not have the
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
right to protect their own children
 
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
these are our children
 
01:24:32.689 --> 01:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
not the states or the school districts
 
01:24:34.850 --> 01:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
it's up to us to protect and raise them
 
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
with the help and assistance
 
01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:39.719 align:start position:0%
of school officials not the other way
 
01:24:39.719 --> 01:24:41.450 align:start position:0%
of school officials not the other way
around

01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
this is what Senate Bill 272 does
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
and that is why it must be passed thank
 
01:24:50.689 --> 01:24:50.699 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and I know you have a
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%

01:25:29.450 --> 01:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
um I come here today to sort of share my
 
01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
story and the story of a close friend of
 
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
mine so my story is I'm actually a
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
bisexual man
 
01:25:36.169 --> 01:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
being bisexual obviously for those you
 
01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
don't know you're attracted to both
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
genders and it took me a while to figure
 
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
that out that's like that was a long
 
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
journey for me to figure that out and
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
was I gay was I straight was I confused
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
those are all the questions that ran
 
01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
through my my mind there were times when
 
01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
I was truly debating killing myself it
 
01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
wasn't a serious oh that's very serious
 
01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't a constant thing that I
 
01:25:56.689 --> 01:25:56.699 align:start position:0%
was struggling with but there were
 
01:25:58.330 --> 01:25:58.340 align:start position:0%
moments when I definitely felt that way
 
01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
and it was because of the confusion of
 
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
what I was it took a long time to figure
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
it out and
 
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
if I had had a teacher had to force uh
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
be forced to tell my parents I think
 
01:26:11.149 --> 01:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
that that would have been very
 
01:26:13.010 --> 01:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
detrimental to me as I was trying to
 
01:26:14.450 --> 01:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
figure out what I was it took me until
 
01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
my adulthood to figure out what I was
 
01:26:18.649 --> 01:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
and then I was able to comfortably talk
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
to my friends and family and get the
 
01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
support that I needed from them at that
 
01:26:24.129 --> 01:26:24.139 align:start position:0%
time and it wasn't always easy
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
my story would have been bad if if I was
 
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
outed by it by a school but I have a
 
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
story of a friend who is from a very
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
wealthy family and he knew from a young
 
01:26:35.709 --> 01:26:35.719 align:start position:0%
age that he was gay
 
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
he grew up in a Mormon family they were
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
not he knew they were not going to
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
accept him as gay he was very clear to
 
01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
him he said that from the beginning he
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
knew his game when he was young and um
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
so he had he's like I said he's wealthy
 
01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
he had a trust fund that was set up for
 
01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:53.219 align:start position:0%
him and upon 19 he was eligible to get
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
that trust fund because presumably he
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
could use it to go to college or
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
whatever so when he turned 19 he knew
 
01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
he'd get that trust fund he came out to
 
01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
his family and boom he has completely
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
cut out of his family and so I asked you
 
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
is that abuse in the way that we think
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
of it if a teacher heard that story if
 
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
they knew he were gay and they were
 
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
asked by under this bill by his parents
 
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
whether or not they thought he might be
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
gay and then they outed him he was cut
 
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
out of losing his trust because he
 
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
wasn't yet 19 couldn't afford to pick
 
01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:24.540 align:start position:0%
College because that's what it was set
 
01:27:27.890 --> 01:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
up for would that be considered abuse I
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
mean it's not physical but it's
 
01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
certainly emotional abusive socially
 
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
he's financially much worse off and we
 
01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
know how he would have taken he's been
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
taken out of the will as well presumably
 
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
there would have been Millions we're
 
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
talking a family with hundreds of
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
millions he's been taken away from his
 
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
his will as well so I ask you when we
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
say that all families all parents love
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
their children
 
01:27:50.930 --> 01:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
but it's not always unconditional and
 
01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
this is a good example of it so I do ask
 
01:27:54.890 --> 01:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
you to think of different perspectives
 
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
it's not just the cut and dry abuse that
 
01:27:58.370 --> 01:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
might be physical that we can all see
 
01:27:59.930 --> 01:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
with bruises on their faces but
 
01:28:02.090 --> 01:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's it's it's a deeper level
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
of abuse that still leaves a child
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
harmed thank you thank you very much

zero Psychiatry training
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
the fact that we in New Hampshire need a
 
01:30:46.490 --> 01:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
law like this and we do is proof that we
 
01:30:47.930 --> 01:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
that we have certainly entered the
 
01:30:49.850 --> 01:30:49.860 align:start position:0%

Alicia Gregg one of the representatives
 
01:31:12.410 --> 01:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
from Nashua I speak in opposition to SB
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
272 just as I did to hb10
 
01:31:18.649 --> 01:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
with approximately 35 percent of our
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
population here in New Hampshire
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
experiencing domestic violence according
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire Coalition against
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and that's only who's
 
01:31:30.890 --> 01:31:30.900 align:start position:0%
reporting so that's 35 percent we have a
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
problem it is not rare as a matter of
 
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
fact looking at the panel today seven of
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
you based on this statistic will have
 
01:31:43.370 --> 01:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
are currently in an abusive relationship
 
01:31:45.169 --> 01:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
or already have had an abusive
 
01:31:45.179 --> 01:31:46.250 align:start position:0%
or already have had an abusive
relationship

01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
we need to ask ourselves what parents
 
01:31:52.010 --> 01:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
are we helping with a bill like this who
 
01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
is not having conversations about
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
important things with their kids
 
01:31:59.570 --> 01:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
certainly not parents that have good
 
01:32:02.090 --> 01:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
relationships with their kids my
 
01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
children's biological father would have
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
been thrilled with a bill like this I
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
know most if not all of you have heard
 
01:32:11.629 --> 01:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
me testify on this floor about the
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
situation that my children and I
 
01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:14.390 align:start position:0%
situation that my children and I
survived

01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
survived
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
his view of his family was one of being
 
01:32:19.610 --> 01:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
his property
 
01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
he thought none of us had our own
 
01:32:24.530 --> 01:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
autonomy especially our children
 
01:32:26.450 --> 01:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
he thought he deserved to know every
 
01:32:29.570 --> 01:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
facet he got our texts and emails on his
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
phone he always had to know what was
 
01:32:32.159 --> 01:32:33.290 align:start position:0%
phone he always had to know what was
happening

01:32:33.290 --> 01:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
this bill does not protect kids in
 
01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
abusive homes because you don't know my
 
01:32:41.209 --> 01:32:41.219 align:start position:0%
children and I were in a situation that
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
the experts involved said was one of the
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
worst cases of domestic Terror that they
 
01:32:47.209 --> 01:32:47.219 align:start position:0%
had seen not resulting in a death during
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
the relationship
 
01:32:50.570 --> 01:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
when my children's teachers found out
 
01:32:53.330 --> 01:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
they were absolutely shocked none of
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
them had any idea
 
01:32:57.649 --> 01:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
that they had this home life domestic
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
violence is a largely hidden epidemic
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
protection for our children is not found
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
in the file cabinet with a note on it
 
01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
what better way for New Hampshire to
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
draw that line and say we are for the
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
unity of families we are also for the
 
01:33:15.770 --> 01:33:15.780 align:start position:0%
safety of our children knowing the high
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
numbers of our vulnerable that need a
 
01:33:19.490 --> 01:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
safe space than by rejecting this
 
01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
damaging bill please hold parents
 
01:33:24.290 --> 01:33:24.300 align:start position:0%
accountable and give them the honor of
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%

one that hated the school it was too big
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
for her but there's no choice I had to
 
01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
fight with her every day of the week and
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
my husband to tell her you are going to
 
01:34:12.410 --> 01:34:12.420 align:start position:0%

01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
when Nick mention of the school board
 
01:42:08.090 --> 01:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:10.669 --> 01:42:10.679 align:start position:0%
board of directors and a corporation
 
01:42:12.290 --> 01:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
School Board doesn't control down to the
 
01:42:17.890 --> 01:42:17.900 align:start position:0%
individual course construction
 
01:42:20.209 --> 01:42:20.219 align:start position:0%
courses that are taught in the school
 
01:42:22.490 --> 01:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
they provided Direction and the school
 
01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.689 --> 01:42:29.699 align:start position:0%
march to those orders
 
01:42:32.810 --> 01:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about this bill
 
01:42:35.870 --> 01:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons one of them is
 
01:42:38.450 --> 01:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate parents having
 
01:42:40.729 --> 01:42:40.739 align:start position:0%
rights that are that are discussed in
 
01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
there and there are there are rsas that
 
01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
already support a lot of what parents
 
01:42:48.530 --> 01:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
should be able to do
 
01:42:52.129 --> 01:42:52.139 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that one person one set of
 
01:42:52.139 --> 01:42:53.270 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that one person one set of
parents

01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
rights May conflict with another set of
 
01:42:58.490 --> 01:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
parents rights and it concerns me that a
 
01:42:59.689 --> 01:42:59.699 align:start position:0%
teacher is going to end up having
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
multiple course plans to try and teach
 
01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
students in their class because one set
 
01:43:07.970 --> 01:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
of parents don't want to be their child
 
01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
to be taught one way and another want
 
01:43:16.609 --> 01:43:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.129 --> 01:43:19.139 align:start position:0%
in Somersworth we struggled for six
 
01:43:20.689 --> 01:43:20.699 align:start position:0%
months to put together a transgender
 
01:43:20.699 --> 01:43:22.189 align:start position:0%
months to put together a transgender
policy

01:43:22.189 --> 01:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:43:24.290 --> 01:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
the policy we ended up coming up with
 
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
was good not complete but good
 
01:43:29.689 --> 01:43:29.699 align:start position:0%
and we support in Somersworth we support
 
01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
transgender children who have their
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
parents support
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
and the teachers are told they need to
 
01:43:39.410 --> 01:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
address those students by the name they
 
01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
identify as by the gender they identify
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
as and by the pronouns they want to use
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
it does leave a hole for those children
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
that aren't supported by their children
 
01:43:49.679 --> 01:43:50.930 align:start position:0%
that aren't supported by their children
but

01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:43:52.609 --> 01:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
children that are having trouble trying
 
01:43:54.770 --> 01:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
to talk to their parents that's what I
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
had a problem with back in the 1960s
 
01:44:00.649 --> 01:44:00.659 align:start position:0%
I was a mediocre student
 
01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
but I couldn't share what was going on
 
01:44:06.530 --> 01:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
with me with my loving parents and I was
 
01:44:08.810 --> 01:44:08.820 align:start position:0%
current because the community wouldn't
 
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
understand and I would embarrass my
 
01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:12.109 align:start position:0%
understand and I would embarrass my
parents

01:44:12.109 --> 01:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
I didn't come out until I was 45 years
 
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
some of the problems
 
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
associated with school especially for
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
gender identity is is that in the case
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
of ask talking to a teacher
 
01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
who should be using
 
01:44:40.010 --> 01:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
their the name
 
01:44:41.810 --> 01:44:41.820 align:start position:0%
listed on the system
 
01:44:43.609 --> 01:44:43.619 align:start position:0%
is that the name that they may be given
 
01:44:45.649 --> 01:44:45.659 align:start position:0%
by the student might be the name that
 
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
the parent expects them to be called
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
it may not be their legal name to start
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
off with but they may be in the process
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
and part of the challenge is a child in
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
school with a gender identity concerned
 
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
in the process of working with doctors
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
and psychiatrists and therapists and
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
their parents represented you running
 
01:45:10.850 --> 01:45:10.860 align:start position:0%

committee for having to
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
be those that have this very difficult
 
01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:35.639 align:start position:0%
decision to make
 
01:45:39.169 --> 01:45:39.179 align:start position:0%
I'm here not to tell you how I feel I'm
 
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
here to tell you that I promised my
 
01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:43.129 align:start position:0%
here to tell you that I promised my
constituents

01:45:43.129 --> 01:45:43.139 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
that I was going to vote for them
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
not my conscience and there's a lot of
 
01:45:49.729 --> 01:45:49.739 align:start position:0%
talk here when you're a representative
 
01:45:52.189 --> 01:45:52.199 align:start position:0%
about should I vote my conscience or
 
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
should I not
 
01:45:55.250 --> 01:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to do that I'm going to
 
01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
vote for my constituents and what I'm
 
01:45:59.330 --> 01:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
telling you folks on the committee
 
01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
the people in Bristol and Bridgewater
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
the majority they have spoken to are in
 
01:46:06.649 --> 01:46:06.659 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill
 
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's as simple as that and the
 
01:46:11.090 --> 01:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
conversation that I get from that is
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
when people hear
 
01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
that a teacher may not have to tell a
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
parent something about their child they
 
01:46:20.930 --> 01:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
literally say what are you kidding me
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
that can't be right
 
01:46:25.250 --> 01:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
that it can't be right that a teacher
 
01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
can withhold something from a parent
 
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
about their child so I'm here to ask you
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'm telling you I'm here to support this
 
01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
for my constituents not for myself and I
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%

hi everybody my name is Heather Raymond
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
I'm the current state rep for
 
01:46:55.490 --> 01:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough District 5 Nashua before
 
01:46:57.649 --> 01:46:57.659 align:start position:0%
running for this office I've dedicated
 
01:46:59.689 --> 01:46:59.699 align:start position:0%
my life to serving children and families
 
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
in my community I was a forensic
 
01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
interviewer working with the New York
 
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
State Police to interview child victims
 
01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
of sexual violence for five years then
 
01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
when my family moved to New Hampshire I
 
01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
worked for dcyf as first an assessment
 
01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
worker and then a foster care case
 
01:47:17.149 --> 01:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
worker then I worked for Casa as a
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
program manager supervising Court
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
advocates for children in foster care I
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
stopped working a full a few years ago
 
01:47:26.330 --> 01:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
due to a brain tumor but I continued my
 
01:47:28.250 --> 01:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
advocacy for Children and Families by
 
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
running for the Board of Education in
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
Nashua where I served as the president
 
01:47:34.729 --> 01:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
for several years the clerk and I'm now
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
the chair of the policy committee so my
 
01:47:39.770 --> 01:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
narrow areas of expertise exactly
 
01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
coincide with the matters under
 
01:47:44.810 --> 01:47:44.820 align:start position:0%
consideration and SB 272
 
01:47:46.970 --> 01:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
let me Begin by reminding this committee
 
01:47:49.850 --> 01:47:49.860 align:start position:0%
that I spoke on the sister bill hb10 in
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
the well last month many of my concerns
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
for hb10 are transferable to asb272 this
 
01:48:00.890 --> 01:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
bill has been opposed by every major
 
01:48:02.990 --> 01:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
child advocacy group in the state
 
01:48:05.810 --> 01:48:05.820 align:start position:0%
including Nami New Hampshire Waypoint
 
01:48:08.450 --> 01:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
Seacoast Outreach and most importantly
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
the office of the New Hampshire child
 
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
advocate the legislature created the
 
01:48:16.010 --> 01:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
Office of the child advocate after a
 
01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
number of high-profile child deaths in
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
the state to help us attend to our
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
mandate to prioritize the best interests
 
01:48:26.830 --> 01:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
of children when considering legislation
 
01:48:29.930 --> 01:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
sb272 fails this critical test because
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
it seeks to seeks to undermine the
 
01:48:33.709 --> 01:48:33.719 align:start position:0%
current mandated reporting law to dcif
 
01:48:36.649 --> 01:48:36.659 align:start position:0%
by creating a new higher standard for
 
01:48:38.570 --> 01:48:38.580 align:start position:0%
school Personnel when considering child
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
safety SB 272 requires that the reporter
 
01:48:44.930 --> 01:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
have clear and convincing evidence for
 
01:48:47.810 --> 01:48:47.820 align:start position:0%
concerns and institutes a new unfunded
 
01:48:50.330 --> 01:48:50.340 align:start position:0%
mandate for documentation the current
 
01:48:53.689 --> 01:48:53.699 align:start position:0%
threshold under state law for dcyf is a
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence
 
01:48:58.910 --> 01:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
this will increase the danger for

households anyone watching the news
 
01:49:05.629 --> 01:49:05.639 align:start position:0%
these days knows that New Hampshire has
 
01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
a problem with parents who take things
 
01:49:09.649 --> 01:49:09.659 align:start position:0%
too far the last thing our community
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
needs is to make it easier for abusive
 
01:49:14.930 --> 01:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
parents to utilize institutions to
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
further control and harm children
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
the second test for consideration
 
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
regarding bills for bills regarding
 
01:49:24.050 --> 01:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
children in schools is whether the bill
 
01:49:26.209 --> 01:49:26.219 align:start position:0%
is in the academic best interests of
 
01:49:26.219 --> 01:49:27.430 align:start position:0%
is in the academic best interests of
children

01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:49:30.770 --> 01:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
sb272 fails this test this bill will
 
01:49:32.570 --> 01:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
undermine our children's success by
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
requiring teachers to focus on tracking
 
01:49:36.649 --> 01:49:36.659 align:start position:0%
students romantic and personal lives
 
01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
instead of leaving those private family
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
matters alone and sticking to their
 
01:49:43.669 --> 01:49:43.679 align:start position:0%
academic content areas it should be
 
01:49:46.129 --> 01:49:46.139 align:start position:0%
noted that items a through S in the
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill are already in State
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
Statute and I printed this information
 
01:49:54.410 --> 01:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
for the committee's review
 
01:49:57.729 --> 01:49:57.739 align:start position:0%
this is already representative
 
01:50:00.649 --> 01:50:00.659 align:start position:0%
education's website
 
01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
if you have written testimony we'd
 
01:50:04.850 --> 01:50:04.860 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you
 
01:50:09.649 --> 01:50:09.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:12.290 --> 01:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
01:50:14.450 --> 01:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chair for the record I am Senator
 
01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
Deborah alchiller from District 24. I'll
 
01:50:19.850 --> 01:50:19.860 align:start position:0%
provide my testimony at the end you've
 
01:50:21.709 --> 01:50:21.719 align:start position:0%
been asked today to keep an open mind
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
and you've been told children are the
 
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
possession of parents and indeed I urge
 
01:50:29.209 --> 01:50:29.219 align:start position:0%
you all to keep an open mind and
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
remember that children are people
 
01:50:33.950 --> 01:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
they're not chattel parents are
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
responsible for their children they're
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to provide them with care and
 
01:50:40.729 --> 01:50:40.739 align:start position:0%
keeping provide for their medical care
 
01:50:43.729 --> 01:50:43.739 align:start position:0%
shelter food and clothing can we
 
01:50:46.189 --> 01:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
legislate parents to love their children
 
01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
can we legislate that parents should
 
01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
protect their children no we can't in
 
01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
fact you heard today that teachers are
 
01:50:57.229 --> 01:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
now going to be responsible for
 
01:50:58.970 --> 01:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
reporting out to parents so that
 
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
children must engage in what has been
 
01:51:04.209 --> 01:51:04.219 align:start position:0%
described from this microphone as
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable conversations what could
 
01:51:09.590 --> 01:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
possibly be uncomfortable
 
01:51:11.930 --> 01:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
would it be because some parents
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't approach what has been called
 
01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
an uncomfortable conversation with Grace
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
understanding and open minds you have
 
01:51:21.229 --> 01:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
heard from my colleague from this
 
01:51:23.209 --> 01:51:23.219 align:start position:0%
microphone that this will make the
 
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
problem worse
 
01:51:26.750 --> 01:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
what problem
 
01:51:29.689 --> 01:51:29.699 align:start position:0%
are parents having problems they need
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
the legislature to solve this bill
 
01:51:34.370 --> 01:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
states that parents May Sue an educator
 
01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
for declaratory damages if they believe
 
01:51:39.709 --> 01:51:39.719 align:start position:0%
the educator has violated this upcoming
 
01:51:42.410 --> 01:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
law this bill is designed to assume that
 
01:51:45.169 --> 01:51:45.179 align:start position:0%
every parent has just somehow missed out
 
01:51:47.629 --> 01:51:47.639 align:start position:0%
on the opportunity to talk with their
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
children about their gender identity
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
think about this as a parent and there
 
01:51:54.729 --> 01:51:54.739 align:start position:0%
are lots of us in the room here today
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
did you create a gender neutral home and
 
01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:01.860 align:start position:0%
specifically create spaces for your
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
child to explore their own identities
 
01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
was that provided to you
 
01:52:10.669 --> 01:52:10.679 align:start position:0%
I would Hazard that the answer is no we
 
01:52:13.070 --> 01:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
live in a society that assumes certain
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
gender norms and only one percent of our
 
01:52:19.850 --> 01:52:19.860 align:start position:0%
population doesn't conform to that
 
01:52:22.129 --> 01:52:22.139 align:start position:0%
standard and even fewer have the
 
01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to figure out who they are
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
with their family and community support
 
01:52:29.390 --> 01:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
for that exploration parents have rights
 
01:52:33.470 --> 01:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
sure they also have responsibilities if
 
01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
parents were all excellent we wouldn't
 
01:52:37.370 --> 01:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
need a Department of Youth and families
 
01:52:39.530 --> 01:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't need an office of the child
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
advocate we wouldn't need child
 
01:52:44.209 --> 01:52:44.219 align:start position:0%
protection laws we wouldn't need the
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
safe adult program the sad reality is we
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
do parents need to take responsibility
 
01:52:53.090 --> 01:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
for their own relationships they
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't need to be pumping the other
 
01:52:57.050 --> 01:52:57.060 align:start position:0%
adults in children's lives for
 
01:52:58.850 --> 01:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
information right
 
01:53:01.070 --> 01:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
they should we they should be working to
 
01:53:02.689 --> 01:53:02.699 align:start position:0%
keep the lines of communication open
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
right they should be treating their
 
01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
children with respect due to any human
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
being just trying to figure out who they
 
01:53:12.109 --> 01:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
are who they want to be and how they
 
01:53:14.330 --> 01:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
want to live their life if a parent's
 
01:53:17.810 --> 01:53:17.820 align:start position:0%
relationship is so weak so tenuous that
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
it is threatened by a teacher using a
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
new nickname for a child who is doing
 
01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
the business of growing that's the
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
parents problem suing Educators because
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
parents haven't created a safe space at
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
home to have so-called difficult
 
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
conversations is nothing short of
 
01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and I urge you to reject this
 
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you thank you senator
 
01:53:46.490 --> 01:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
representative Popovich Mueller then
 
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:55.010 --> 01:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:53:56.450 --> 01:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
committee and everybody in the audience
 
01:53:58.490 --> 01:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
for being here obviously this is one of
 
01:54:01.330 --> 01:54:01.340 align:start position:0%
those bills that does attract a lot of
 
01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
controversy and it's good to hear
 
01:54:06.109 --> 01:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
everybody speaking politely and kindly
 
01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
for or against it at the end of the day
 
01:54:10.370 --> 01:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
we are here to
 
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
express our thoughts and let the people
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
who are going to vote you know vote
 
01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:16.679 align:start position:0%
their conscience
 
01:54:18.890 --> 01:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking as a republican from
 
01:54:21.290 --> 01:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
Windham but more specifically there is a
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
republican from Windham that while being
 
01:54:25.129 --> 01:54:25.139 align:start position:0%
on the school board
 
01:54:27.590 --> 01:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
pushed for the very controversial
 
01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
transgender rights you know jbab policy
 
01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
and got it passed so I'm not your you
 
01:54:35.629 --> 01:54:35.639 align:start position:0%
know predictable person let's put it
 
01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
this way I voted for that because I felt
 
01:54:40.669 --> 01:54:40.679 align:start position:0%
it was necessary to protect the rights
 
01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:42.659 align:start position:0%
of those kids who need to find their own
 
01:54:42.659 --> 01:54:43.550 align:start position:0%
of those kids who need to find their own
way

01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
but to address a couple of the things
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
that were said earlier
 
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
this bill as proposed does not have
 
01:54:52.189 --> 01:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
anything to do with changing the
 
01:54:54.649 --> 01:54:54.659 align:start position:0%
requirements for mandatory reporting the
 
01:54:56.330 --> 01:54:56.340 align:start position:0%
clear and compelling interest in the
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
bill refers to the circumstances in
 
01:55:00.410 --> 01:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
which the school does not meet the
 
01:55:03.470 --> 01:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
threshold to report the dcyf but decides
 
01:55:05.450 --> 01:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
internally to violate certain parent
 
01:55:07.729 --> 01:55:07.739 align:start position:0%
rights those are very separate parts of
 
01:55:09.290 --> 01:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
01:55:11.689 --> 01:55:11.699 align:start position:0%
I will also say that I don't think that
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
anybody speaking here should be ashamed
 
01:55:15.410 --> 01:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
or embarrassed just because they're
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
expressing a point of view other people
 
01:55:19.609 --> 01:55:19.619 align:start position:0%
may disagree with this is not the way I
 
01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
feel politics should be conducted and
 
01:55:23.330 --> 01:55:23.340 align:start position:0%
this is definitely not the way I
 
01:55:26.330 --> 01:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
approach legislation
 
01:55:28.970 --> 01:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
you do need a bill of parental rights
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day there are
 
01:55:33.649 --> 01:55:33.659 align:start position:0%
quite a few School administrations who
 
01:55:36.890 --> 01:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
feel that they don't necessarily have to
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
serve their parents and protect their
 
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:40.679 align:start position:0%
rights but they have to do things
 
01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
because they know better than the
 
01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:44.149 align:start position:0%
because they know better than the
parents

01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:55:46.970 --> 01:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
and this is not the right culture yes
 
01:55:48.649 --> 01:55:48.659 align:start position:0%
there will always be edge cases there
 
01:55:50.450 --> 01:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
will always be parents who may not
 
01:55:52.189 --> 01:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily do the right things that's
 
01:55:54.410 --> 01:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
why we have the dcyf that's why we have
 
01:55:56.090 --> 01:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
the provisions in this law to address
 
01:55:58.669 --> 01:55:58.679 align:start position:0%
those cases but overall we should
 
01:56:00.590 --> 01:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
respect the rights of the parents to
 
01:56:03.169 --> 01:56:03.179 align:start position:0%
control their kids education remember
 
01:56:06.649 --> 01:56:06.659 align:start position:0%
Public Schools we have laws that require
 
01:56:09.410 --> 01:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
kids to be educated we are mandating
 
01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
that people get that education and
 
01:56:13.850 --> 01:56:13.860 align:start position:0%
therefore we should give them the rights
 
01:56:15.950 --> 01:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
to control that education in certain
 
01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.149 align:start position:0%
to control that education in certain
ways

01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
ways
 
01:56:19.370 --> 01:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
so the last
 
01:56:22.189 --> 01:56:22.199 align:start position:0%
point that I want to make is that there
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
is a very controversial provision in the
 
01:56:26.090 --> 01:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
law according to everybody I speak with
 
01:56:28.490 --> 01:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
in regards to the school being required
 
01:56:31.729 --> 01:56:31.739 align:start position:0%
to disclose if the kid is openly you
 
01:56:34.910 --> 01:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
know um came out of the closet at school
 
01:56:37.010 --> 01:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
and to keep that a secret from their
 
01:56:39.709 --> 01:56:39.719 align:start position:0%
parents All I'm gonna say in regards to
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
that provision is I have no idea why
 
01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's controversial because I cannot
 
01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
think of one situation in which a kid
 
01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
comes out at school
 
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
and everybody in town doesn't know about
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
it in a few weeks seriously schools
 
01:56:55.609 --> 01:56:55.619 align:start position:0%
gossip everybody talks and I see the red
 
01:56:57.770 --> 01:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
flag which means I'm reaching out of my
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
the end of my time so I want to just
 
01:57:01.490 --> 01:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank everybody for taking the time
 
01:57:03.290 --> 01:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
every member of the committee knows how
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
to reach me if they want further
 
01:57:07.129 --> 01:57:07.139 align:start position:0%
comments and I'll leave it at that thank
 
01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much representative
 
01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond followed by
 
01:57:25.550 --> 01:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:27.709 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:57:27.709 --> 01:57:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:33.790 --> 01:57:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
okay so represent representative uh
 
01:57:43.129 --> 01:57:43.139 align:start position:0%
she spoke okay sure Mana
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman honorable
 
01:57:47.209 --> 01:57:47.219 align:start position:0%
colleagues I stand today in opposition
 
01:57:51.770 --> 01:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
to SB 272 section 3A States the nothing
 
01:57:53.930 --> 01:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
in the bill shall authorize a parent of
 
01:57:56.990 --> 01:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
a minor child in this state to engage in
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
conduct that is unlawful or to abuse or
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
neglect his or her mine or child in
 
01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
violation of General law this is an
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
argument we heard many times today and
 
01:58:09.530 --> 01:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
with regard to hb10 we are assured that
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
any parent who abuses their child will
 
01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
be punished
 
01:58:15.050 --> 01:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
punishment of the perpetrator means
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
little when we should have been focusing
 
01:58:19.010 --> 01:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
on helping to prevent the abuse in the
 
01:58:20.209 --> 01:58:20.219 align:start position:0%
first place
 
01:58:22.370 --> 01:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
the American Academy of Pediatrics has
 
01:58:25.070 --> 01:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
reported the transgender youth are
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
significantly more likely to be
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
psychologically or physically abused
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
than their cisgender peers the center
 
01:58:34.370 --> 01:58:34.380 align:start position:0%
for American progress reports that 20 to
 
01:58:36.290 --> 01:58:36.300 align:start position:0%
40 percent of homeless youth are gay or
 
01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
transgender compared to only five to ten
 
01:58:41.810 --> 01:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
percent of the overall youth population
 
01:58:43.970 --> 01:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
leaving aside for a moment the fact that
 
01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of psychological abuse
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
goes unreported and unpunished punishing
 
01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
an abusive parent after the fact does
 
01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
nothing to undo the damage they have
 
01:58:56.570 --> 01:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
caused it certainly does nothing to heal
 
01:58:58.850 --> 01:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
the wounds they have left behind
 
01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
most children can and will talk to their
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
parents if they have questions about
 
01:59:04.430 --> 01:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
their sexual orientation or gender
 
01:59:07.129 --> 01:59:07.139 align:start position:0%
identity and most parents I believe will
 
01:59:09.169 --> 01:59:09.179 align:start position:0%
listen to and love their children even
 
01:59:11.330 --> 01:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
when they make choices their parents do
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
not fully understand or even like
 
01:59:16.129 --> 01:59:16.139 align:start position:0%
children who do not have those support
 
01:59:18.530 --> 01:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
structures and who genuinely fear the
 
01:59:20.330 --> 01:59:20.340 align:start position:0%
repercussions of revealing their true
 
01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
selves however need safe spaces where
 
01:59:25.970 --> 01:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
they can be themselves and laugh and
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
love and grow even if it is not within
 
01:59:30.109 --> 01:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
the family
 
01:59:32.209 --> 01:59:32.219 align:start position:0%
we are constantly told the parents know
 
01:59:34.609 --> 01:59:34.619 align:start position:0%
their children but why do we not also
 
01:59:37.010 --> 01:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
hear that children know their parents
 
01:59:39.709 --> 01:59:39.719 align:start position:0%
certainly far better than you or I
 
01:59:41.570 --> 01:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
sitting here in Concord
 
01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:43.619 align:start position:0%
if one of my children felt for whatever
 
01:59:45.950 --> 01:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
reason they could not come to me to talk
 
01:59:48.410 --> 01:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
about intimate questions and concerns I
 
01:59:50.089 --> 01:59:50.099 align:start position:0%
would of course be hurt
 
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
but my child is not my property
 
01:59:54.890 --> 01:59:54.900 align:start position:0%
my love for my child and my
 
01:59:56.750 --> 01:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility to care for and nurture
 
01:59:59.570 --> 01:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
my child does not give me property
 
02:00:01.250 --> 02:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
rights over them
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
I would want them to have a responsible
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
adult whom they trusted with whom they
 
02:00:08.510 --> 02:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
could talk I would want what is best for
 
02:00:10.370 --> 02:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
them I would want them to get the care
 
02:00:12.890 --> 02:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
that they need period
 
02:00:14.689 --> 02:00:14.699 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from a number of
 
02:00:17.570 --> 02:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
young people on HB 10 who said that they
 
02:00:19.129 --> 02:00:19.139 align:start position:0%
could not have spoken to their parents
 
02:00:21.470 --> 02:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
about their sexual orientation or gender
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
identity for fear of abuse or being
 
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
kicked out of their homes
 
02:00:27.770 --> 02:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
they said that they did not know what
 
02:00:29.330 --> 02:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
they would have done or what they might
 
02:00:31.490 --> 02:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
have done to themselves if they did not
 
02:00:33.770 --> 02:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
have a place to go every day where they
 
02:00:35.930 --> 02:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
felt free to be who where they were
 
02:00:37.970 --> 02:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
with people they trusted and respected
 
02:00:39.229 --> 02:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
to talk to
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
why are we not talking about their
 
02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:43.430 align:start position:0%
why are we not talking about their
rights

02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's what we should be talking about
 
02:00:47.149 --> 02:00:47.159 align:start position:0%
today I want to talk about is rightfully
 
02:00:49.970 --> 02:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
the child's this is an inalienable right
 
02:00:52.189 --> 02:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
which is inseparable from the rights to
 
02:00:55.129 --> 02:00:55.139 align:start position:0%
life liberty and pursuit of happiness I
 
02:00:56.990 --> 02:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
strongly urge you to vote ought not to
 
02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
pass thank you very much representative
 
02:01:07.910 --> 02:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:10.370 --> 02:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair and committee
 
02:01:12.770 --> 02:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony I'm
 
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
here today to ask you to um i.tl this
 
02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:16.669 align:start position:0%
here today to ask you to um i.tl this
bill

02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:16.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:01:19.010 --> 02:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
there are two types of people in the
 
02:01:21.950 --> 02:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
room here today those of us who have had
 
02:01:24.109 --> 02:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
the experience of coming out to our
 
02:01:26.689 --> 02:01:26.699 align:start position:0%
parents and those of us who have not
 
02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
I employ the committee to listen to
 
02:01:30.589 --> 02:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
those of us who have lived this
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
experience we're United in telling you
 
02:01:36.290 --> 02:01:36.300 align:start position:0%
that this bill is dangerous and it puts
 
02:01:38.570 --> 02:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
trans children in danger and let me
 
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
explain why
 
02:01:43.970 --> 02:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
the fear of rejection is overwhelming
 
02:01:47.689 --> 02:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:50.089 --> 02:01:50.099 align:start position:0%
and that fear is greatest When It's
 
02:01:52.609 --> 02:01:52.619 align:start position:0%
associated with your parents let me say
 
02:01:54.229 --> 02:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
that my mother was not the first person
 
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
I came out to and she wasn't even the
 
02:01:56.520 --> 02:01:57.950 align:start position:0%
I came out to and she wasn't even the
second

02:01:57.950 --> 02:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:01:59.810 --> 02:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
children become aware that they are
 
02:02:02.209 --> 02:02:02.219 align:start position:0%
somehow innately different when they're
 
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
very young different from the siblings
 
02:02:06.530 --> 02:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
different from the parents
 
02:02:08.510 --> 02:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
and they learn to keep those differences
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
secret when they're very young as well
 
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
they learn that the society stigmatizes
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
being LGBT
 
02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
they hear the queer jokes they see the
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
news about hearings like this and they
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
internalize the transphobia that they
 
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
see in here in society
 
02:02:30.169 --> 02:02:30.179 align:start position:0%
coming to terms with being different in
 
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
this way is a frightening process and
 
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
the fear of rejection can often push
 
02:02:38.570 --> 02:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
children to do self-harm a child needs a
 
02:02:40.129 --> 02:02:40.139 align:start position:0%
safe place to learn how to accept
 
02:02:42.410 --> 02:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
themselves before they come out to
 
02:02:45.410 --> 02:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
others outing a child before they're
 
02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
ready especially to a parent can drive
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
that child to self-harm and indeed to

children are four times higher than
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
their heterosexual counterparts and I
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
have no doubt that if the language in
 
02:03:05.089 --> 02:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
this bill becomes lower somewhere in the
 
02:03:07.010 --> 02:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire a child will kill
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
themselves and their parents will spend
 
02:03:12.290 --> 02:03:12.300 align:start position:0%
the rest of their lives wondering why
 
02:03:15.290 --> 02:03:15.300 align:start position:0%
I say to you today that if there is a
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
one chance in a million that legislation
 
02:03:21.290 --> 02:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
you enact will drive a child to commit
 
02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
suicide you must vote itl
 
02:03:27.169 --> 02:03:27.179 align:start position:0%

I am a freshman representative from
 
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
Londonderry New Hampshire I had
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely no intent content of speaking
 
02:03:46.970 --> 02:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
today but I am here as a legislator
 
02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
because parents put me here
 
02:03:53.689 --> 02:03:53.699 align:start position:0%
I spent two years speaking for parents
 
02:03:55.850 --> 02:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
at school board meetings at Town
 
02:03:55.860 --> 02:03:56.870 align:start position:0%
at school board meetings at Town
meetings

02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
then they asked me to run they asked me
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
to run because they needed a voice here
 
02:04:08.330 --> 02:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
I am the voice of those parents it had
 
02:04:12.410 --> 02:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with any particular
 
02:04:16.669 --> 02:04:16.679 align:start position:0%
type of child any particular gender it
 
02:04:19.250 --> 02:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
had to do with the fact that there were
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
many reasons why these parents felt that
 
02:04:27.530 --> 02:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
they did not have a voice in the schools
 
02:04:31.490 --> 02:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
that's why I am here this is about the
 
02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:32.570 align:start position:0%
that's why I am here this is about the
parents

02:04:32.570 --> 02:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
parents
 
02:04:34.490 --> 02:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
this is about
 
02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
all the children all the children we
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
cannot provide I had a grandfather say
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
to me we cannot provide
 
02:04:47.930 --> 02:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
equity for a hundred percent of the
 
02:04:50.270 --> 02:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
people the children and the parents a
 
02:04:53.209 --> 02:04:53.219 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of the time but we need
 
02:04:57.709 --> 02:04:57.719 align:start position:0%
to provide safety for all the children
 
02:05:01.550 --> 02:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
all of the time especially in sensitive
 
02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:03.290 align:start position:0%
all of the time especially in sensitive
situations

02:05:03.290 --> 02:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
situations
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
parents are the number one lovers of
 
02:05:09.410 --> 02:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
their children we don't all agree with
 
02:05:13.010 --> 02:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
them we all get angry with them but more
 
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
are far more parents out there that
 
02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
accept their children
 
02:05:20.209 --> 02:05:20.219 align:start position:0%
for who they are
 
02:05:24.050 --> 02:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
always think of those parents they need
 
02:05:28.370 --> 02:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
a voice too please pass this bill my
 
02:05:30.550 --> 02:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
constituents were heartbroken
 
02:05:33.950 --> 02:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
heartbroken that the house
 
02:05:36.770 --> 02:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
parental rights Bill failed
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%

welcome

welcome
 
02:06:17.450 --> 02:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
I apologize you caught me by surprise
 
02:06:20.209 --> 02:06:20.219 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Diane Martin I
 
02:06:21.770 --> 02:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
am the director of the administrative
 
02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
office of the courts and I am not here
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
to take a position on the policy related
 
02:06:30.050 --> 02:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
to this bill I am just here to ask for
 
02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
an amendment I shared the amendment with
 
02:06:35.089 --> 02:06:35.099 align:start position:0%
the chair and members of the committee
 
02:06:35.099 --> 02:06:36.109 align:start position:0%
the chair and members of the committee
yesterday

02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
02:06:38.030 --> 02:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
and we also shared this with Senator
 
02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:38.990 align:start position:0%
and we also shared this with Senator
Carson

02:06:38.990 --> 02:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
Carson
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
we are looking to uh
 
02:06:46.250 --> 02:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
amend the bill to remove RSA 186 colon
 
02:06:50.570 --> 02:06:50.580 align:start position:0%
11 comma Roman numeral 9C
 
02:06:54.290 --> 02:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
the reference in section c
 
02:06:56.209 --> 02:06:56.219 align:start position:0%
the intent of the section of this bill
 
02:06:58.729 --> 02:06:58.739 align:start position:0%
is to provide that the chapter not
 
02:07:00.830 --> 02:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
applied to a court law enforcement
 
02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
officer or government agency responsible
 
02:07:06.109 --> 02:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
for child welfare acting in their
 
02:07:07.970 --> 02:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
official capacity
 
02:07:10.129 --> 02:07:10.139 align:start position:0%
the statutory reference we are asking to
 
02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
be removed is a duty of the State Board
 
02:07:14.330 --> 02:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
of Education and not a duty of the
 
02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
courts and so we would ask that that
 
02:07:18.890 --> 02:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
provision be removed to clarify this
 
02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:20.209 align:start position:0%
provision be removed to clarify this
bill

02:07:20.209 --> 02:07:20.219 align:start position:0%

02:07:29.149 --> 02:07:29.159 align:start position:0%
with all the committee members thank you
 
02:07:30.770 --> 02:07:30.780 align:start position:0%

02:07:33.410 --> 02:07:33.420 align:start position:0%

02:07:36.109 --> 02:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
stretch up stretch a little bit and have
 
02:07:38.629 --> 02:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
a bite to eat then we'll come back in a
 
02:45:23.750 --> 02:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:27.889 --> 02:45:27.899 align:start position:0%

02:45:57.770 --> 02:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:02.630 --> 02:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:05.510 --> 02:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
Karen Hill's not here
 
02:46:18.770 --> 02:46:18.780 align:start position:0%

nice to see you representative
 
02:46:30.830 --> 02:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
02:46:32.870 --> 02:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
I was not expecting to be called so
 
02:46:34.670 --> 02:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
quickly so I just will pull up my
 
02:46:36.530 --> 02:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
testimony here it is
 
02:46:38.630 --> 02:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:46:40.670 --> 02:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to testify in opposition
 
02:46:42.349 --> 02:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
to this legislation known as the
 
02:46:44.270 --> 02:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
parental Bill of Rights we've heard
 
02:46:45.950 --> 02:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
people say that parents know what is
 
02:46:47.990 --> 02:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
best for their children they have said
 
02:46:51.170 --> 02:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
that this bill protects children
 
02:46:54.469 --> 02:46:54.479 align:start position:0%
but it's time for us to face reality
 
02:46:56.990 --> 02:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
there is a child safety crisis happening
 
02:46:58.490 --> 02:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
02:47:01.130 --> 02:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
Harmony Montgomery was five years old
 
02:47:04.309 --> 02:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
when she was murdered her own father was
 
02:47:06.050 --> 02:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
charged in her death
 
02:47:08.210 --> 02:47:08.220 align:start position:0%
Brielle Gage was three years old when
 
02:47:10.130 --> 02:47:10.140 align:start position:0%
she was beaten to death by her mother
 
02:47:13.730 --> 02:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
and those are cases that dcyf was
 
02:47:16.370 --> 02:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
actually involved in there are far more
 
02:47:19.790 --> 02:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
that go unreported and unaccounted for
 
02:47:21.650 --> 02:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
these children would certainly have
 
02:47:23.990 --> 02:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
benefited from State resources and
 
02:47:25.849 --> 02:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
attention being focused on the plight of
 
02:47:28.610 --> 02:47:28.620 align:start position:0%
at-risk children in New Hampshire and
 
02:47:31.010 --> 02:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
the current biennium there were 22 dcyf
 
02:47:33.170 --> 02:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
positions proposed an emotion was made
 
02:47:35.570 --> 02:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
to cut that in half and to only fund
 
02:47:37.670 --> 02:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
them if needed
 
02:47:40.010 --> 02:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
the state is literally ignoring and
 
02:47:42.170 --> 02:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
underfunding a known group of at-risk
 
02:47:44.510 --> 02:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
children if people want to protect
 
02:47:46.849 --> 02:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
children in New Hampshire there are some
 
02:47:49.730 --> 02:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
very practical and real steps that we
 
02:47:50.690 --> 02:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
can take
 
02:47:53.630 --> 02:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is not one of them
 
02:47:55.910 --> 02:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
in fact nearly every single right in
 
02:47:58.670 --> 02:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is already existing in state
 
02:48:02.150 --> 02:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
law and provided to parents if a parent
 
02:48:03.830 --> 02:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
wants to know what classes their child
 
02:48:05.570 --> 02:48:05.580 align:start position:0%
is taking if they want to know what
 
02:48:07.969 --> 02:48:07.979 align:start position:0%
books are being assigned and films are
 
02:48:09.469 --> 02:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
being watched if they want to prevent
 
02:48:11.870 --> 02:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
their child from participating in sex
 
02:48:14.510 --> 02:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
education they already have the ability
 
02:48:17.330 --> 02:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
to do all of these things what this bill
 
02:48:20.389 --> 02:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
actually does is to Target one
 
02:48:22.610 --> 02:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
particular group of minors for
 
02:48:25.730 --> 02:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
surveillance in school
 
02:48:29.090 --> 02:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
this is outright discrimination and it
 
02:48:31.070 --> 02:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
is inconsistent with New Hampshire
 
02:48:34.490 --> 02:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
values of freedom and equality not only
 
02:48:36.290 --> 02:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
does this bill fail to protect children
 
02:48:39.469 --> 02:48:39.479 align:start position:0%
it actually harms them
 
02:48:42.410 --> 02:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
my own 16 year old testified last month
 
02:48:47.030 --> 02:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
against both SB 272 and hb10 and is not
 
02:48:48.170 --> 02:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
available today due to school
 
02:48:50.690 --> 02:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
obligations so in conclusion I will
 
02:48:52.670 --> 02:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
reiterate the first-hand testimony that
 
02:48:56.450 --> 02:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
my own child previously provided
 
02:48:59.270 --> 02:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
my name is Zoe Hill I am a 16 year old
 
02:49:01.969 --> 02:49:01.979 align:start position:0%
Junior at Lebanon High School I am here
 
02:49:05.690 --> 02:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
today to oppose SB 272 this bill will
 
02:49:07.490 --> 02:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
not directly affect me because I am
 
02:49:09.650 --> 02:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
lucky enough to have parents who support
 
02:49:13.250 --> 02:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
me and my identity as a trans kid but I
 
02:49:15.349 --> 02:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
know multiple people who could face harm
 
02:49:18.710 --> 02:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes they are out in
 
02:49:21.170 --> 02:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
school but not at home because their
 
02:49:23.870 --> 02:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
families might not accept them if this
 
02:49:25.730 --> 02:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
bill passes and their parents found out
 
02:49:27.950 --> 02:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
they are trans then their homes would
 
02:49:30.110 --> 02:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
become an even more dangerous place for
 
02:49:33.590 --> 02:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
them in conclusion please oppose this
 
02:49:36.410 --> 02:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
bill for the sake of trans kids all
 
02:49:37.730 --> 02:49:37.740 align:start position:0%

state parents have no rights I was
 
02:50:45.110 --> 02:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
subjected to the whims of central
 
02:50:48.469 --> 02:50:48.479 align:start position:0%
planners and their forced indoctrination
 
02:50:50.870 --> 02:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
the CCP had full control over education
 
02:50:53.090 --> 02:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
from curricula to standards from testing
 
02:50:55.010 --> 02:50:55.020 align:start position:0%

here's my child portrait in middle
 
02:51:01.250 --> 02:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
school which I will give you when I'm
 
02:51:03.410 --> 02:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
done and which was used in my student
 
02:51:05.570 --> 02:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
file my parents had to pay for the
 
02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
annual portraits and submitted them to
 
02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
the schools this file which no parents
 
02:51:11.870 --> 02:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
were allowed to see collected and track
 
02:51:14.030 --> 02:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
students data including but not limited
 
02:51:17.090 --> 02:51:17.100 align:start position:0%

violations punishments physical mental
 
02:51:22.910 --> 02:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
health class religion Etc these records
 
02:51:24.469 --> 02:51:24.479 align:start position:0%
were transferred to the colleges or
 
02:51:26.809 --> 02:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
employers and called Personnel files
 
02:51:29.030 --> 02:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
when we graduated from high school I was
 
02:51:30.830 --> 02:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
forbidden to see my own record and I'm
 
02:51:33.290 --> 02:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
unable to see it now in the past these
 
02:51:35.210 --> 02:51:35.220 align:start position:0%
records were kept on paper now they are
 
02:51:37.490 --> 02:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
digital what concerns me is that what I
 
02:51:40.070 --> 02:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
saw in China and why I left is also
 
02:51:42.410 --> 02:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
happening here in the United States the
 
02:51:44.090 --> 02:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
fact that I feel I must testify to
 
02:51:46.490 --> 02:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
support a parent's Rights bill is really
 
02:51:48.950 --> 02:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
rather amazing and concerning but I
 
02:51:50.809 --> 02:51:50.819 align:start position:0%
think this bill is absolutely necessary
 
02:51:52.910 --> 02:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
in today's political climate and
 
02:51:55.490 --> 02:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
tomorrow's it clarifies and protects one
 
02:51:56.990 --> 02:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
of the most ancient rights of all human
 
02:52:00.290 --> 02:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
rights parental sovereignty the deepest
 
02:52:02.090 --> 02:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
human bond is between parents and their
 
02:52:03.830 --> 02:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
children the bond between parent and
 
02:52:05.750 --> 02:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
child must be protected and not torn
 
02:52:08.510 --> 02:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
apart by any political agendas in
 
02:52:10.250 --> 02:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
America children still belong to their
 
02:52:13.070 --> 02:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
parents not to the government not to the
 
02:52:15.349 --> 02:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
institutions not any Collective groups
 
02:52:17.570 --> 02:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
parents must have the right to know what
 
02:52:19.010 --> 02:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
their children are taught in schools
 
02:52:20.809 --> 02:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
schools should not be political
 
02:52:22.910 --> 02:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
battlefields or indoctrination centers
 
02:52:25.370 --> 02:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
they should be places of Joyful learning
 
02:52:27.530 --> 02:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
focusing on academic subjects like
 
02:52:30.290 --> 02:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
Reading Writing Math and Science but not
 
02:52:32.030 --> 02:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
places of social engineering with
 
02:52:34.190 --> 02:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
divisive political agendas and age and
 
02:52:35.870 --> 02:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate content
 
02:52:38.570 --> 02:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
our kids need us more than ever they are
 
02:52:39.830 --> 02:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable innocent and
 
02:52:42.349 --> 02:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
precious human beings and need our love
 
02:52:44.510 --> 02:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
guidance and protection my parents could
 
02:52:46.849 --> 02:52:46.859 align:start position:0%
not protect me in China because they had
 
02:52:49.370 --> 02:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
no rights but this is America where
 
02:52:51.530 --> 02:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
children belong to their parents I urge
 
02:52:53.870 --> 02:52:53.880 align:start position:0%

Representatives here that spoke already
 
02:54:09.010 --> 02:54:09.020 align:start position:0%
the beautiful testimony provided by
 
02:54:11.769 --> 02:54:11.779 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond and her robust
 
02:54:16.190 --> 02:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
background in child welfare I too have
 
02:54:18.290 --> 02:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
that a similar background in that I was
 
02:54:20.090 --> 02:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
a child forensic interviewer for many
 
02:54:22.370 --> 02:54:22.380 align:start position:0%
many years interviewing nearly 2 000
 
02:54:25.550 --> 02:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
children here in our state who came to
 
02:54:28.730 --> 02:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
talk with me about abuse and or neglect
 
02:54:30.230 --> 02:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you
 
02:54:32.710 --> 02:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
with a reasonable degree of certainty
 
02:54:36.170 --> 02:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
their ability to access a safe and
 
02:54:38.269 --> 02:54:38.279 align:start position:0%
trusted adult to talk about what may
 
02:54:41.269 --> 02:54:41.279 align:start position:0%
have happened to them is Paramount in
 
02:54:43.130 --> 02:54:43.140 align:start position:0%
our ability to keep children in the
 
02:54:44.389 --> 02:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
state safe
 
02:54:47.269 --> 02:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that oftentimes they
 
02:54:49.309 --> 02:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
would go to a teacher and tell them
 
02:54:51.170 --> 02:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
something had happened when they didn't
 
02:54:53.990 --> 02:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
feel it safe or appropriate to tell a
 
02:54:56.290 --> 02:54:56.300 align:start position:0%
parent and this is not
 
02:54:59.030 --> 02:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
a testament to the child's relationship
 
02:55:01.550 --> 02:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
with the parent it's that they were able
 
02:55:03.170 --> 02:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
to access somebody that they didn't have
 
02:55:04.790 --> 02:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
the same emotional connection to
 
02:55:06.950 --> 02:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
somebody that they could go to and say
 
02:55:08.389 --> 02:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
something's going on and I need to
 
02:55:10.429 --> 02:55:10.439 align:start position:0%

importance of one trusted adult and
 
02:55:26.570 --> 02:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
that's what we're here to talk about
 
02:55:29.450 --> 02:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
today in the context of the office of
 
02:55:31.370 --> 02:55:31.380 align:start position:0%

02:55:34.490 --> 02:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
of children here in our state and so we
 
02:55:36.530 --> 02:55:36.540 align:start position:0%

02:56:02.510 --> 02:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
please support I urge you SB 272 this
 
02:56:04.849 --> 02:56:04.859 align:start position:0%
bill is about one thing and one thing
 
02:56:04.859 --> 02:56:06.170 align:start position:0%
bill is about one thing and one thing
only

02:56:06.170 --> 02:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:56:07.730 --> 02:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
the truth
 
02:56:10.809 --> 02:56:10.819 align:start position:0%
citizens will try others will try to
 
02:56:14.030 --> 02:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
convince you that 270 that SB 272
 
02:56:16.550 --> 02:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
targets certain categories of people
 
02:56:19.309 --> 02:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
that it puts children in danger and that
 
02:56:21.530 --> 02:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
parents can't quote unquote handle the
 
02:56:21.540 --> 02:56:22.550 align:start position:0%
parents can't quote unquote handle the
truth

02:56:22.550 --> 02:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
truth
 
02:56:24.650 --> 02:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
they are wrong
 
02:56:26.750 --> 02:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
the reality is that policies throughout
 
02:56:28.070 --> 02:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire require
 
02:56:30.650 --> 02:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
School Personnel to conceal information
 
02:56:33.050 --> 02:56:33.060 align:start position:0%
from parents and when directly
 
02:56:35.210 --> 02:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
questioned lie
 
02:56:37.010 --> 02:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
this is unconscionable
 
02:56:39.590 --> 02:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
and it must be stopped
 
02:56:41.090 --> 02:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
what our elementary school age children
 
02:56:43.790 --> 02:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
first and third grade we're at SAU 70 in
 
02:56:46.550 --> 02:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
Hanover I'm also a 1991 grad
 
02:56:48.170 --> 02:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
there were concerted efforts by school
 
02:56:50.510 --> 02:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
Personnel to conceal and exclude parents
 
02:56:52.429 --> 02:56:52.439 align:start position:0%
from accessing information highly
 
02:56:53.809 --> 02:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
relevant to the education of our
 
02:56:55.790 --> 02:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
children especially surrounding topics
 
02:56:58.250 --> 02:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
of sex gender and race
 
02:57:00.469 --> 02:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
our new associate principal Nan Parsons
 
02:57:02.210 --> 02:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
broadcasted the community that she was
 
02:57:03.469 --> 02:57:03.479 align:start position:0%
going to have quote unquote difficult
 
02:57:05.929 --> 02:57:05.939 align:start position:0%
conversations with our children lead a
 
02:57:08.690 --> 02:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
social transformation of the school and
 
02:57:10.730 --> 02:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
form a book group that compared the U.S
 
02:57:13.130 --> 02:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
to Nazi Germany when I asked what she
 
02:57:15.650 --> 02:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
meant by this she refused to answer on
 
02:57:17.750 --> 02:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
our exchange ended with the
 
02:57:20.450 --> 02:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
superintendent accusing me of borderline
 
02:57:22.550 --> 02:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
harassment simply for wanting to know
 
02:57:25.309 --> 02:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
what was going to be taught to my kids
 
02:57:28.429 --> 02:57:28.439 align:start position:0%
at no time was I in civil or
 
02:57:28.439 --> 02:57:29.929 align:start position:0%
at no time was I in civil or
disrespectful

02:57:29.929 --> 02:57:29.939 align:start position:0%
disrespectful
 
02:57:32.330 --> 02:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
to this day no parent knows what changes
 
02:57:33.710 --> 02:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
are being implemented in the school
 
02:57:36.769 --> 02:57:36.779 align:start position:0%
curriculum and what leadership plans
 
02:57:39.469 --> 02:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
because they will not tell us
 
02:57:41.090 --> 02:57:41.100 align:start position:0%
recently friends reported that their
 
02:57:43.550 --> 02:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
kindergarten was being told to draw
 
02:57:46.190 --> 02:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
himself like when he got out of the
 
02:57:48.889 --> 02:57:48.899 align:start position:0%
tubby or out of the shower with a
 
02:57:51.469 --> 02:57:51.479 align:start position:0%
specific and explicit focus on drawing
 
02:57:54.950 --> 02:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:56.630 --> 02:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
I also resubmitted a letter to this
 
02:57:59.210 --> 02:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
committee detailing the pornographic
 
02:58:01.250 --> 02:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
material in the school libraries which
 
02:58:03.530 --> 02:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
is being actively promoted to students
 
02:58:06.050 --> 02:58:06.060 align:start position:0%
but is hidden from parents because it is
 
02:58:07.610 --> 02:58:07.620 align:start position:0%
not included
 
02:58:09.769 --> 02:58:09.779 align:start position:0%
in the card catalogs accessible to
 
02:58:12.530 --> 02:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
parents for review the graphic images of
 
02:58:14.990 --> 02:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
young boys fellating each other young
 
02:58:16.670 --> 02:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
girls tasting each other's vaginal
 
02:58:19.370 --> 02:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
juices boys engaging in Circle Jerks
 
02:58:21.469 --> 02:58:21.479 align:start position:0%
before being forced to drink cups of
 
02:58:25.130 --> 02:58:25.140 align:start position:0%
semen is unacceptable
 
02:58:27.769 --> 02:58:27.779 align:start position:0%
if you don't think this is happening
 
02:58:30.710 --> 02:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
I can assure you that it is I have
 
02:58:32.630 --> 02:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
pictures of the entrance table of our
 
02:58:34.790 --> 02:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
Middle School library where these books
 
02:58:36.230 --> 02:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
are displayed
 
02:58:38.510 --> 02:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
and promoted
 
02:58:40.550 --> 02:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
there is also a school policy jbab which
 
02:58:42.230 --> 02:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned previously
 
02:58:43.910 --> 02:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
which instructs school officials to
 
02:58:45.410 --> 02:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
conceal information regarding gender
 
02:58:47.929 --> 02:58:47.939 align:start position:0%
issues from parents and to lie to them
 
02:58:49.849 --> 02:58:49.859 align:start position:0%
if directly questioned as you can
 
02:58:52.070 --> 02:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
imagine we are completely we completely
 
02:58:54.290 --> 02:58:54.300 align:start position:0%
disagree with any policy instructing
 
02:58:57.050 --> 02:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
School Personnel to lie to parents there
 
02:58:58.490 --> 02:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
are dozens of lawsuits occurring around
 
02:59:00.530 --> 02:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
the country including in Manchester New
 
02:59:02.330 --> 02:59:02.340 align:start position:0%

02:59:13.070 --> 02:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
I urge you please to support SB 272 let
 
02:59:15.349 --> 02:59:15.359 align:start position:0%

political Refugee almost 30 years ago I

am here to represent the New Hampshire
 
03:00:49.730 --> 03:00:49.740 align:start position:0%
Asian American coalition to support SB
 
03:00:53.389 --> 03:00:53.399 align:start position:0%
272 the parent parental Bill of Rights
 
03:00:55.490 --> 03:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
in education
 
03:01:00.889 --> 03:01:00.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:03.490 --> 03:01:03.500 align:start position:0%
is a Civic and social organization
 
03:01:06.110 --> 03:01:06.120 align:start position:0%

largest minority group in New Hampshire
 
03:01:15.050 --> 03:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
with the three percent of the population
 
03:01:18.410 --> 03:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
and four percent after the Hispanic our
 
03:01:20.809 --> 03:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
group has many members who are
 
03:01:24.410 --> 03:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
immigrants who fled totalitarian regimes
 
03:01:26.929 --> 03:01:26.939 align:start position:0%
like China and Vietnam we came here
 
03:01:29.570 --> 03:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
because we believe that America is the
 
03:01:32.389 --> 03:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
land of the free and Home of the Brave
 
03:01:35.330 --> 03:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
where we came from the parental rights
 
03:01:39.469 --> 03:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
do not exist nor are they protected all
 
03:01:42.110 --> 03:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
the oppressive regimes believe and act
 
03:01:45.230 --> 03:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
as if all children belong to the state
 
03:01:48.349 --> 03:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
not the parents and treat them as
 
03:01:50.210 --> 03:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
birthing machines
 
03:01:53.330 --> 03:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
therefore parents have no say about
 
03:01:56.210 --> 03:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
their kids education and they don't have
 
03:01:58.429 --> 03:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
the right to access their kids personal
 
03:01:58.439 --> 03:01:59.769 align:start position:0%
the right to access their kids personal
data

03:01:59.769 --> 03:01:59.779 align:start position:0%
data
 
03:02:03.050 --> 03:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
Communists always indoctrinate kids and
 
03:02:06.290 --> 03:02:06.300 align:start position:0%
turn children against their parents
 
03:02:09.710 --> 03:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
if parents dare to correct their kids of
 
03:02:12.590 --> 03:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
what state teaching is wrong then they
 
03:02:14.570 --> 03:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
can be arrested and thrown in prison
 
03:02:17.929 --> 03:02:17.939 align:start position:0%
without any due process
 
03:02:20.750 --> 03:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
We Believe parental rights are the
 
03:02:23.990 --> 03:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
fundamental human rights and they must
 
03:02:25.550 --> 03:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
be protected
 
03:02:28.910 --> 03:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
parents have the right to know what is
 
03:02:31.910 --> 03:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
taught in schools ask questions and
 
03:02:35.030 --> 03:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
inspect school materials parents have
 
03:02:37.910 --> 03:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
the right to access and review school
 
03:02:40.849 --> 03:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
records timely and attend the children's
 
03:02:43.490 --> 03:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
class as Observers
 
03:02:46.309 --> 03:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
parents have the right to make all the
 
03:02:49.490 --> 03:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
medical decisions for their children one
 
03:02:52.550 --> 03:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
quick example I used to be vaccinated
 
03:02:56.450 --> 03:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
many times on both of my shoulders with
 
03:02:58.730 --> 03:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
shots that I didn't even know what they
 
03:02:58.740 --> 03:02:59.630 align:start position:0%
shots that I didn't even know what they
were

03:02:59.630 --> 03:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:03:02.870 --> 03:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
my parents were not aware of any of
 
03:03:05.870 --> 03:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
these events and never mind about giving
 
03:03:10.330 --> 03:03:10.340 align:start position:0%
consent there is no such a concept about
 
03:03:13.750 --> 03:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
parental consent in Vietnam
 
03:03:17.150 --> 03:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
nurses just showed up in our school and
 
03:03:19.309 --> 03:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
all the kids have to line up to get shot
 
03:03:22.370 --> 03:03:22.380 align:start position:0%
with thou disposable needles
 
03:03:25.790 --> 03:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
so nurses use the same needle for all
 
03:03:25.800 --> 03:03:26.690 align:start position:0%
so nurses use the same needle for all
kids

03:03:26.690 --> 03:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
kids
 
03:03:30.590 --> 03:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
only God knows what kind of disease was
 
03:03:32.929 --> 03:03:32.939 align:start position:0%
transmitted via those needs no you're at
 
03:03:34.610 --> 03:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
the end of your time right now oh sorry
 
03:03:37.190 --> 03:03:37.200 align:start position:0%

really appreciate it thank you
 
03:03:45.830 --> 03:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Quincy I'm sorry I was just in
 
03:03:47.809 --> 03:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
the hallway when I was called what is
 
03:03:49.910 --> 03:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
your name again Quincy from Dover okay
 
03:03:52.790 --> 03:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
Quincy from Dover go ahead hi
 
03:03:55.309 --> 03:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
um hello Quincy pronounce she her hers
 
03:03:56.690 --> 03:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
from Dover
 
03:04:00.170 --> 03:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to testify against SB 272
 
03:04:02.929 --> 03:04:02.939 align:start position:0%
again because of its blatant homophobic
 
03:04:04.910 --> 03:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
and transphobic nature
 
03:04:06.410 --> 03:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
in addition to being an overall
 
03:04:08.690 --> 03:04:08.700 align:start position:0%
ridiculous attempt to undermine teachers
 
03:04:10.250 --> 03:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
ability to teach and support their
 
03:04:10.260 --> 03:04:11.269 align:start position:0%
ability to teach and support their
students

03:04:11.269 --> 03:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:04:13.429 --> 03:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
I'm queer took me a lot of years to
 
03:04:14.630 --> 03:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
figure that out
 
03:04:16.309 --> 03:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
it was something I was always passionate
 
03:04:18.590 --> 03:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
about even before I identified that way
 
03:04:20.929 --> 03:04:20.939 align:start position:0%
queer and trans rights so there were
 
03:04:24.110 --> 03:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
rumors flying around school about me
 
03:04:26.929 --> 03:04:26.939 align:start position:0%
being gay since I was in Middle School
 
03:04:28.610 --> 03:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
um including you know teachers
 
03:04:31.370 --> 03:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
questioning and wondering that
 
03:04:31.380 --> 03:04:32.210 align:start position:0%
questioning and wondering that
um

03:04:32.210 --> 03:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:33.889 --> 03:04:33.899 align:start position:0%
it would have really been detrimental to
 
03:04:35.809 --> 03:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
my mental health if that information was
 
03:04:38.630 --> 03:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
shared with my parents before I felt
 
03:04:40.969 --> 03:04:40.979 align:start position:0%
comfortable talking to them
 
03:04:42.349 --> 03:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
um I am lucky to have more Super
 
03:04:45.469 --> 03:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
supportive parents than most but I
 
03:04:47.030 --> 03:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to be really sure because you
 
03:04:49.070 --> 03:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
know kids are figuring themselves out in
 
03:04:51.889 --> 03:04:51.899 align:start position:0%
many many ways and I think it's kind of
 
03:04:53.990 --> 03:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
jumping the gun a little bit to have to
 
03:04:56.269 --> 03:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
report on every single thing that
 
03:04:57.950 --> 03:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
children are figuring out to their
 
03:04:57.960 --> 03:04:59.450 align:start position:0%
children are figuring out to their
parents

03:04:59.450 --> 03:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
parents
 
03:04:59.460 --> 03:05:00.650 align:start position:0%
parents
um

03:05:00.650 --> 03:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:02.809 --> 03:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
coming out is a big deal you know no
 
03:05:03.950 --> 03:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
matter what
 
03:05:06.469 --> 03:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
um so outing students is harmful I want
 
03:05:07.670 --> 03:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
to be clear we've heard a lot of talk
 
03:05:10.670 --> 03:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
today about hard conversations we are
 
03:05:12.410 --> 03:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
talking about the potential for violence
 
03:05:14.870 --> 03:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
and abuse I know there are laws around
 
03:05:17.150 --> 03:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
it we know that still does not prevent
 
03:05:19.490 --> 03:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
all children from being abused by their
 
03:05:21.590 --> 03:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
parents especially the rates at which
 
03:05:23.290 --> 03:05:23.300 align:start position:0%
queer and trans youth
 
03:05:25.429 --> 03:05:25.439 align:start position:0%
experience that
 
03:05:26.809 --> 03:05:26.819 align:start position:0%
um I talked to my parents when I was
 
03:05:29.690 --> 03:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
ready in college on my own terms and I'm
 
03:05:31.730 --> 03:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
really grateful for that
 
03:05:33.469 --> 03:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
um I think of my younger siblings still
 
03:05:35.809 --> 03:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
going through the school system here and
 
03:05:37.790 --> 03:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
how I want them to have the freedom to
 
03:05:39.349 --> 03:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
figure themselves out
 
03:05:41.929 --> 03:05:41.939 align:start position:0%
I would also add if you have a good
 
03:05:43.910 --> 03:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
relationship with your child if you
 
03:05:45.530 --> 03:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that you are supportive
 
03:05:48.290 --> 03:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
loving and non-judgmental you wouldn't
 
03:05:50.450 --> 03:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
need to force teachers to report on your
 
03:05:52.610 --> 03:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
child's every move to you
 
03:05:55.190 --> 03:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
teachers support students not
 
03:05:56.870 --> 03:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
indoctrinate them
 
03:05:58.969 --> 03:05:58.979 align:start position:0%
teachers support students often even
 
03:06:01.610 --> 03:06:01.620 align:start position:0%
when their parents don't so I ask you to
 
03:06:03.650 --> 03:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
please not take that support away and to
 
03:06:06.710 --> 03:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
vote itl on this Bill thank you thank
 
03:06:07.969 --> 03:06:07.979 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
03:06:11.690 --> 03:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
the next two speakers are going to be uh
 
03:06:16.190 --> 03:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
viriana Mullen followed by Laura speak
 
03:06:19.610 --> 03:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
and Laura will need a chair
 
03:06:29.030 --> 03:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:31.550 --> 03:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
until we get the chair there's the chair
 
03:06:31.560 --> 03:06:38.630 align:start position:0%
until we get the chair there's the chair
okay

03:06:38.630 --> 03:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:40.730 --> 03:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
mostly the chair is there so that if my
 
03:06:42.650 --> 03:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
chronic dizziness um
 
03:06:44.389 --> 03:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
kicks in I have somewhere to sit that's
 
03:06:46.429 --> 03:06:46.439 align:start position:0%
not the floor
 
03:06:46.439 --> 03:06:47.090 align:start position:0%
not the floor
um

03:06:47.090 --> 03:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:48.950 --> 03:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Laura speak I live in
 
03:06:51.769 --> 03:06:51.779 align:start position:0%
Windham I grew up in Meredith I went to
 
03:06:53.450 --> 03:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
the same high school that my mother and
 
03:06:55.849 --> 03:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
my grandfather did
 
03:06:59.750 --> 03:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
I am in fact a fourth generation local
 
03:06:59.760 --> 03:07:00.590 align:start position:0%
I am in fact a fourth generation local
um

03:07:00.590 --> 03:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:02.570 --> 03:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
I submitted
 
03:07:05.389 --> 03:07:05.399 align:start position:0%
quite a lengthy written testimony last
 
03:07:05.399 --> 03:07:06.889 align:start position:0%
quite a lengthy written testimony last
night

03:07:06.889 --> 03:07:06.899 align:start position:0%
night
 
03:07:08.690 --> 03:07:08.700 align:start position:0%
um technically this morning
 
03:07:12.050 --> 03:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
but what I want to read aloud today are
 
03:07:13.790 --> 03:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
the words of
 
03:07:16.429 --> 03:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
a transgender child who cannot be here
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
today because in 2014
 
03:07:21.410 --> 03:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
she looked at her life decided it wasn't
 
03:07:29.269 --> 03:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:30.530 --> 03:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try to get through it
 
03:07:32.150 --> 03:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
without crying I am sorry for how
 
03:07:33.889 --> 03:07:33.899 align:start position:0%
triggering this content is but it is
 
03:07:36.889 --> 03:07:36.899 align:start position:0%
important that you hear the words of the
 
03:07:40.370 --> 03:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
people that this law would affect and
 
03:07:40.380 --> 03:07:42.769 align:start position:0%
people that this law would affect and
hurt

03:07:42.769 --> 03:07:42.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:45.469 --> 03:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
if you are reading this it means that I
 
03:07:47.150 --> 03:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
have committed suicide and obviously
 
03:07:49.910 --> 03:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
failed to delete this post from my cue
 
03:07:53.269 --> 03:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
please don't be sad it's for the better
 
03:07:54.769 --> 03:07:54.779 align:start position:0%
the life I would have lived isn't worth
 
03:07:57.830 --> 03:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
living in because I'm transgender
 
03:07:59.990 --> 03:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
I could go into detail explaining why I
 
03:08:01.730 --> 03:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
feel that way but this note is probably
 
03:08:04.010 --> 03:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
going to be lengthy as it is
 
03:08:05.750 --> 03:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
to put it simply I feel like a girl
 
03:08:07.550 --> 03:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
trapped in a boy's body and I felt that
 
03:08:09.469 --> 03:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
way ever since I was four
 
03:08:10.849 --> 03:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
I never knew there was a word for that
 
03:08:13.309 --> 03:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
feeling nor was it possible for a boy to
 
03:08:14.330 --> 03:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
become a girl
 
03:08:16.250 --> 03:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
so I never told anyone and just
 
03:08:17.870 --> 03:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
continued to do traditionally boyish
 
03:08:20.030 --> 03:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
things to try to fit in
 
03:08:22.790 --> 03:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
when I was 14 I learned what transgender
 
03:08:24.769 --> 03:08:24.779 align:start position:0%
meant and cried of happiness
 
03:08:26.690 --> 03:08:26.700 align:start position:0%
after 10 years of confusion I finally
 
03:08:28.370 --> 03:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
understood who I was
 
03:08:30.290 --> 03:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
I immediately told my mom and she
 
03:08:32.210 --> 03:08:32.220 align:start position:0%
reacted extremely negatively telling me
 
03:08:33.889 --> 03:08:33.899 align:start position:0%
that it was a phase that I would never
 
03:08:36.050 --> 03:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
truly be a girl that God doesn't make
 
03:08:38.690 --> 03:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
mistakes that I am wrong
 
03:08:41.570 --> 03:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
if you are reading this parents please
 
03:08:43.550 --> 03:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
don't tell this to your kids even if you
 
03:08:45.290 --> 03:08:45.300 align:start position:0%
are Christian or against transgender
 
03:08:47.570 --> 03:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
people don't ever say that to someone
 
03:08:49.730 --> 03:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
especially your kid that won't do
 
03:08:51.410 --> 03:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
anything but make them hate themselves
 
03:08:54.230 --> 03:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what it did to me
 
03:08:56.210 --> 03:08:56.220 align:start position:0%
my mom started taking me to a therapist
 
03:08:57.769 --> 03:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
but would only take me to Christian
 
03:09:00.290 --> 03:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
therapists so I never actually got the
 
03:09:01.849 --> 03:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
therapy I needed to cure me of my
 
03:09:01.859 --> 03:09:03.050 align:start position:0%
therapy I needed to cure me of my
depression

03:09:03.050 --> 03:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
depression
 
03:09:04.730 --> 03:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
I only got more Christians telling me
 
03:09:06.590 --> 03:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
that I was selfish and wrong and that I
 
03:09:08.750 --> 03:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
should look to God for help
 
03:09:10.730 --> 03:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
when I was 16 I realized that my parents
 
03:09:12.349 --> 03:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
would never come around and that I would
 
03:09:14.269 --> 03:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
have to wait until I was 18 to start any
 
03:09:16.190 --> 03:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
sort of transitioning treatment
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
which absolutely broke my heart
 
03:09:20.809 --> 03:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
the longer you wait the harder it is to
 
03:09:22.910 --> 03:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
transition I felt hopeless that I was
 
03:09:24.349 --> 03:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
just going to look like a man in drag
 
03:09:26.150 --> 03:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
for the rest of my life
 
03:09:28.010 --> 03:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
on my 16th birthday when I didn't
 
03:09:30.410 --> 03:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
receive consent from my parents
 
03:09:32.990 --> 03:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
to start transitioning I cried myself to
 
03:09:35.809 --> 03:09:35.819 align:start position:0%
sleep I formed a sort of Fu attitude
 
03:09:37.429 --> 03:09:37.439 align:start position:0%
towards my parents and came out as gay
 
03:09:39.830 --> 03:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
at school thinking that maybe if I eased
 
03:09:41.090 --> 03:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
into coming out as trans it would be
 
03:09:42.410 --> 03:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
less of a shock
 
03:09:44.150 --> 03:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
although the reaction for my friends was
 
03:09:46.429 --> 03:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
positive my parents were pissed they
 
03:09:47.990 --> 03:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
felt like I was attacking their image
 
03:09:50.809 --> 03:09:50.819 align:start position:0%
and that I was an embarrassment to them
 
03:09:52.190 --> 03:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
they wanted me to be their perfect
 
03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
little straight Christian boy your time
 
03:09:56.809 --> 03:09:56.819 align:start position:0%
is up okay
 
03:09:58.790 --> 03:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
her name was Leela Alcorn and I
 
03:10:01.070 --> 03:10:01.080 align:start position:0%

this is not my first time testifying
 
03:10:45.290 --> 03:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
before the New Hampshire House of
 
03:10:47.570 --> 03:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
Representatives my first experience was
 
03:10:50.750 --> 03:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 as a 14 year old freshman
 
03:10:56.330 --> 03:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:58.910 --> 03:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
and support of Bill 263 a
 
03:11:00.950 --> 03:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination bill for K-12
 
03:11:03.050 --> 03:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
students that included protections on
 
03:11:05.210 --> 03:11:05.220 align:start position:0%
the basis of gender identity
 
03:11:06.710 --> 03:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of my high school
 
03:11:06.720 --> 03:11:09.349 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of my high school
experience

03:11:09.349 --> 03:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
experience
 
03:11:11.210 --> 03:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
and coming out as transgender I've had
 
03:11:13.550 --> 03:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
to defend my right to be safe and
 
03:11:16.670 --> 03:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
respected as a student for myself for my
 
03:11:18.710 --> 03:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
friends and for my peers across the
 
03:11:18.720 --> 03:11:20.150 align:start position:0%

state
 
03:11:22.730 --> 03:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
five years later I'm here to protect the
 
03:11:24.590 --> 03:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
Youth of my community that are somehow
 
03:11:26.570 --> 03:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
stuck in the same position
 
03:11:28.790 --> 03:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
I'll be supporting them today by sharing
 
03:11:31.010 --> 03:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
my experience they could not exist in a
 
03:11:34.070 --> 03:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
future with this legislation
 
03:11:35.809 --> 03:11:35.819 align:start position:0%
from as early as the first grade I
 
03:11:37.429 --> 03:11:37.439 align:start position:0%
expressed feelings of queerness and
 
03:11:39.349 --> 03:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
gender non-conformity
 
03:11:40.969 --> 03:11:40.979 align:start position:0%
despite many efforts of trying to
 
03:11:43.250 --> 03:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
express this feeling my mother told me
 
03:11:44.990 --> 03:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
not to express these feelings in public
 
03:11:47.030 --> 03:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
or at school out of concern for my
 
03:11:47.040 --> 03:11:48.349 align:start position:0%
or at school out of concern for my
safety

03:11:48.349 --> 03:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
safety
 
03:11:50.389 --> 03:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
the summer before my freshman year of
 
03:11:52.849 --> 03:11:52.859 align:start position:0%
high school I decided if I wasn't given
 
03:11:55.070 --> 03:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
permission and support to be myself I
 
03:11:56.330 --> 03:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
would have to take the steps to be
 
03:11:58.730 --> 03:11:58.740 align:start position:0%
authentically me on my own
 
03:12:01.010 --> 03:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
I knew going from my small Middle School
 
03:12:02.990 --> 03:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
of Waterville Valley to the larger
 
03:12:04.910 --> 03:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
Regional High School of Plymouth New
 
03:12:06.469 --> 03:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I had a clean slate to
 
03:12:08.090 --> 03:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
introduce my true self
 
03:12:09.889 --> 03:12:09.899 align:start position:0%
I emailed my teachers ahead of time
 
03:12:12.110 --> 03:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
asking them to use my preferred name and
 
03:12:13.670 --> 03:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
pronouns and let them know I read the
 
03:12:13.680 --> 03:12:15.170 align:start position:0%
pronouns and let them know I read the
syllabus

03:12:15.170 --> 03:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
syllabus
 
03:12:17.929 --> 03:12:17.939 align:start position:0%
it was not until open house night that
 
03:12:19.730 --> 03:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
my mother found out I was going by these
 
03:12:21.469 --> 03:12:21.479 align:start position:0%
different name and pronouns
 
03:12:23.090 --> 03:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
she greatly resisted the social
 
03:12:25.190 --> 03:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
transition but it was the time that I
 
03:12:27.050 --> 03:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
had come out in school felt the support
 
03:12:29.150 --> 03:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
of my teachers and my friends and the
 
03:12:31.309 --> 03:12:31.319 align:start position:0%
joy of being my true self that gave me
 
03:12:33.950 --> 03:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
the strength to resist back and express
 
03:12:37.250 --> 03:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:39.410 --> 03:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
within a year of being myself my mother
 
03:12:42.110 --> 03:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
began to learn understand and support my
 
03:12:44.570 --> 03:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
identity for which I am lucky as a
 
03:12:46.849 --> 03:12:46.859 align:start position:0%
parent she was finally given the right
 
03:12:49.490 --> 03:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
and ability and opportunity to meet the
 
03:12:51.590 --> 03:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
adult I was becoming and my coming out
 
03:12:53.809 --> 03:12:53.819 align:start position:0%
is the reason we still have a loving
 
03:12:57.050 --> 03:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
strong relationship today
 
03:12:59.450 --> 03:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
if we are to allow young adults to sign
 
03:13:01.990 --> 03:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
up for classes get a license to drive
 
03:13:04.849 --> 03:13:04.859 align:start position:0%
influence medical decisions apply for
 
03:13:07.130 --> 03:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
college and ultimately make choices that
 
03:13:09.050 --> 03:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
will affect their career an entire
 
03:13:11.090 --> 03:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
future trajectory then we must allow
 
03:13:12.769 --> 03:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
them to make decisions about how they
 
03:13:14.450 --> 03:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
are dressed and feel most authentic
 
03:13:16.610 --> 03:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
03:13:17.690 --> 03:13:17.700 align:start position:0%

hi Allison Dyer Nashua New Hampshire I
 
03:13:55.010 --> 03:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
submitted a length year testimony but
 
03:13:57.110 --> 03:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'll just read a portion
 
03:13:59.690 --> 03:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
so I as well as many parents have stood
 
03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
for our local school boards and state
 
03:14:04.309 --> 03:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
legislators across the state to claim
 
03:14:07.309 --> 03:14:07.319 align:start position:0%
the right parents rights we have been
 
03:14:07.319 --> 03:14:08.210 align:start position:0%
the right parents rights we have been
met

03:14:08.210 --> 03:14:08.220 align:start position:0%
met
 
03:14:10.010 --> 03:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
by government officials who declare
 
03:14:11.570 --> 03:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
themselves the
 
03:14:13.790 --> 03:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
ultimate determiners of what is best for
 
03:14:15.349 --> 03:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
our children are told the rights that
 
03:14:17.210 --> 03:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
we've stated that we thought were
 
03:14:19.730 --> 03:14:19.740 align:start position:0%
enshrined by such things as the 14th
 
03:14:22.429 --> 03:14:22.439 align:start position:0%
amendment that they don't apply in this
 
03:14:25.550 --> 03:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
instance or the coverall word and
 
03:14:27.650 --> 03:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
education FERPA
 
03:14:29.210 --> 03:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
forgetting there is a difference between
 
03:14:32.389 --> 03:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
privacy and secrecy this includes
 
03:14:34.130 --> 03:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
growing instances of schools actively
 
03:14:36.769 --> 03:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
hiding curricula or critical information
 
03:14:38.870 --> 03:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
about our children's mental physical
 
03:14:41.570 --> 03:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
health from parents a Time old adage
 
03:14:43.730 --> 03:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
Still Remains
 
03:14:45.530 --> 03:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
safe adults don't ask children to keep
 
03:14:45.540 --> 03:14:46.790 align:start position:0%
safe adults don't ask children to keep
secrets

03:14:46.790 --> 03:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
secrets
 
03:14:48.830 --> 03:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
why would our taxpayer-funded education
 
03:14:50.750 --> 03:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
system want to keep secrets from parents
 
03:14:52.130 --> 03:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
in communities in which they live and
 
03:14:52.140 --> 03:14:53.030 align:start position:0%
in communities in which they live and
work

03:14:53.030 --> 03:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:14:54.889 --> 03:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
the simple fact that the pressure of
 
03:14:56.870 --> 03:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
keeping a secret can prevent a child
 
03:14:58.730 --> 03:14:58.740 align:start position:0%
from telling someone something important
 
03:15:00.590 --> 03:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
or it can get in the way of keeping them
 
03:15:03.110 --> 03:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
safe or it can cause hesitation when
 
03:15:04.610 --> 03:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
asking for help
 
03:15:06.349 --> 03:15:06.359 align:start position:0%
feel like that's the pause that
 
03:15:08.990 --> 03:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
opponents of this bill need please also
 
03:15:10.490 --> 03:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
remember that it's natural for children
 
03:15:12.889 --> 03:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
to worry about their parents in
 
03:15:14.809 --> 03:15:14.819 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable situations with some of
 
03:15:16.969 --> 03:15:16.979 align:start position:0%
their social ideological or identity
 
03:15:19.309 --> 03:15:19.319 align:start position:0%
issues but their discomfort is never
 
03:15:21.230 --> 03:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
dissuaded our schools from informing
 
03:15:23.750 --> 03:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
parents of things like declining grades
 
03:15:27.170 --> 03:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
absenteeism conduct problems and all of
 
03:15:28.490 --> 03:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
these cases our schools know that
 
03:15:30.230 --> 03:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
parents are best equipped to manage and
 
03:15:31.790 --> 03:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
support their children
 
03:15:34.610 --> 03:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
so please support SB 272 so we can all
 
03:15:36.830 --> 03:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
unite around protecting all children and
 
03:15:38.870 --> 03:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
uphold common decency standards in our
 
03:15:40.610 --> 03:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
Public School environments thank you
 
03:15:42.170 --> 03:15:42.180 align:start position:0%

03:15:59.750 --> 03:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
we've heard that SB 272 does have an
 
03:16:01.910 --> 03:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
exemption against teachers forcibly
 
03:16:06.769 --> 03:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
outing a student in the case of abuse
 
03:16:09.550 --> 03:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
I want to speak to how difficult it is
 
03:16:13.370 --> 03:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
to know if outing a student a minor
 
03:16:15.769 --> 03:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
student will put that child's mental
 
03:16:19.969 --> 03:16:19.979 align:start position:0%
health and possibly their life in danger
 
03:16:22.550 --> 03:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
let me tell you my family's story
 
03:16:24.650 --> 03:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
my eldest child
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
in high school was starting to learn
 
03:16:31.730 --> 03:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
about her sexual
 
03:16:33.889 --> 03:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
and gender identity
 
03:16:39.349 --> 03:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
she first thought she might be bisexual
 
03:16:44.110 --> 03:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
she came later to feel that they were
 
03:16:47.510 --> 03:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
non-binary or genderqueer
 
03:16:51.050 --> 03:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
and the final realization was that he
 
03:16:53.769 --> 03:16:53.779 align:start position:0%
was trans male
 
03:16:58.130 --> 03:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
my son had every reason to believe that
 
03:17:00.530 --> 03:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
with two very loving parents he would be
 
03:17:03.170 --> 03:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
accepted in Love no matter what
 
03:17:07.309 --> 03:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
my son knew that I was very supportive
 
03:17:10.550 --> 03:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
of gay and lesbian rights
 
03:17:14.150 --> 03:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
but my son intuited correctly that I
 
03:17:17.090 --> 03:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
really didn't understand about trans
 
03:17:19.190 --> 03:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
and it was another year or two before I
 
03:17:21.530 --> 03:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
learned about that
 
03:17:24.769 --> 03:17:24.779 align:start position:0%
when my son felt I was ready he came out
 
03:17:27.410 --> 03:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
to me when he no longer had to fear
 
03:17:30.590 --> 03:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
being rejected which can cause a child
 
03:17:32.690 --> 03:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
when rejected by the most important
 
03:17:34.610 --> 03:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
people in lives to become depressed
 
03:17:37.370 --> 03:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
potentially suicidal
 
03:17:39.590 --> 03:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
at the time my son was not ready to come
 
03:17:43.070 --> 03:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
out to my husband his father
 
03:17:44.870 --> 03:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
03:17:48.230 --> 03:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
my husband Wayne the father
 
03:17:51.290 --> 03:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
was dealing with terminal cancer with
 
03:17:53.929 --> 03:17:53.939 align:start position:0%
only two to five years given to live and
 
03:17:56.929 --> 03:17:56.939 align:start position:0%
no possibility of cure
 
03:18:00.230 --> 03:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
my son believed and I think rightly that
 
03:18:02.030 --> 03:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
I know my husband would have eventually
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
accepted and loved my son our son
 
03:18:08.030 --> 03:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
but he would probably have
 
03:18:10.610 --> 03:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
a year or two of coming to trying to
 
03:18:12.590 --> 03:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
come to terms with it and be fully
 
03:18:12.600 --> 03:18:13.849 align:start position:0%
come to terms with it and be fully
accepting

03:18:13.849 --> 03:18:13.859 align:start position:0%
accepting
 
03:18:16.910 --> 03:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
as many of you know stress when dealing
 
03:18:19.070 --> 03:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
with a serious health condition can
 
03:18:22.730 --> 03:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:25.309 --> 03:18:25.319 align:start position:0%
for my son to come out to his father my
 
03:18:29.389 --> 03:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
husband during this cancer Journey
 
03:18:32.630 --> 03:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
and then to possibly see the cancer
 
03:18:35.150 --> 03:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
symptoms worsen and death come more
 
03:18:35.160 --> 03:18:36.230 align:start position:0%
symptoms worsen and death come more
quickly

03:18:36.230 --> 03:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
03:18:38.269 --> 03:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
would have been devastating to my son to
 
03:18:40.370 --> 03:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
think he might have hastened that death
 
03:18:42.230 --> 03:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
would have put my son into depression
 
03:18:44.990 --> 03:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
and possibly led to Suicide over
 
03:18:47.929 --> 03:18:47.939 align:start position:0%
feelings of guilt so my son chose not to
 
03:18:52.130 --> 03:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
come out to his father my husband
 
03:18:55.610 --> 03:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
teachers cannot possibly know all these
 
03:18:55.620 --> 03:18:57.469 align:start position:0%
teachers cannot possibly know all these
circumstances

03:18:57.469 --> 03:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
03:18:59.870 --> 03:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
that a minor student has to consider
 
03:19:02.030 --> 03:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
when deciding if and when to come out to
 
03:19:04.969 --> 03:19:04.979 align:start position:0%
their parents your time has run out so
 
03:19:08.150 --> 03:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
let me ask legislators to please trust
 
03:19:10.429 --> 03:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
that the child knows best the right time
 
03:19:13.550 --> 03:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
to come out respect that and please
 
03:19:18.530 --> 03:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
oppose SB 272. thank you is Beth scare
 
03:19:25.550 --> 03:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:27.830 --> 03:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony my
 
03:19:29.750 --> 03:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
name is Beth scare and I'm a mother from
 
03:19:33.830 --> 03:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
Nashua and first I want to say that none
 
03:19:37.670 --> 03:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
of nothing in this bill forces teachers
 
03:19:40.130 --> 03:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
to spontaneously come out with
 
03:19:42.110 --> 03:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
information to parents
 
03:19:46.010 --> 03:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
it says that if the parents ask the
 
03:19:48.110 --> 03:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
teachers have to tell the truth about
 
03:19:50.809 --> 03:19:50.819 align:start position:0%
pronouns gender and
 
03:19:53.630 --> 03:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
name changes
 
03:19:57.889 --> 03:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:00.530 --> 03:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
that's why I have a backup okay
 
03:20:04.849 --> 03:20:04.859 align:start position:0%
in 2017 Bruce Lent taught a social study
 
03:20:07.370 --> 03:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
teacher at National High an advisor to
 
03:20:09.590 --> 03:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
the school's gay straight Alliance Club
 
03:20:11.450 --> 03:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
was arrested for sending nude pictures
 
03:20:14.450 --> 03:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
of himself to several male students and
 
03:20:16.010 --> 03:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
engaging in sexually explicit
 
03:20:18.650 --> 03:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
conversations with them and soliciting
 
03:20:20.450 --> 03:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
the students to send them nude photos of
 
03:20:20.460 --> 03:20:21.530 align:start position:0%
the students to send them nude photos of
themselves

03:20:21.530 --> 03:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
03:20:23.690 --> 03:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
he also solicited them to meet with him
 
03:20:25.550 --> 03:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
to engage in sex
 
03:20:28.610 --> 03:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
in 2021 popular Concord High School
 
03:20:31.550 --> 03:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
teacher Joshua Harwood was arrested on
 
03:20:33.410 --> 03:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
child sex abuse image charges
 
03:20:36.050 --> 03:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
prostitution and endangering the welfare
 
03:20:39.050 --> 03:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
of a child like Bruce langtott he was
 
03:20:42.110 --> 03:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
soliciting sex with male students he had
 
03:20:45.290 --> 03:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
formally taught in Nashua as well
 
03:20:47.570 --> 03:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
teachers sexually abusing students is
 
03:20:50.750 --> 03:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
not uncommon these teachers are too I
 
03:20:52.790 --> 03:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
know the details of it because of their
 
03:20:55.490 --> 03:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
association with my city of Nashua
 
03:20:57.469 --> 03:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
Google teachers sexually abusing
 
03:21:00.110 --> 03:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire to find many
 
03:21:02.570 --> 03:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
more such cases
 
03:21:04.849 --> 03:21:04.859 align:start position:0%
most many of those testifying say they
 
03:21:07.190 --> 03:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
are concerned about protecting lgbtq
 
03:21:09.050 --> 03:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
students and that we should
 
03:21:11.389 --> 03:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
automatically trust teachers to do the
 
03:21:13.550 --> 03:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
best for their students and these
 
03:21:15.530 --> 03:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
teachers can be trusted to keep secrets
 
03:21:16.790 --> 03:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
from parents
 
03:21:19.429 --> 03:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
the truth is that no one cares about
 
03:21:22.010 --> 03:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
kids more than their parents teachers
 
03:21:24.530 --> 03:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
are human infallible and they have much
 
03:21:26.330 --> 03:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
less invested in the well-being of
 
03:21:26.340 --> 03:21:27.290 align:start position:0%
less invested in the well-being of
students

03:21:27.290 --> 03:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:21:28.910 --> 03:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
and they have their own interests at
 
03:21:28.920 --> 03:21:30.410 align:start position:0%
and they have their own interests at
heart

03:21:30.410 --> 03:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
heart
 
03:21:32.690 --> 03:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
many say this bill
 
03:21:34.849 --> 03:21:34.859 align:start position:0%
undermines trust between students and
 
03:21:37.309 --> 03:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
teachers but those same people think
 
03:21:39.410 --> 03:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
nothing of undermining the trust between
 
03:21:42.230 --> 03:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
those students and their parents by
 
03:21:43.610 --> 03:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
allowing teachers to hide information
 
03:21:46.130 --> 03:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
from parents
 
03:21:47.870 --> 03:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
children hide a lot of critical
 
03:21:49.730 --> 03:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
information from parents when they are
 
03:21:51.969 --> 03:21:51.979 align:start position:0%
taking illegal drugs cutting themselves
 
03:21:54.590 --> 03:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
starving themselves binging and purging
 
03:21:58.370 --> 03:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
driving recklessly and the list goes on
 
03:22:00.650 --> 03:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
by the same logic I have heard from many
 
03:22:02.630 --> 03:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
the fact that the child is hiding these
 
03:22:04.670 --> 03:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
things from parents means that the
 
03:22:06.170 --> 03:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
parents can't be trusted with that
 
03:22:10.010 --> 03:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
information that is ludicrous
 
03:22:12.650 --> 03:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
and because they fear what teachers are
 
03:22:14.750 --> 03:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
hiding from their kids parents are
 
03:22:17.269 --> 03:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
fleeing Public Schools if you want
 
03:22:19.429 --> 03:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
public schools to thrive then you need
 
03:22:23.389 --> 03:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:26.690 --> 03:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
please vote ought to pass on SB 272 to
 
03:22:29.450 --> 03:22:29.460 align:start position:0%

hello okay I'd say it's nice to see
 
03:22:45.230 --> 03:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
everyone again however
 
03:22:47.870 --> 03:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
we're here for obvious reasons my name
 
03:22:49.010 --> 03:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
is Bill Blum
 
03:22:52.429 --> 03:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
been here far too often to defend myself
 
03:22:54.050 --> 03:22:54.060 align:start position:0%
and my community
 
03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
that I am so
 
03:22:58.490 --> 03:22:58.500 align:start position:0%

um
 
03:23:05.510 --> 03:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
let's just summarize briefly where we're
 
03:23:06.790 --> 03:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
at here
 
03:23:09.610 --> 03:23:09.620 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:23:13.550 --> 03:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
SB 272 is very similar to the one that
 
03:23:16.190 --> 03:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
was here in a full house vote
 
03:23:18.769 --> 03:23:18.779 align:start position:0%
a month ago I set up in the gallery
 
03:23:20.870 --> 03:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
front row witnessed the
 
03:23:22.370 --> 03:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
the vote
 
03:23:24.950 --> 03:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
it did not pass a lot of the words the
 
03:23:26.870 --> 03:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
same a lot of the words in that version
 
03:23:29.210 --> 03:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
are the same in this version
 
03:23:32.030 --> 03:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
why are we here wasting our time why are
 
03:23:33.650 --> 03:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
we here talking about the same thing
 
03:23:37.729 --> 03:23:37.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:41.210 --> 03:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
we talk about parental rights uh listen
 
03:23:44.929 --> 03:23:44.939 align:start position:0%
they're not my daughter is not my dog my
 
03:23:46.429 --> 03:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
daughter is my daughter we are all human
 
03:23:48.650 --> 03:23:48.660 align:start position:0%
beings we all breathe the same air
 
03:23:50.090 --> 03:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
some of you on the other side of the
 
03:23:51.950 --> 03:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
microphone might have different license
 
03:23:54.229 --> 03:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
plates than the people on this side
 
03:23:55.969 --> 03:23:55.979 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter we're all human beings
 
03:23:58.190 --> 03:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
let's Express let's respect each other
 
03:24:02.150 --> 03:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
as such do not force someone to tell
 
03:24:04.010 --> 03:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
their coming out story
 
03:24:06.590 --> 03:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
because that is a sacred sacred thing
 
03:24:10.849 --> 03:24:10.859 align:start position:0%
that I kept secret for 43 years however
 
03:24:13.550 --> 03:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of months the only
 
03:24:15.110 --> 03:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
thing you needed to hear my coming out
 
03:24:17.530 --> 03:24:17.540 align:start position:0%
story was a stable internet connection
 
03:24:20.570 --> 03:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
or the ability to get yourself into this
 
03:24:24.170 --> 03:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
chamber or across the street to hear it
 
03:24:26.450 --> 03:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm a little animated
 
03:24:26.460 --> 03:24:28.070 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm a little animated
the

03:24:28.070 --> 03:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:24:30.710 --> 03:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
one thing that I want to say is is if
 
03:24:32.150 --> 03:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
the parental Bill of Rights is already
 
03:24:34.610 --> 03:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
established why do we need to allow to
 
03:24:36.530 --> 03:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
clarify that there was already a law
 
03:24:38.570 --> 03:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
that says you can't drink and drive a
 
03:24:40.370 --> 03:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
car do we need a law that says you can't
 
03:24:42.429 --> 03:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
put a beer in the cup holder and open it
 
03:24:45.769 --> 03:24:45.779 align:start position:0%
no let's be a realistic people
 
03:24:49.070 --> 03:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
and I will close simply with I got a
 
03:24:51.950 --> 03:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
call from the school last week that did
 
03:24:54.830 --> 03:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
not tell me about my kids preferred
 
03:24:57.830 --> 03:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
pronouns it did not tell me about their
 
03:25:00.290 --> 03:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
name change it told me that someone
 
03:25:02.389 --> 03:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
quote threaded to go threaten to go to
 
03:25:04.729 --> 03:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
the school and shoot it up
 
03:25:04.739 --> 03:25:05.990 align:start position:0%
the school and shoot it up
people

03:25:05.990 --> 03:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:25:08.450 --> 03:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
this is the house education committee
 
03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
can we really take the time and focus on
 
03:25:13.250 --> 03:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
what's important here
 
03:25:15.110 --> 03:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
can we focus
 
03:25:17.929 --> 03:25:17.939 align:start position:0%
on making real change
 
03:25:19.790 --> 03:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
my thought
 
03:25:22.309 --> 03:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
is hopefully your thoughts as well that
 
03:25:25.550 --> 03:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
I our kids leave with the ability to
 
03:25:28.429 --> 03:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
Simply breathe and Thrive and my prayers
 
03:25:30.410 --> 03:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
are that you will not discriminate
 
03:25:32.870 --> 03:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
against marginalized communities that
 
03:25:35.389 --> 03:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
has happened with people of color people
 
03:25:35.399 --> 03:25:36.170 align:start position:0%
has happened with people of color people
of

03:25:36.170 --> 03:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:25:39.229 --> 03:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
gay bisexuals and now to transgendered
 
03:25:42.889 --> 03:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
people thank you thank you very much
 
03:25:45.590 --> 03:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
Anne-Marie Banfield
 
03:25:56.690 --> 03:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:58.370 --> 03:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the House
 
03:26:00.650 --> 03:26:00.660 align:start position:0%
Education committee I am a parental
 
03:26:02.450 --> 03:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
rights Advocate New Hampshire focused on
 
03:26:04.250 --> 03:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
academic excellence
 
03:26:06.170 --> 03:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
parents who struggle to be a voice for
 
03:26:07.729 --> 03:26:07.739 align:start position:0%
their children oftentimes run into
 
03:26:09.590 --> 03:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
lobbying organizations that are well
 
03:26:11.630 --> 03:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
funded and hire high-priced attorneys to
 
03:26:13.790 --> 03:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
fight against them I have no Financial
 
03:26:16.370 --> 03:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
stake in any advocating that I've done
 
03:26:18.290 --> 03:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
on behalf of parents and I've been doing
 
03:26:20.510 --> 03:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
this for 20 years I'm here today because
 
03:26:22.309 --> 03:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
it's the right thing to do
 
03:26:24.590 --> 03:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
School administrators have high priced
 
03:26:26.330 --> 03:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
legal teams that can be extremely
 
03:26:28.790 --> 03:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
intimidating to parents the balance of
 
03:26:31.070 --> 03:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
power has been against parents for many
 
03:26:33.469 --> 03:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
years even if parents have a good case
 
03:26:35.929 --> 03:26:35.939 align:start position:0%
the legal cost to them versus the
 
03:26:38.809 --> 03:26:38.819 align:start position:0%
superintendent who uses taxpayer money
 
03:26:42.349 --> 03:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
and attorneys results in parents giving
 
03:26:44.690 --> 03:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
up they pull their kids out enrollment
 
03:26:46.849 --> 03:26:46.859 align:start position:0%
numbers are going down there's I mean
 
03:26:48.410 --> 03:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
you can look at the numbers
 
03:26:51.410 --> 03:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
Public School enrollment numbers decline
 
03:26:53.750 --> 03:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
private school and home school numbers
 
03:26:55.010 --> 03:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
go up
 
03:26:57.469 --> 03:26:57.479 align:start position:0%
parental rights bill would help shift
 
03:26:59.630 --> 03:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
some of that power back to the parents
 
03:27:02.630 --> 03:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
which would help stop The Exodus from
 
03:27:04.490 --> 03:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
the public schools so that's something
 
03:27:06.769 --> 03:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
just to keep in mind
 
03:27:06.779 --> 03:27:07.969 align:start position:0%
just to keep in mind
um

03:27:07.969 --> 03:27:07.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:10.070 --> 03:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
so let's be honest about the lack of
 
03:27:12.349 --> 03:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
student privacy in our Public Schools
 
03:27:13.490 --> 03:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:27:15.710 --> 03:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
everyone seems to think that personally
 
03:27:18.170 --> 03:27:18.180 align:start position:0%
identifiable information is private it
 
03:27:20.269 --> 03:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
is not
 
03:27:23.690 --> 03:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
who knows who who knows or who how many
 
03:27:27.110 --> 03:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
times if a child comes in and decides to
 
03:27:30.050 --> 03:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
use a different name at school all their
 
03:27:32.570 --> 03:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
teachers know all the children know
 
03:27:34.190 --> 03:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
children go home tell their parents
 
03:27:35.929 --> 03:27:35.939 align:start position:0%
their friends know
 
03:27:38.510 --> 03:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
but now we're telling the schools don't
 
03:27:40.790 --> 03:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
tell the parent so everybody knows but
 
03:27:43.130 --> 03:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
not the parent
 
03:27:46.070 --> 03:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
not only that the schools are told
 
03:27:49.070 --> 03:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
School Personnel lied parents not just
 
03:27:50.630 --> 03:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
keep the information from them but
 
03:27:53.750 --> 03:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
they'll actually lie to them
 
03:27:55.429 --> 03:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
I want to know if you know these people
 
03:27:58.070 --> 03:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say their names Jim foth
 
03:28:01.130 --> 03:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
Megan Phillips George Tremblay Chris
 
03:28:03.769 --> 03:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
Chan Lisa Colby they're just a few
 
03:28:03.779 --> 03:28:05.030 align:start position:0%
Chan Lisa Colby they're just a few
people

03:28:05.030 --> 03:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:28:07.910 --> 03:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
who have access to your child's Mental
 
03:28:09.469 --> 03:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
Health Data
 
03:28:12.229 --> 03:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
that Keene State collects it in the past
 
03:28:14.510 --> 03:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
in Antioch University
 
03:28:16.429 --> 03:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
and Plymouth state
 
03:28:19.010 --> 03:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
so all this information is going out to
 
03:28:20.690 --> 03:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
all kinds of people
 
03:28:22.550 --> 03:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
but again we're going to tell parents
 
03:28:24.170 --> 03:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
nope we're not going to tell you this
 
03:28:26.809 --> 03:28:26.819 align:start position:0%
information we're going to lie to you
 
03:28:29.090 --> 03:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
you know that all of these universities
 
03:28:30.530 --> 03:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
are collecting this mental health
 
03:28:32.870 --> 03:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
information without parental consent or
 
03:28:36.590 --> 03:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
without the student's consent
 
03:28:39.650 --> 03:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
there are people all over the state with
 
03:28:42.650 --> 03:28:42.660 align:start position:0%
access to information on these students
 
03:28:46.070 --> 03:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
but this one time the parent comes in
 
03:28:47.750 --> 03:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
and says what's going on with my child
 
03:28:50.450 --> 03:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
they're being told you are to lie to
 
03:28:53.269 --> 03:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:55.849 --> 03:28:55.859 align:start position:0%
the data security systems
 
03:28:55.859 --> 03:28:56.809 align:start position:0%
the data security systems
um

03:28:56.809 --> 03:28:56.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:00.290 --> 03:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
allow this other people to access this
 
03:29:03.769 --> 03:29:03.779 align:start position:0%
information I urge you to vote
 
03:29:06.050 --> 03:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on this if everybody is
 
03:29:08.570 --> 03:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
getting this information why not parents
 
03:29:10.610 --> 03:29:10.620 align:start position:0%

hello my name is Ariel Hayes I use she
 
03:29:27.170 --> 03:29:27.180 align:start position:0%
her pronouns I am one of the
 
03:29:28.969 --> 03:29:28.979 align:start position:0%
co-directors of the youth success
 
03:29:31.729 --> 03:29:31.739 align:start position:0%
project and I worked as a case manager
 
03:29:33.530 --> 03:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
at Waypoint which is the runaway and
 
03:29:35.330 --> 03:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
homeless youth provider for the state
 
03:29:38.330 --> 03:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
for two years I'm also a queer person
 
03:29:40.550 --> 03:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
and I have experienced unaccompanied
 
03:29:43.250 --> 03:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
homelessness and I'm here today to talk
 
03:29:46.729 --> 03:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
to you about how this bill if it were
 
03:29:49.670 --> 03:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
passed would increase our rate of Youth
 
03:29:50.990 --> 03:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
and Young adults experiencing
 
03:29:52.969 --> 03:29:52.979 align:start position:0%
homelessness in this state
 
03:29:55.010 --> 03:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
something that I have learned again and
 
03:29:57.530 --> 03:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
again through my work in this field is
 
03:30:00.410 --> 03:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
that not all parents are good parents
 
03:30:03.950 --> 03:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
and that young people are often taken
 
03:30:07.910 --> 03:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
advantage of they're used to
 
03:30:11.269 --> 03:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
um meet their parents needs and are
 
03:30:13.190 --> 03:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
often abused in ways that we've already
 
03:30:16.729 --> 03:30:16.739 align:start position:0%
established today can be subtle and may
 
03:30:19.790 --> 03:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
not become known until after they are
 
03:30:23.269 --> 03:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
18. we are not always good at catching
 
03:30:25.450 --> 03:30:25.460 align:start position:0%
when young people are
 
03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
experiencing abuse in the home until
 
03:30:32.330 --> 03:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
after the young person is over 18. not
 
03:30:36.229 --> 03:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
all parents are good parents and lgbtq
 
03:30:38.389 --> 03:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
youth are at an increased risk of
 
03:30:41.150 --> 03:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
homelessness they are 2.2 times more
 
03:30:43.610 --> 03:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
likely to experience homelessness when
 
03:30:49.250 --> 03:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
compared to their peers and 64 of lgbtq
 
03:30:52.550 --> 03:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
Youth had had experienced stigma or
 
03:30:54.889 --> 03:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
discrimination within their family and
 
03:30:57.170 --> 03:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
this is National Data from Chopin Hall
 
03:30:59.269 --> 03:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
at the University of Chicago
 
03:31:03.170 --> 03:31:03.180 align:start position:0%
and ex being a transgender young person
 
03:31:06.410 --> 03:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
is not a choice these young people are
 
03:31:10.309 --> 03:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
facing serious mental health suicide
 
03:31:12.769 --> 03:31:12.779 align:start position:0%
um and discrimination in the home and
 
03:31:17.090 --> 03:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
they need supportive people in a school
 
03:31:18.889 --> 03:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
environment and this bill would take
 
03:31:21.110 --> 03:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
that away from them
 
03:31:23.090 --> 03:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
um and these statistics exist without
 
03:31:25.250 --> 03:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
this bill being present
 
03:31:27.710 --> 03:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
young people become more vulnerable when
 
03:31:30.530 --> 03:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
they're homeless too lgbtq youth are at
 
03:31:32.870 --> 03:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
an increased risk of being forced to
 
03:31:34.849 --> 03:31:34.859 align:start position:0%
have sex being physically harmed by
 
03:31:37.849 --> 03:31:37.859 align:start position:0%
others maybe needing to exchange sex to
 
03:31:40.190 --> 03:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
get their basic needs met and these are
 
03:31:42.650 --> 03:31:42.660 align:start position:0%
compounding risk factors and young
 
03:31:44.450 --> 03:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
people are often kicked out of their
 
03:31:46.250 --> 03:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
parents homes
 
03:31:48.229 --> 03:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
um if their parents are not supportive
 
03:31:50.510 --> 03:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
and not ready to support them
 
03:31:52.849 --> 03:31:52.859 align:start position:0%
um when they
 
03:31:54.370 --> 03:31:54.380 align:start position:0%
come out
 
03:31:57.229 --> 03:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
and if this bill becomes law it will
 
03:31:59.210 --> 03:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
make teachers and school administrators
 
03:32:01.849 --> 03:32:01.859 align:start position:0%
responsible for outing a young parent a
 
03:32:04.070 --> 03:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
young person to parents who are not safe
 
03:32:06.410 --> 03:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
and supportive
 
03:32:09.110 --> 03:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not being dramatic these things
 
03:32:12.229 --> 03:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
happen they happen to an estimated over
 
03:32:15.170 --> 03:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
16 000 young people in this state each
 
03:32:18.170 --> 03:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
year and bypassing this bill you would
 
03:32:20.210 --> 03:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
be taking away a Young Person's right to
 
03:32:21.830 --> 03:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
keep themselves safe
 
03:32:24.110 --> 03:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
we have enough homeless youth in this
 
03:32:26.690 --> 03:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
state we do not need more I urge you to
 
03:32:28.250 --> 03:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
03:32:30.469 --> 03:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:32:32.990 --> 03:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
Laura Condon
 
03:32:38.150 --> 03:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:55.490 --> 03:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:57.190 --> 03:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:33:00.050 --> 03:33:00.060 align:start position:0%
my name is Lane Lloyd I'm a resident of
 
03:33:02.090 --> 03:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
Durham and I'm testifying in opposition
 
03:33:04.190 --> 03:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
to SB 272
 
03:33:06.050 --> 03:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
the last time that I stood in this room
 
03:33:09.170 --> 03:33:09.180 align:start position:0%
it was for a fourth grade field trip and
 
03:33:11.210 --> 03:33:11.220 align:start position:0%
in ninth grade I started Pelham New
 
03:33:13.070 --> 03:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's first gay straight Alliance
 
03:33:15.590 --> 03:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
Group dated for the first time and
 
03:33:17.750 --> 03:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
changed my name socially without the
 
03:33:20.210 --> 03:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
context and connotations of gender and
 
03:33:22.250 --> 03:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
sexuality these are activities that
 
03:33:24.830 --> 03:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
almost any teen might partake in however
 
03:33:27.769 --> 03:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
these things did concern my mom and she
 
03:33:29.809 --> 03:33:29.819 align:start position:0%
thought I was too young maybe influenced
 
03:33:32.229 --> 03:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
by my peers or the internet
 
03:33:34.550 --> 03:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
and most importantly thought that being
 
03:33:36.590 --> 03:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
gay or trans meant being isolated
 
03:33:38.870 --> 03:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
marginalized and miserable simply put
 
03:33:41.450 --> 03:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
she didn't want my life to be harder So
 
03:33:43.370 --> 03:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
to avoid conflict we entered a mutual
 
03:33:45.710 --> 03:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
don't ask don't tell period which lasted
 
03:33:47.690 --> 03:33:47.700 align:start position:0%
several years
 
03:33:49.370 --> 03:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
um well decided to come here and testify
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
I talked to my mom about this bill 15
 
03:33:53.510 --> 03:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
years or so after the fact I wondered
 
03:33:56.090 --> 03:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
what she might think now she responded
 
03:33:58.250 --> 03:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
that these conversations should be on
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
one's own terms and timelines not the
 
03:34:02.330 --> 03:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
governments simply put the state doesn't
 
03:34:04.370 --> 03:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
need to have a seat at the family dinner
 
03:34:04.380 --> 03:34:05.570 align:start position:0%
need to have a seat at the family dinner
table

03:34:05.570 --> 03:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
table
 
03:34:07.429 --> 03:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
because my school did not compulsively
 
03:34:08.809 --> 03:34:08.819 align:start position:0%
Force conversations that we weren't
 
03:34:11.030 --> 03:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
ready for I had the opportunity to take
 
03:34:12.710 --> 03:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
enough breathing room to find out who I
 
03:34:15.050 --> 03:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
was to live my life as I felt more
 
03:34:17.630 --> 03:34:17.640 align:start position:0%
comfortable and to make more lifelong
 
03:34:19.429 --> 03:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
friends at a school club like all the
 
03:34:20.990 --> 03:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
other kids
 
03:34:23.269 --> 03:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
when my family and I finally did decide
 
03:34:24.889 --> 03:34:24.899 align:start position:0%
to have these conversations I came into
 
03:34:26.630 --> 03:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
it as an established and confident
 
03:34:29.090 --> 03:34:29.100 align:start position:0%
person with a lot more life experience
 
03:34:30.830 --> 03:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
there was living proof that looking and
 
03:34:32.630 --> 03:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
acting as myself meant living a happy
 
03:34:34.670 --> 03:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
and genuine life as opposed to the scary
 
03:34:36.410 --> 03:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
and lonely life that they had imagined
 
03:34:38.210 --> 03:34:38.220 align:start position:0%
and feared for me
 
03:34:39.950 --> 03:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
today my parents and I have a healthy
 
03:34:41.690 --> 03:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
and communicative relationship and we
 
03:34:43.190 --> 03:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
run a small family business in Derry
 
03:34:43.200 --> 03:34:44.389 align:start position:0%
run a small family business in Derry
together

03:34:44.389 --> 03:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:34:46.429 --> 03:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
I want this to be possible for all kids
 
03:34:48.410 --> 03:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
and teens and their families for youth
 
03:34:49.910 --> 03:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
to have the same opportunity as everyone
 
03:34:51.469 --> 03:34:51.479 align:start position:0%
else to decide when to have tough
 
03:34:53.570 --> 03:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
conversations and if they are not in
 
03:34:56.389 --> 03:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
danger to be able to put trust in
 
03:34:58.670 --> 03:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
qualified adults at school and being
 
03:35:01.969 --> 03:35:01.979 align:start position:0%
LGBT in and of itself is not a danger
 
03:35:03.889 --> 03:35:03.899 align:start position:0%
uh I was lucky to have a guidance
 
03:35:05.330 --> 03:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
counselor who could provide a listening
 
03:35:07.309 --> 03:35:07.319 align:start position:0%
ear and basic support the way anyone who
 
03:35:08.929 --> 03:35:08.939 align:start position:0%
works with children and teens does for
 
03:35:11.269 --> 03:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
small and large problems alike
 
03:35:13.729 --> 03:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
no teacher introduced the concept of
 
03:35:15.830 --> 03:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
same-sex attractive attraction or gender
 
03:35:17.809 --> 03:35:17.819 align:start position:0%
non-conformity to me my guidance
 
03:35:20.450 --> 03:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
counselor didn't say did you know that
 
03:35:21.830 --> 03:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
some kids changed their names and you
 
03:35:23.090 --> 03:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
could too
 
03:35:25.429 --> 03:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
she didn't say that I could start a gay
 
03:35:28.309 --> 03:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
start Alliance I asked her
 
03:35:30.290 --> 03:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
um it's totally new neutral information
 
03:35:32.929 --> 03:35:32.939 align:start position:0%
but no one presented me with it I at 14
 
03:35:35.990 --> 03:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
went to them no teacher unprompted ever
 
03:35:37.729 --> 03:35:37.739 align:start position:0%
tried to steer me towards a particular
 
03:35:39.410 --> 03:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
future other than a happy and healthy
 
03:35:41.389 --> 03:35:41.399 align:start position:0%
one at no point Did a New Hampshire
 
03:35:43.370 --> 03:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
Public School indoctrinate me into a
 
03:35:45.650 --> 03:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
gender identity or sexuality I learned
 
03:35:47.269 --> 03:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
what being gay meant the way that many
 
03:35:49.309 --> 03:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
kids do which is being teased by other
 
03:35:51.190 --> 03:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
kids for looking like it
 
03:35:53.750 --> 03:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
as my own feelings developed I realized
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
they were right about me but safe
 
03:35:57.050 --> 03:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
interested adults in my school helped me
 
03:35:58.490 --> 03:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
to see that they were also wrong in the
 
03:36:00.590 --> 03:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
ways of the matter my teachers were not
 
03:36:02.570 --> 03:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
keeping secrets from my parents they
 
03:36:05.030 --> 03:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
were keeping confidences with me
 
03:36:07.849 --> 03:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
SB 272 is a thinly veiled attempt to
 
03:36:09.830 --> 03:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
fearmonger about transgender people in
 
03:36:12.110 --> 03:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
order to chip away and have run out of
 
03:36:14.150 --> 03:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
time all right well thank you you're
 
03:36:16.070 --> 03:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
more than welcome

03:36:34.790 --> 03:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
hi I'm going to ignore everything I have
 
03:36:36.229 --> 03:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
written down because it's all been said
 
03:36:38.090 --> 03:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
so many times before
 
03:36:39.950 --> 03:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
I don't want to just repeat things over
 
03:36:42.410 --> 03:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
and over again I have a master's in
 
03:36:44.990 --> 03:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
education I've spent eight years up till
 
03:36:47.990 --> 03:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
this point in public schools middle
 
03:36:49.849 --> 03:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
school and high school
 
03:36:54.710 --> 03:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
and I rise in support of this bill now I
 
03:36:54.720 --> 03:36:56.990 align:start position:0%
and I rise in support of this bill now I
love

03:36:56.990 --> 03:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:58.849 --> 03:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
the young people that I've worked with
 
03:37:00.530 --> 03:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
and they love me
 
03:37:03.229 --> 03:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
and I think that any adult that tells a
 
03:37:04.969 --> 03:37:04.979 align:start position:0%
young person
 
03:37:08.330 --> 03:37:08.340 align:start position:0%
that people don't like you or they're
 
03:37:10.370 --> 03:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
trying to attack you is not doing you a
 
03:37:13.969 --> 03:37:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:17.750 --> 03:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
I don't pretend to understand why
 
03:37:19.969 --> 03:37:19.979 align:start position:0%
the only kids that came to me talking
 
03:37:22.550 --> 03:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
like this had autism
 
03:37:24.830 --> 03:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't surprise me when I read
 
03:37:27.830 --> 03:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
the studies that show that they're far
 
03:37:31.010 --> 03:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
more likely I don't know why
 
03:37:32.870 --> 03:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
but it is the truth
 
03:37:35.210 --> 03:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
I don't know why they have four times
 
03:37:37.969 --> 03:37:37.979 align:start position:0%
higher rate of committing suicide I
 
03:37:41.870 --> 03:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
don't know why but it is the truth
 
03:37:44.030 --> 03:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
I know what it's like to be a survivor
 
03:37:46.670 --> 03:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
of suicide to be left behind by someone
 
03:37:49.550 --> 03:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
who committed that horrible act and how
 
03:37:52.370 --> 03:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
you feel responsible that maybe there
 
03:37:54.650 --> 03:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
was something you did or didn't do
 
03:37:56.570 --> 03:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
that could have changed things
 
03:38:00.349 --> 03:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
and we hear people here are afraid that
 
03:38:03.469 --> 03:38:03.479 align:start position:0%
young transgendered people or gay people
 
03:38:05.269 --> 03:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
are more likely to commit suicide
 
03:38:07.250 --> 03:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
suicide is not going to take place at
 
03:38:08.690 --> 03:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
the school
 
03:38:12.769 --> 03:38:12.779 align:start position:0%
they don't have the time or the privacy
 
03:38:14.929 --> 03:38:14.939 align:start position:0%
to commit the ACT it's going to take
 
03:38:16.790 --> 03:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
place at home
 
03:38:20.929 --> 03:38:20.939 align:start position:0%
this bill does not require a teacher to
 
03:38:25.130 --> 03:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
out every kid this bill says that when a
 
03:38:25.140 --> 03:38:25.969 align:start position:0%
out every kid this bill says that when a
parent

03:38:25.969 --> 03:38:25.979 align:start position:0%
parent
 
03:38:29.809 --> 03:38:29.819 align:start position:0%
is worried in some way for some reason
 
03:38:33.229 --> 03:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
and ask me directly
 
03:38:35.210 --> 03:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
I'm to tell the truth
 
03:38:38.150 --> 03:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
if I know and I do know that they're
 
03:38:41.389 --> 03:38:41.399 align:start position:0%
more likely to commit suicide when they
 
03:38:41.399 --> 03:38:43.250 align:start position:0%
more likely to commit suicide when they
identify

03:38:43.250 --> 03:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
identify
 
03:38:46.090 --> 03:38:46.100 align:start position:0%
and I have a parent that's worried
 
03:38:50.330 --> 03:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
asking me to lie as part of my
 
03:38:54.170 --> 03:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
professional duty is unacceptable
 
03:38:57.349 --> 03:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
I we can't fix everything the schools
 
03:38:59.630 --> 03:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
can't fix all these problems we can't
 
03:39:01.849 --> 03:39:01.859 align:start position:0%
even understand them all
 
03:39:05.510 --> 03:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
but adding something bad
 
03:39:07.550 --> 03:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
is not going to help
 
03:39:10.929 --> 03:39:10.939 align:start position:0%
asking teachers to lie
 
03:39:14.570 --> 03:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
directly lie when asked a specific
 
03:39:16.309 --> 03:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
pointed question
 
03:39:18.769 --> 03:39:18.779 align:start position:0%
is a bridge too far
 
03:39:20.929 --> 03:39:20.939 align:start position:0%
you know this used to be a calling and
 
03:39:23.330 --> 03:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
people used to do it for their entire
 
03:39:26.210 --> 03:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
careers they were teachers for their
 
03:39:29.090 --> 03:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
entire 30-year working career that's not
 
03:39:31.010 --> 03:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
the case anymore it's now five to seven
 
03:39:31.020 --> 03:39:32.150 align:start position:0%
the case anymore it's now five to seven
years

03:39:32.150 --> 03:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:39:32.160 --> 03:39:33.650 align:start position:0%
years
why

03:39:33.650 --> 03:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
why
 
03:39:35.750 --> 03:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
we don't need any more teachers driven
 
03:39:40.070 --> 03:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
from this profession by being asked to
 
03:39:42.410 --> 03:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
do things that are against their
 
03:39:42.420 --> 03:39:43.729 align:start position:0%
do things that are against their
conscience

03:39:43.729 --> 03:39:43.739 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
03:39:46.610 --> 03:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
so I I ask you to support the Bill thank
 
03:39:50.630 --> 03:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:55.969 --> 03:39:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:14.990 --> 03:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:18.590 --> 03:40:18.600 align:start position:0%

03:40:20.210 --> 03:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
live in Manchester and I was asked to
 
03:40:21.710 --> 03:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
come here today to speak to you about
 
03:40:25.309 --> 03:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
why sb272 is an important bill to pass
 
03:40:26.450 --> 03:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
into law
 
03:40:28.370 --> 03:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
I am a nurse who has worked in the field
 
03:40:30.469 --> 03:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
of medicine for 30 years
 
03:40:32.690 --> 03:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
I fully support a state law supporting
 
03:40:35.210 --> 03:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
parental rights there are many medical
 
03:40:38.330 --> 03:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
Provisions listed in SB 272 that support
 
03:40:40.670 --> 03:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
our rights as parents
 
03:40:43.370 --> 03:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
it includes a provision that says that
 
03:40:45.590 --> 03:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
the school personnel must respond in a
 
03:40:48.229 --> 03:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
truthful and informed manner if School
 
03:40:49.849 --> 03:40:49.859 align:start position:0%
Personnel begin to proceed with
 
03:40:52.190 --> 03:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
affirming or intervening with a child's
 
03:40:53.690 --> 03:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
gender identity
 
03:40:55.610 --> 03:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
some of this could involve a level of
 
03:40:57.469 --> 03:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
mental health counseling
 
03:40:59.929 --> 03:40:59.939 align:start position:0%
Federal Law requires parental consent
 
03:41:02.269 --> 03:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
when assessing or providing Mental
 
03:41:04.849 --> 03:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
Health Services in school you can find
 
03:41:07.370 --> 03:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
that in every student succeeds act which
 
03:41:10.790 --> 03:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
was signed by President Obama in 2015.
 
03:41:13.130 --> 03:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
there are many good medical reasons why
 
03:41:14.870 --> 03:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
it is important that no one in the
 
03:41:16.370 --> 03:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
school lies to parents about their
 
03:41:19.070 --> 03:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
children's Behavior if it's okay to lie
 
03:41:20.690 --> 03:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
to parents about their children for one
 
03:41:22.550 --> 03:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
reason where does it end
 
03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
medical journals and research paper all
 
03:41:26.929 --> 03:41:26.939 align:start position:0%
agree that any medical and psychological
 
03:41:28.610 --> 03:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
interventions is to be carefully
 
03:41:31.070 --> 03:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
analyzed and parents and children need
 
03:41:33.650 --> 03:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
to be well informed this is apparently
 
03:41:35.389 --> 03:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
not being utilized by the Manchester
 
03:41:37.309 --> 03:41:37.319 align:start position:0%

03:45:00.530 --> 03:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
go ahead hi I'm Kate McCarty and I'm a
 
03:45:01.910 --> 03:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire and a parent
 
03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
and I oppose sp272
 
03:45:06.590 --> 03:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
I feel like this whole thing could be
 
03:45:08.389 --> 03:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
solved if we listen to the experts on
 
03:45:10.910 --> 03:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
the subject the experts say this is a
 
03:45:13.309 --> 03:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
terrible idea most reasonable people
 
03:45:16.670 --> 03:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
listen to The Experts but here we are
 
03:45:18.530 --> 03:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
here's a quote from the National
 
03:45:20.570 --> 03:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
Children's Advocacy Center
 
03:45:22.610 --> 03:45:22.620 align:start position:0%
there are many worries for a child abuse
 
03:45:25.490 --> 03:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
Survivor that can silence them research
 
03:45:27.410 --> 03:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
and surveys indicate disclosure rates
 
03:45:30.349 --> 03:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
may be as low as 16 percent to 25
 
03:45:33.229 --> 03:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
percent and fewer than 25 percent of
 
03:45:35.210 --> 03:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
victims are said to disclose immediately
 
03:45:36.710 --> 03:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
following the abuse
 
03:45:38.450 --> 03:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
kids don't run around telling people
 
03:45:40.610 --> 03:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
that they're being abused at home it's a
 
03:45:42.229 --> 03:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
secret they keep often from their
 
03:45:44.389 --> 03:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
closest friends remember those friends
 
03:45:46.130 --> 03:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
that for some reason never let anyone
 
03:45:47.870 --> 03:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
come to their house
 
03:45:47.880 --> 03:45:48.950 align:start position:0%
come to their house
yeah

03:45:48.950 --> 03:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
so imagine I'm one of those parents who
 
03:45:52.670 --> 03:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
are not supportive of their lgbtq child
 
03:45:54.889 --> 03:45:54.899 align:start position:0%
or maybe violent toward their own child
 
03:45:58.010 --> 03:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
for being different they exist I know
 
03:46:01.490 --> 03:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
this and more importantly you know this
 
03:46:02.809 --> 03:46:02.819 align:start position:0%
it can be difficult to picture
 
03:46:04.550 --> 03:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
especially if you are not one of those
 
03:46:06.830 --> 03:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
parents but they're out there we've all
 
03:46:08.809 --> 03:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
read the stories we've all been shocked
 
03:46:11.090 --> 03:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
by the depravity of their abuse it's not
 
03:46:12.170 --> 03:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
a secret
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
when you come from an abusive
 
03:46:15.290 --> 03:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
environment you learn very quickly to
 
03:46:17.389 --> 03:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
mask it's a survival tool it's a
 
03:46:19.969 --> 03:46:19.979 align:start position:0%
Lifeboat on rough Seas you use it until
 
03:46:22.610 --> 03:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
you're safe if this bill passes you are
 
03:46:24.110 --> 03:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
not only going to endanger countless
 
03:46:25.670 --> 03:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
children who have been hanging on by a
 
03:46:27.769 --> 03:46:27.779 align:start position:0%
thread sitting in that Lifeboat just
 
03:46:29.269 --> 03:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
trying to make it until they can live on
 
03:46:31.490 --> 03:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
their own terms but you have also signed
 
03:46:33.769 --> 03:46:33.779 align:start position:0%
off on countless suicides make no
 
03:46:36.110 --> 03:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
mistake teachers are often those
 
03:46:36.120 --> 03:46:37.429 align:start position:0%
mistake teachers are often those
lifeboats

03:46:37.429 --> 03:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
lifeboats
 
03:46:39.830 --> 03:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
these kids are tired they deal with
 
03:46:42.349 --> 03:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
lockdown grills cyber bullying climate
 
03:46:44.269 --> 03:46:44.279 align:start position:0%
change all while navigating the most
 
03:46:46.130 --> 03:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
confusing time of their lives the one
 
03:46:48.830 --> 03:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
that we call adolescence and now they
 
03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
can't even turn to a trusted teacher to
 
03:46:52.969 --> 03:46:52.979 align:start position:0%
say hey I'm scared and confused can you
 
03:46:55.969 --> 03:46:55.979 align:start position:0%
help me please don't do this they're
 
03:46:58.910 --> 03:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
running out of lifeboats thank you
 
03:47:02.570 --> 03:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:04.969 --> 03:47:04.979 align:start position:0%
Betsy Harrington hi I'm Betsy Harrington
 
03:47:06.349 --> 03:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
I'm from Deering
 
03:47:09.769 --> 03:47:09.779 align:start position:0%
I am a mother of three boys two are in
 
03:47:12.170 --> 03:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
public school now in high school one is
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
adopted and had an IEP and was very
 
03:47:16.790 --> 03:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
difficult to manage through the school
 
03:47:16.800 --> 03:47:17.929 align:start position:0%
difficult to manage through the school
system

03:47:17.929 --> 03:47:17.939 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:47:21.170 --> 03:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
I would never approve of Secrets why
 
03:47:23.030 --> 03:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
would I send my kids to a place that
 
03:47:25.309 --> 03:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
kept secrets when I could just send them
 
03:47:27.410 --> 03:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
somewhere else or homeschool them so I
 
03:47:29.630 --> 03:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
feel like we're destroying the system by
 
03:47:31.670 --> 03:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
creating this
 
03:47:35.630 --> 03:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
States sanctioned Secrets like that just
 
03:47:38.090 --> 03:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
seems bizarre to me as a sex offender
 
03:47:41.210 --> 03:47:41.220 align:start position:0%
counselor and a therapist I I feel like
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
we need to protect the kids I'm finding
 
03:47:46.070 --> 03:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
pornography in my kids school I brought
 
03:47:48.469 --> 03:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
it to the school there is no challenge
 
03:47:52.490 --> 03:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
policy at SAU 34. so I know all you say
 
03:47:55.250 --> 03:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
that all this is unnecessary and these
 
03:47:57.349 --> 03:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
laws that are in this bill are already
 
03:47:59.570 --> 03:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
happening they're not I cannot challenge
 
03:48:02.630 --> 03:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
this book is gay which has embedded
 
03:48:05.870 --> 03:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
hyperlinks to match.com and Grindr in
 
03:48:08.870 --> 03:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
the section of the book that says how to
 
03:48:12.349 --> 03:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
use sex apps so if I can't stop my kids
 
03:48:14.690 --> 03:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
from getting misinformation about sex
 
03:48:18.110 --> 03:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
from the school why would I send them so
 
03:48:20.269 --> 03:48:20.279 align:start position:0%
I feel like by allowing these secrets
 
03:48:24.110 --> 03:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to send me away and I heard
 
03:48:25.849 --> 03:48:25.859 align:start position:0%
other parents that came up and said that
 
03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
they'd stopped sending their kids to
 
03:48:30.590 --> 03:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
school for this reason we're here as
 
03:48:33.469 --> 03:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
parents because we love our kids we have
 
03:48:35.870 --> 03:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
we're not giving them to you
 
03:48:38.570 --> 03:48:38.580 align:start position:0%
obviously any parent who could say no to
 
03:48:40.490 --> 03:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
that would say no to that
 
03:48:43.550 --> 03:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm not co-parenting with you and if
 
03:48:45.410 --> 03:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
you guys decide to keep secrets then
 
03:48:47.269 --> 03:48:47.279 align:start position:0%
I'll take my kids out like these other
 
03:48:49.849 --> 03:48:49.859 align:start position:0%
parents have you ruin the system
 
03:48:53.630 --> 03:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
I love my kids and I love every one of
 
03:48:56.090 --> 03:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
you I care about you I don't want to
 
03:48:59.450 --> 03:48:59.460 align:start position:0%
erase you I want you to be represented
 
03:49:01.370 --> 03:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
I just don't think we should be keeping
 
03:49:04.309 --> 03:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
secrets if I called the school now the
 
03:49:06.110 --> 03:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
school's not supposed to call me to tell
 
03:49:08.330 --> 03:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
me that my kids gay or choosing a
 
03:49:09.410 --> 03:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
different pronoun
 
03:49:12.410 --> 03:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
if I called the school and I asked you
 
03:49:14.990 --> 03:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
hey is my kid having any issues like do
 
03:49:16.610 --> 03:49:16.620 align:start position:0%
I need to maybe bring him to a therapist
 
03:49:19.010 --> 03:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
or something I would hope that you would
 
03:49:24.889 --> 03:49:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:26.990 --> 03:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
and now who's really going to be
 
03:49:29.450 --> 03:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
suicidal who are you really helping
 
03:49:32.269 --> 03:49:32.279 align:start position:0%
let's be real you have to protect the
 
03:49:33.889 --> 03:49:33.899 align:start position:0%
parents here or we're just going to give
 
03:49:35.990 --> 03:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
up on your silly system
 
03:49:40.790 --> 03:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
please support SB 272 thank you thank
 
03:49:43.849 --> 03:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:49.790 --> 03:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:55.849 --> 03:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:55.859 --> 03:50:02.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:50:02.990 --> 03:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:06.410 --> 03:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
welcome Lori hi thank you thank you to
 
03:50:07.969 --> 03:50:07.979 align:start position:0%
everyone everyone who came I know
 
03:50:10.910 --> 03:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
everyone on both sides of the issue feel
 
03:50:13.250 --> 03:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
a lot about the issue
 
03:50:16.250 --> 03:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
um a lot of what I prepared is
 
03:50:18.710 --> 03:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
already been said I want to concentrate
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
on two things though
 
03:50:23.630 --> 03:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
this is literally a bill which will not
 
03:50:25.790 --> 03:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
only allow teachers in school
 
03:50:29.630 --> 03:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
administration to lie to parents
 
03:50:32.510 --> 03:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
but it actually encourages them to lie
 
03:50:34.150 --> 03:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
to parents
 
03:50:39.050 --> 03:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
just so you know I'm I'm a parent of two
 
03:50:42.590 --> 03:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
boys one grandson I have a ton of nieces
 
03:50:46.070 --> 03:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
and nephews who I care deeply about
 
03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
there's not one teacher in any of their
 
03:50:50.389 --> 03:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
school systems who care more about them
 
03:50:51.950 --> 03:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
than I do
 
03:50:54.769 --> 03:50:54.779 align:start position:0%
there's not one school administrator who
 
03:50:57.769 --> 03:50:57.779 align:start position:0%
loves and cherishes that child
 
03:51:00.290 --> 03:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
more than the parent does
 
03:51:02.269 --> 03:51:02.279 align:start position:0%
I want what's right
 
03:51:04.610 --> 03:51:04.620 align:start position:0%
for my kid and if my kid comes to me and
 
03:51:07.610 --> 03:51:07.620 align:start position:0%
says that he's gay or he's trans or I'll
 
03:51:10.190 --> 03:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
deal with that as a matter of fact I did
 
03:51:12.410 --> 03:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
deal with that
 
03:51:16.070 --> 03:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
but for the experts to say that parents
 
03:51:18.830 --> 03:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
don't understand or Christian parents
 
03:51:20.870 --> 03:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
are going to be evil to their children
 
03:51:22.849 --> 03:51:22.859 align:start position:0%
it's just not right
 
03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
by opposing this bill you're giving
 
03:51:29.510 --> 03:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
people the permission to lie to parents
 
03:51:32.210 --> 03:51:32.220 align:start position:0%
think about that I mean from from a very
 
03:51:34.190 --> 03:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
young age we teach our kids don't lie
 
03:51:36.110 --> 03:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
don't lie
 
03:51:38.150 --> 03:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
and now you guys are actually hiding
 
03:51:39.530 --> 03:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
things from them
 
03:51:41.929 --> 03:51:41.939 align:start position:0%
the second part the second point I want
 
03:51:44.809 --> 03:51:44.819 align:start position:0%
to bring up is that just to bridge on
 
03:51:47.210 --> 03:51:47.220 align:start position:0%
what somebody else said
 
03:51:49.729 --> 03:51:49.739 align:start position:0%
for a school to know that somebody is
 
03:51:52.309 --> 03:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
coming out as trans or lgtb
 
03:51:54.110 --> 03:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
cue um
 
03:51:56.450 --> 03:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
with the high suicides rate sometimes
 
03:51:59.510 --> 03:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
four times as likely to commit suicide
 
03:52:01.190 --> 03:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
and just sending him home without
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
parents even knowing
 
03:52:04.849 --> 03:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
you're asking these kids to live a
 
03:52:06.349 --> 03:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
double life
 
03:52:09.170 --> 03:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
not only that but
 
03:52:11.030 --> 03:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
you're telling these kids you can be a
 
03:52:13.550 --> 03:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
boy now but just make sure you're a girl
 
03:52:15.349 --> 03:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
at home so what happens over school
 
03:52:16.849 --> 03:52:16.859 align:start position:0%
vacation what happens with a summer
 
03:52:20.330 --> 03:52:20.340 align:start position:0%
vacation these parents have no idea the
 
03:52:23.210 --> 03:52:23.220 align:start position:0%
trauma and and the instability they feel
 
03:52:26.750 --> 03:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
inside there's no help for them at home
 
03:52:30.170 --> 03:52:30.180 align:start position:0%
it's not the government's right to lie
 
03:52:31.849 --> 03:52:31.859 align:start position:0%
to parents
 
03:52:36.050 --> 03:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:37.550 --> 03:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:44.750 --> 03:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:49.849 --> 03:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:00.490 --> 03:53:00.500 align:start position:0%

Jessica Bowman or your over here Denise
 
03:53:07.429 --> 03:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
Woodward okay welcome thank you very
 
03:53:10.849 --> 03:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
much thank you everyone for having me
 
03:53:12.410 --> 03:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
I prepared a little something I come
 
03:53:13.969 --> 03:53:13.979 align:start position:0%
from a different Viewpoint than most
 
03:53:17.150 --> 03:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
people I think with my background
 
03:53:19.250 --> 03:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to start out by giving a
 
03:53:21.410 --> 03:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
little bit about my background
 
03:53:24.349 --> 03:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
first and foremost I am a Christian
 
03:53:26.269 --> 03:53:26.279 align:start position:0%
I was a former teacher in the public
 
03:53:28.790 --> 03:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
school system here in New Hampshire
 
03:53:31.969 --> 03:53:31.979 align:start position:0%
I am also a retired nurse and a member
 
03:53:35.510 --> 03:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the LGBT plus community
 
03:53:38.210 --> 03:53:38.220 align:start position:0%
I brought two very successful children
 
03:53:40.910 --> 03:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
in this world and they are not parents
 
03:53:40.920 --> 03:53:42.889 align:start position:0%
in this world and they are not parents
themselves

03:53:42.889 --> 03:53:42.899 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
03:53:44.870 --> 03:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
as a parent
 
03:53:46.729 --> 03:53:46.739 align:start position:0%
I would like to know that my children
 
03:53:50.030 --> 03:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
and grandchildren would be given respect
 
03:53:53.150 --> 03:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
from their teachers and school systems
 
03:53:56.570 --> 03:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
to continue with an open dialogue when
 
03:53:58.429 --> 03:53:58.439 align:start position:0%
it comes to their education and
 
03:53:58.439 --> 03:53:59.809 align:start position:0%
it comes to their education and
development

03:53:59.809 --> 03:53:59.819 align:start position:0%
development
 
03:54:02.570 --> 03:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
we have developed teacher parent nights
 
03:54:06.170 --> 03:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
for a reason but it doesn't end there
 
03:54:09.469 --> 03:54:09.479 align:start position:0%
open and honest communication with
 
03:54:12.530 --> 03:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
parents or parents
 
03:54:16.550 --> 03:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
and a teaching staff should create a
 
03:54:20.030 --> 03:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
team for the same cause a well-rounded
 
03:54:22.190 --> 03:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
student and hopefully an important
 
03:54:24.950 --> 03:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
member of our society
 
03:54:27.290 --> 03:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
as a former New Hampshire certified
 
03:54:30.290 --> 03:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
teacher for 20 years
 
03:54:32.929 --> 03:54:32.939 align:start position:0%
and in our New Hampshire systems here I
 
03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
I taught in two of them as a high school
 
03:54:35.040 --> 03:54:36.050 align:start position:0%
I taught in two of them as a high school
teacher

03:54:36.050 --> 03:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
03:54:38.990 --> 03:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
I have the utmost respect to my fellow
 
03:54:41.929 --> 03:54:41.939 align:start position:0%
teachers I understand the daily battles
 
03:54:44.450 --> 03:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
and victories that they go on that goes
 
03:54:47.269 --> 03:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
on in a classroom every day I support
 
03:54:50.090 --> 03:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
and salute you with the added pressures
 
03:54:52.729 --> 03:54:52.739 align:start position:0%
that both parents and teachers undertake
 
03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
at any given time throughout the
 
03:54:56.450 --> 03:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
Academic Year
 
03:54:59.570 --> 03:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
pressure comes from all directions it
 
03:55:02.269 --> 03:55:02.279 align:start position:0%
could be violence lack of performance
 
03:55:06.229 --> 03:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
academically discipline or a new
 
03:55:08.269 --> 03:55:08.279 align:start position:0%
educational regime
 
03:55:10.969 --> 03:55:10.979 align:start position:0%
these are all difficult times for both
 
03:55:13.729 --> 03:55:13.739 align:start position:0%
teachers and parents we need to work
 
03:55:17.090 --> 03:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
together as mandated by our codes of
 
03:55:21.469 --> 03:55:21.479 align:start position:0%
Ethics division is weakness and
 
03:55:25.130 --> 03:55:25.140 align:start position:0%
disruptive towards our ultimate goal the
 
03:55:25.140 --> 03:55:26.750 align:start position:0%
disruptive towards our ultimate goal the
students

03:55:26.750 --> 03:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:55:30.110 --> 03:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
this means every student is our
 
03:55:30.120 --> 03:55:32.090 align:start position:0%
this means every student is our
responsibility

03:55:32.090 --> 03:55:32.100 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
03:55:35.510 --> 03:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
both parents and teachers remain as
 
03:55:39.550 --> 03:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
integral Parts excuse me integral parts
 
03:55:42.410 --> 03:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
informing that child and awarding
 
03:55:45.590 --> 03:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities for success that's what we
 
03:55:45.600 --> 03:55:46.790 align:start position:0%
opportunities for success that's what we
want

03:55:46.790 --> 03:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
want
 
03:55:50.750 --> 03:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
and I was that teacher that kids came to
 
03:55:52.250 --> 03:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
in my life
 
03:55:56.090 --> 03:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
and I never turned a kid away and I
 
03:55:59.290 --> 03:55:59.300 align:start position:0%
worked with gays trans abusive kids
 
03:56:01.910 --> 03:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
everything and they came on their own
 
03:56:01.920 --> 03:56:03.290 align:start position:0%
everything and they came on their own
volition

03:56:03.290 --> 03:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
volition
 
03:56:05.150 --> 03:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
and to say it ends at three no that's
 
03:56:07.010 --> 03:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
when it starts for a lot of those kids
 
03:56:09.530 --> 03:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
they come after school they want to talk
 
03:56:10.910 --> 03:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
to you
 
03:56:15.229 --> 03:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
as a member your time is up now okay I
 
03:56:17.389 --> 03:56:17.399 align:start position:0%
was going to just do that but I'm going
 
03:56:19.849 --> 03:56:19.859 align:start position:0%
for the bill please let's re-look at
 
03:56:22.250 --> 03:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
this and do those amendments and make a
 
03:56:23.570 --> 03:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
difference and bring our community
 
03:56:27.349 --> 03:56:27.359 align:start position:0%

I am here to support Senate Bill 272
 
03:57:07.610 --> 03:57:07.620 align:start position:0%
because I love and I trust my mom and my

dad they are my parents
 
03:57:12.889 --> 03:57:12.899 align:start position:0%
how could schools Keep information about
 
03:57:15.490 --> 03:57:15.500 align:start position:0%
any student when the parents
 
03:57:17.929 --> 03:57:17.939 align:start position:0%
specifically ask for it
 
03:57:20.150 --> 03:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's insane to me
 
03:57:23.630 --> 03:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
it's sad to watch all of this testimony
 
03:57:26.630 --> 03:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
teacher's main purpose is to teach like
 
03:57:29.150 --> 03:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
reading and writing and arithmetic

rights
 
03:57:33.469 --> 03:57:33.479 align:start position:0%
I know that when I was bullied in sixth
 
03:57:35.990 --> 03:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
grade at a public school none of those
 
03:57:38.570 --> 03:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
teachers nor administrators told my
 
03:57:40.969 --> 03:57:40.979 align:start position:0%
parents and I was bullied for many
 
03:57:40.979 --> 03:57:42.530 align:start position:0%
parents and I was bullied for many
months

03:57:42.530 --> 03:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
months
 
03:57:45.290 --> 03:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
one day I locked myself in a bathroom
 
03:57:48.469 --> 03:57:48.479 align:start position:0%
for about 45 minutes because a group of
 
03:57:51.229 --> 03:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
boys were harassing me and yet no one
 
03:57:54.290 --> 03:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
really cared until after all that time I
 
03:57:56.929 --> 03:57:56.939 align:start position:0%
was finally found and my mom did get a
 
03:57:59.630 --> 03:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
phone call from the school but yet guess
 
03:58:01.370 --> 03:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
what they didn't give her really any
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
much information until I had to tell my
 
03:58:04.080 --> 03:58:05.450 align:start position:0%
much information until I had to tell my
story

03:58:05.450 --> 03:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
story
 
03:58:09.229 --> 03:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
that was in 2019 at supposedly one of
 
03:58:12.229 --> 03:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
the best schools in the district
 
03:58:14.330 --> 03:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
this is why we need this spell coming
 
03:58:16.849 --> 03:58:16.859 align:start position:0%
from a very concerned teen who cares
 
03:58:19.309 --> 03:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
about all those other kids and teenagers
 
03:58:21.710 --> 03:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
I fully support this Bill thank you

this bill uses disingenuous language

about rights to conceal what appears to
 
03:59:15.710 --> 03:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
be another purpose to disparage and

dismantle public education and Educators
 
03:59:21.530 --> 03:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it takes what appears
 
03:59:23.809 --> 03:59:23.819 align:start position:0%
to be a suspicious stance about school
 
03:59:27.110 --> 03:59:27.120 align:start position:0%

misinformation about their ostensible
 
03:59:36.110 --> 03:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
motives and supposedly keeping

information about students from their

parents here's the truth
 
03:59:43.849 --> 03:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
in my 40 plus years experience with

03:59:51.830 --> 03:59:51.840 align:start position:0%

parents and families in my experience
 
04:00:03.170 --> 04:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
were always encouraged to learn more and

learning
 
04:00:09.110 --> 04:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
there are clear and open policies and
 
04:00:11.150 --> 04:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
procedures supporting the rights of
 
04:00:13.849 --> 04:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
parents to engage with teachers and
 
04:00:17.150 --> 04:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
administrators with school personnel and
 
04:00:18.950 --> 04:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
my fellow Chesterfield school board
 
04:00:21.769 --> 04:00:21.779 align:start position:0%
members take seriously
 
04:00:25.070 --> 04:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
ESPYs 272 has language about the rights
 
04:00:27.050 --> 04:00:27.060 align:start position:0%
of parents to learn about what students
 
04:00:29.410 --> 04:00:29.420 align:start position:0%
might confide
 
04:00:32.150 --> 04:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
confidentiality is a fundamental and
 
04:00:34.910 --> 04:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
critical right of all people including
 
04:00:37.790 --> 04:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
children and essential to effective
 
04:00:40.429 --> 04:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
Counseling in my experience which
 
04:00:42.290 --> 04:00:42.300 align:start position:0%
includes literally thousands of
 
04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
counseling sessions with school children
 
04:00:47.630 --> 04:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
there are relative handful of situations
 
04:00:50.389 --> 04:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
where students were not encouraged to
 
04:00:52.010 --> 04:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
involve their families
 
04:00:54.469 --> 04:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
however within that small minority of
 
04:00:57.469 --> 04:00:57.479 align:start position:0%
cases where at home stories of incest
 
04:01:00.290 --> 04:01:00.300 align:start position:0%
physical violence and rejection of
 
04:01:02.809 --> 04:01:02.819 align:start position:0%
students who were exploring gender and
 
04:01:05.750 --> 04:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
sexuality in those situations it could
 
04:01:08.689 --> 04:01:08.699 align:start position:0%
be literally dangerous were teachers and
 
04:01:11.450 --> 04:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
counselors to be mandated to reveal what
 
04:01:13.910 --> 04:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
was told to them in confidence this
 
04:01:16.670 --> 04:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
isn't a critical and Essential Best
 
04:01:20.269 --> 04:01:20.279 align:start position:0%
practice for educators in the real world
 
04:01:24.290 --> 04:01:24.300 align:start position:0%
SB 272 if implemented would actually put
 
04:01:26.929 --> 04:01:26.939 align:start position:0%
school children at risk for serious
 
04:01:29.750 --> 04:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
domestic harm it also will harm schools
 
04:01:31.809 --> 04:01:31.819 align:start position:0%
and the noble profession of teaching
 
04:01:34.429 --> 04:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
parents rights has become the term of
 
04:01:37.309 --> 04:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
choice for Nationwide efforts to censor
 
04:01:40.130 --> 04:01:40.140 align:start position:0%
School curricula banned books suppress
 
04:01:42.650 --> 04:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
the teaching of actual history and
 
04:01:44.389 --> 04:01:44.399 align:start position:0%

hello
 
04:02:10.189 --> 04:02:10.199 align:start position:0%
I'm Liam Romano I'm here to be the voice
 
04:02:13.070 --> 04:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
for two great Catholic and conservative
 
04:02:15.950 --> 04:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
parents who love their child who is
 
04:02:19.429 --> 04:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
transgender yes it's possible
 
04:02:22.130 --> 04:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
it's because the guidance counselor
 
04:02:25.250 --> 04:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
reached out to the mother after talking
 
04:02:28.729 --> 04:02:28.739 align:start position:0%
to the child in Middle School
 
04:02:30.830 --> 04:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
a meeting was held
 
04:02:34.790 --> 04:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
about what name they would use and they
 
04:02:36.050 --> 04:02:36.060 align:start position:0%
used a nickname
 
04:02:39.170 --> 04:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
so the child wouldn't be a all freaked
 
04:02:40.370 --> 04:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
out or upset
 
04:02:42.469 --> 04:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
and then they decided that the nurse's
 
04:02:44.150 --> 04:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
bathroom would be the appropriate place
 
04:02:47.090 --> 04:02:47.100 align:start position:0%
for this child during this time
 
04:02:50.750 --> 04:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
the parents bought appropriate clothes
 
04:02:53.210 --> 04:02:53.220 align:start position:0%
so that the child would not be in female
 
04:02:53.220 --> 04:02:54.830 align:start position:0%
so that the child would not be in female
attire

04:02:54.830 --> 04:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
attire
 
04:02:57.429 --> 04:02:57.439 align:start position:0%
and they also
 
04:03:00.650 --> 04:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
this child went through high school and
 
04:03:03.050 --> 04:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
was involved in extracurricular
 
04:03:06.290 --> 04:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
activities has great friends and a big
 
04:03:08.929 --> 04:03:08.939 align:start position:0%
support system his biggest supporters
 
04:03:13.130 --> 04:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
are his Catholic conservative parents
 
04:03:16.010 --> 04:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
this child's parents have gotten their
 
04:03:18.469 --> 04:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
child mental health support and Health
 
04:03:21.590 --> 04:03:21.600 align:start position:0%

04:03:23.929 --> 04:03:23.939 align:start position:0%
pushing off drastic measures until
 
04:03:23.939 --> 04:03:26.150 align:start position:0%
pushing off drastic measures until
adulthood

04:03:26.150 --> 04:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
adulthood
 
04:03:29.269 --> 04:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
all the while giving a voice to their
 
04:03:31.490 --> 04:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
child and talking about what's going on
 
04:03:34.969 --> 04:03:34.979 align:start position:0%
within their family
 
04:03:37.969 --> 04:03:37.979 align:start position:0%
I'm here to support the teachers that
 
04:03:40.429 --> 04:03:40.439 align:start position:0%
came forward to this
 
04:03:43.370 --> 04:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
this couple who were struggling with
 
04:03:45.830 --> 04:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
this and they did not want to come up
 
04:03:49.490 --> 04:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
and speak and out their child so these
 
04:03:52.010 --> 04:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
parents just want rights just like these
 
04:03:54.650 --> 04:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
transgender students I support this bill
 
04:03:57.290 --> 04:03:57.300 align:start position:0%
they support this bill you should all
 
04:03:59.870 --> 04:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
support this bill parents
 
04:04:02.990 --> 04:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
our parents and they birthed these
 
04:04:05.150 --> 04:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
children the state does not have any
 
04:04:06.769 --> 04:04:06.779 align:start position:0%
rights the schools do not have any
 
04:04:09.229 --> 04:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
rights teachers are there to teach
 
04:04:10.969 --> 04:04:10.979 align:start position:0%
it's great that they're speaking with
 
04:04:13.610 --> 04:04:13.620 align:start position:0%
these with these children and it's great
 
04:04:15.950 --> 04:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
that you know they have that ability to
 
04:04:18.650 --> 04:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
welcome any kind of conversation but the
 
04:04:20.330 --> 04:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
parents should be in the know they
 
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
really should
 
04:04:23.870 --> 04:04:23.880 align:start position:0%

04:04:27.349 --> 04:04:27.359 align:start position:0%

Claudia Estelle from Acworth I've taught
 
04:04:34.790 --> 04:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
in public high schools in New Hampshire
 
04:04:39.290 --> 04:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
for over 30 years and I speaking in
 
04:04:41.510 --> 04:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
04:04:43.969 --> 04:04:43.979 align:start position:0%
um I'm parent parents have rights I
 
04:04:46.969 --> 04:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
agree with that as a teacher I always
 
04:04:49.729 --> 04:04:49.739 align:start position:0%
felt that I was part of a team with the
 
04:04:52.189 --> 04:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
parents and the student and other
 
04:04:54.469 --> 04:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
professionals to work for the best of
 
04:04:57.290 --> 04:04:57.300 align:start position:0%
the child communication is a very very
 
04:05:00.950 --> 04:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
important it's always been part of the
 
04:05:03.349 --> 04:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
policy of all public schools that
 
04:05:05.990 --> 04:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
parents have access to the curriculum
 
04:05:08.269 --> 04:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
can come and ask questions can come
 
04:05:10.510 --> 04:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
visit the schools whenever they want to
 
04:05:14.689 --> 04:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
it was my duty to also communicate with
 
04:05:16.849 --> 04:05:16.859 align:start position:0%
the parents about the curriculum about
 
04:05:19.330 --> 04:05:19.340 align:start position:0%
their students progress
 
04:05:22.370 --> 04:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
but I do need to tell you and most of
 
04:05:24.889 --> 04:05:24.899 align:start position:0%
the time that worked very well I mean
 
04:05:26.450 --> 04:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
their parent-teacher conferences are all
 
04:05:29.630 --> 04:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
these their emails and so forth but I do
 
04:05:32.210 --> 04:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
want to tell you one story which was
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
very disturbing
 
04:05:34.319 --> 04:05:35.150 align:start position:0%
very disturbing
um

04:05:35.150 --> 04:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:37.610 --> 04:05:37.620 align:start position:0%
I had a student who was not working well
 
04:05:40.070 --> 04:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
she was her progress was deteriorating
 
04:05:41.870 --> 04:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
she wasn't completing homework she was
 
04:05:45.889 --> 04:05:45.899 align:start position:0%
withdrawn and I do what I usually do
 
04:05:48.830 --> 04:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
which is to call home and see if we can
 
04:05:52.429 --> 04:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
work as a team to help this child I left
 
04:05:54.590 --> 04:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
numbers of messages I didn't reach
 
04:05:57.290 --> 04:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
anybody no one got back to me one
 
04:05:59.570 --> 04:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
evening I called home and the father
 
04:06:02.809 --> 04:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
answered and the voice was so hard and
 
04:06:05.689 --> 04:06:05.699 align:start position:0%
so cold it reminded me of another parent
 
04:06:07.849 --> 04:06:07.859 align:start position:0%
that I had spoken to in a previous time
 
04:06:11.630 --> 04:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
in my career who had been an abusive
 
04:06:13.849 --> 04:06:13.859 align:start position:0%
so the next morning as soon as I got to
 
04:06:16.670 --> 04:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
school I I went to the administration
 
04:06:19.790 --> 04:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
and I said I'm worried that there might
 
04:06:21.950 --> 04:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
be abuse in this family that's my
 
04:06:25.090 --> 04:06:25.100 align:start position:0%
responsibility as a teacher to do that
 
04:06:27.290 --> 04:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
they said
 
04:06:30.050 --> 04:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
the a relative had just also called in
 
04:06:31.550 --> 04:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
saying that they were concerned about
 
04:06:34.189 --> 04:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
the same issue the child was pulled from
 
04:06:36.950 --> 04:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
school I never saw her again her parents
 
04:06:39.710 --> 04:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
took her out of the district and the
 
04:06:41.830 --> 04:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
rest of their family they moved away
 
04:06:45.229 --> 04:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
impeding any ability to have an
 
04:06:47.590 --> 04:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
investigation to follow through on this
 
04:06:50.330 --> 04:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
so in my
 
04:06:54.530 --> 04:06:54.540 align:start position:0%
innocence I guess my efforts to reach
 
04:06:56.750 --> 04:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
out to her parent who I would think
 
04:06:59.090 --> 04:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
would be her first protector I was
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
actually reaching her abuser
 
04:07:04.910 --> 04:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
and what I didn't know because she
 
04:07:07.189 --> 04:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
hadn't shared it with me undoubtedly
 
04:07:10.010 --> 04:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
made her life worse
 
04:07:12.530 --> 04:07:12.540 align:start position:0%
so too often children and teens suffer
 
04:07:14.330 --> 04:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
alone with their doubts and questions
 
04:07:16.849 --> 04:07:16.859 align:start position:0%
and concerns leading to anxiety poor
 
04:07:19.610 --> 04:07:19.620 align:start position:0%
social connection deteriorating academic

Desi and her mom

were people that
 
04:08:34.010 --> 04:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
um were in the system Desi was a foster
 
04:08:36.050 --> 04:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
child she grew up in the foster care
 
04:08:38.929 --> 04:08:38.939 align:start position:0%
system she went from home to home to
 
04:08:38.939 --> 04:08:40.210 align:start position:0%
system she went from home to home to
home

04:08:40.210 --> 04:08:40.220 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:08:43.849 --> 04:08:43.859 align:start position:0%
and I was her I was her one trusted
 
04:08:47.210 --> 04:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
person I was so excited when Desi came
 
04:08:49.910 --> 04:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
to me and said I think I'm in the wrong
 
04:08:52.610 --> 04:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
body I embraced that
 
04:08:57.290 --> 04:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
and I took that child to I I worked with
 
04:08:59.689 --> 04:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
the school I worked with mental health I
 
04:09:01.670 --> 04:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
worked with nami New Hampshire I worked
 
04:09:04.130 --> 04:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
with the national child Alliance and we
 
04:09:07.250 --> 04:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
were going to do everything we could to
 
04:09:13.130 --> 04:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:15.290 --> 04:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
at 16 years old
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
she chose to have a double mastectomy
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
she started questioning
 
04:09:24.110 --> 04:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
that maybe she'd made a mistake
 
04:09:26.269 --> 04:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
but she didn't come to us
 
04:09:31.010 --> 04:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:33.229 --> 04:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
and I found out
 
04:09:36.769 --> 04:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
because I was one trusted person
 
04:09:39.290 --> 04:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
I got the suicide note
 
04:09:43.610 --> 04:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
I only found out in Desi's death
 
04:09:47.330 --> 04:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
that the reason why she was feeling that
 
04:09:48.889 --> 04:09:48.899 align:start position:0%
she was
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
um she was experienced gender
 
04:09:53.870 --> 04:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know what it's agenda dysphoria
 
04:09:58.969 --> 04:09:58.979 align:start position:0%
was because her abuser her groomer was a
 
04:10:03.349 --> 04:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
school staff person that we all trusted
 
04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
and that's the bottom line it's not
 
04:10:09.650 --> 04:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
about any of us hating on any other
 
04:10:09.660 --> 04:10:10.729 align:start position:0%
about any of us hating on any other
human

04:10:10.729 --> 04:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
human
 
04:10:13.910 --> 04:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's not about any of us being righteous
 
04:10:13.920 --> 04:10:15.229 align:start position:0%
it's not about any of us being righteous
and

04:10:15.229 --> 04:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:10:19.370 --> 04:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
Wicked Christian or Wicked Wiccan or
 
04:10:19.380 --> 04:10:20.809 align:start position:0%
Wicked Christian or Wicked Wiccan or
whatever

04:10:20.809 --> 04:10:20.819 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:10:23.809 --> 04:10:23.819 align:start position:0%
there isn't a I worked for dcyf for over
 
04:10:28.490 --> 04:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
17 years and in those 17 years I had two
 
04:10:28.500 --> 04:10:30.950 align:start position:0%
17 years and in those 17 years I had two
parents

04:10:30.950 --> 04:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
parents
 
04:10:33.530 --> 04:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
that I can say that they had they
 
04:10:33.540 --> 04:10:35.030 align:start position:0%
that I can say that they had they
admitted

04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
admitted
 
04:10:36.650 --> 04:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
that they didn't love their children
 
04:10:39.170 --> 04:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
that they had their children through
 
04:10:41.689 --> 04:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
therapy and everything that they they
 
04:10:41.699 --> 04:10:44.630 align:start position:0%
therapy and everything that they they
reproduced

04:10:44.630 --> 04:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
reproduced
 
04:10:47.870 --> 04:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
because one of them had Munchausen by
 
04:10:47.880 --> 04:10:49.070 align:start position:0%
because one of them had Munchausen by
proxy

04:10:49.070 --> 04:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
proxy
 
04:10:50.929 --> 04:10:50.939 align:start position:0%
that parent had munchened house and by
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
proxy and the other said that she had
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
her child specifically so that that
 
04:10:58.250 --> 04:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
child could be used as sacrifice now in

04:11:13.189 --> 04:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:38.689 --> 04:11:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:38.699 --> 04:11:40.189 align:start position:0%
 
hello

04:11:40.189 --> 04:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
hello
 
04:11:41.929 --> 04:11:41.939 align:start position:0%
my name is Ariel
 
04:11:44.570 --> 04:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
I am a transgender woman and resident of
 
04:11:48.110 --> 04:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
Bo New Hampshire and I'm speaking an
 
04:11:50.710 --> 04:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
extreme opposition to this hateful Bill
 
04:11:54.410 --> 04:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
SB 272
 
04:11:57.650 --> 04:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
I have sat here all day listening to
 
04:12:00.950 --> 04:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
countless testimonies is from people or
 
04:12:03.110 --> 04:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
who have used our either extremely
 
04:12:06.710 --> 04:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
hateful or extremely misguided
 
04:12:09.530 --> 04:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
head what I'm gathering is that this
 
04:12:11.929 --> 04:12:11.939 align:start position:0%
isn't about protecting kids this is
 
04:12:13.610 --> 04:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
about controlling them this is about
 
04:12:17.030 --> 04:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
what Morgan them and to become whatever
 
04:12:22.490 --> 04:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:26.210 --> 04:12:26.220 align:start position:0%
I have met a lot of trans people in my
 
04:12:30.530 --> 04:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
life both adult and children and from my
 
04:12:32.269 --> 04:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
experience trans children know
 
04:12:35.210 --> 04:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
themselves better than any any other
 
04:12:37.729 --> 04:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
person possibly can
 
04:12:41.150 --> 04:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
and and I can speak as someone whose
 
04:12:44.150 --> 04:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
mother worked as a preschool teacher for
 
04:12:46.790 --> 04:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
several decades that her job is not just
 
04:12:49.610 --> 04:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
to quote teach reading and writing her
 
04:12:52.910 --> 04:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
job is to foster a safe space for
 
04:12:55.309 --> 04:12:55.319 align:start position:0%
children to experience love to
 
04:12:57.349 --> 04:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
experience kindness to experience
 
04:13:00.349 --> 04:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
compassion for others to experience a
 
04:13:03.050 --> 04:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
judgment-free Zone but most of all
 
04:13:06.889 --> 04:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
to establish trust with an adult who is
 
04:13:09.530 --> 04:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
not their parents now when we go around
 
04:13:13.630 --> 04:13:13.640 align:start position:0%
saying that I teachers can just go and
 
04:13:17.990 --> 04:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
abandon that trust us abandon a child's
 
04:13:21.050 --> 04:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
trust us and put their and put that
 
04:13:24.769 --> 04:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
child at risk for for any possible abuse
 
04:13:26.809 --> 04:13:26.819 align:start position:0%
or homelessness or even suicide for that
 
04:13:28.670 --> 04:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
matter because they don't know what
 
04:13:31.370 --> 04:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
their family life is like
 
04:13:34.849 --> 04:13:34.859 align:start position:0%
like I I I'm Sorry by failing to see how
 
04:13:39.830 --> 04:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:39.840 --> 04:13:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:13:43.250 --> 04:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:13:45.530 --> 04:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
it's frustrating that I have to come
 
04:13:49.550 --> 04:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
here here just to ask for my basic
 
04:13:53.809 --> 04:13:53.819 align:start position:0%
rights as a human being to be respected
 
04:13:55.670 --> 04:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
okay because people that I don't even
 
04:13:59.630 --> 04:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
know can't even see my worth
 
04:14:02.330 --> 04:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
and can't even see the worth of the
 
04:14:08.269 --> 04:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:22.210 --> 04:14:22.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:25.790 --> 04:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
Jenny yes thank you my name is Jenny
 
04:14:28.250 --> 04:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
Broderick I'm from Milford New Hampshire
 
04:14:32.269 --> 04:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
I am currently uh have been for the past
 
04:14:35.870 --> 04:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
20 years home educating my own children
 
04:14:35.880 --> 04:14:36.769 align:start position:0%
20 years home educating my own children
um

04:14:36.769 --> 04:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:40.010 --> 04:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
when I was in high school having
 
04:14:42.590 --> 04:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
experienced the high school world and
 
04:14:45.469 --> 04:14:45.479 align:start position:0%
kid culture is what it's called The
 
04:14:48.170 --> 04:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
Secret World of kids
 
04:14:51.170 --> 04:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
um I had decided that I didn't want my
 
04:14:54.170 --> 04:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
children to
 
04:14:54.180 --> 04:14:56.210 align:start position:0%
children to
um

04:14:56.210 --> 04:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:58.010 --> 04:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
to have to be separated from their
 
04:15:00.349 --> 04:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
parents in the sense of
 
04:15:02.689 --> 04:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
not having communication and those types
 
04:15:05.269 --> 04:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
of things so I chose from the time I was
 
04:15:06.650 --> 04:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
in high school I already knew that I
 
04:15:09.889 --> 04:15:09.899 align:start position:0%
would home educate my own children
 
04:15:09.899 --> 04:15:11.030 align:start position:0%
would home educate my own children
um

04:15:11.030 --> 04:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:13.849 --> 04:15:13.859 align:start position:0%
I have friends and family whoever do who
 
04:15:17.389 --> 04:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
do not home educate their own children
 
04:15:17.399 --> 04:15:18.050 align:start position:0%
do not home educate their own children
um

04:15:18.050 --> 04:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:21.050 --> 04:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
my concern my purpose for being here is
 
04:15:25.550 --> 04:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
not to control or to dominate A specific
 
04:15:27.950 --> 04:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
group of people or even a specific group
 
04:15:30.469 --> 04:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
of thoughts and feelings
 
04:15:33.889 --> 04:15:33.899 align:start position:0%
but my concerns are literally as a
 
04:15:33.899 --> 04:15:34.849 align:start position:0%
but my concerns are literally as a
parent

04:15:34.849 --> 04:15:34.859 align:start position:0%
parent
 
04:15:39.229 --> 04:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
that myself having the ability to
 
04:15:42.349 --> 04:15:42.359 align:start position:0%

taken in to get a Gardasil vaccine she

that point that her teachers had set up
 
04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:34.800 align:start position:0%

a month later
 
04:16:46.729 --> 04:16:46.739 align:start position:0%

extreme anxiety
 
04:16:51.590 --> 04:16:51.600 align:start position:0%

the world
 
04:17:07.309 --> 04:17:07.319 align:start position:0%

having such high anxiety a month after
 
04:17:11.870 --> 04:17:11.880 align:start position:0%

young mother she struggles taking care
 
04:17:23.090 --> 04:17:23.100 align:start position:0%

as an experienced public speaker elected

paragraph or even a sentence to explain
 
04:20:43.020 --> 04:20:44.809 align:start position:0%
paragraph or even a sentence to explain
why

04:20:44.809 --> 04:20:44.819 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:20:47.210 --> 04:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
however I didn't have any wiser reasons
 
04:20:49.550 --> 04:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
to give yet
 
04:20:52.550 --> 04:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
my parents love me I know this they told
 
04:20:55.969 --> 04:20:55.979 align:start position:0%
me every day of course they love me this
 
04:20:58.790 --> 04:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
love that fueled them to protect us a
 
04:21:00.530 --> 04:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
love so powerful they had to control
 
04:21:03.889 --> 04:21:03.899 align:start position:0%
their children and their environment
 
04:21:05.689 --> 04:21:05.699 align:start position:0%
an environment that was riddled with
 
04:21:09.050 --> 04:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
control authoritarianism and fear
 
04:21:10.670 --> 04:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
an environment that was filled with
 
04:21:14.269 --> 04:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
physical assault sexual abuse Cults and
 
04:21:16.429 --> 04:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
educational neglect
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
an environment and educational setting
 
04:21:22.870 --> 04:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
with explicit homophobia transphobia
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
sexism and racism
 
04:21:28.130 --> 04:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
in an environment that controlled every
 
04:21:30.950 --> 04:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
aspect of myself and by seven other
 
04:21:32.689 --> 04:21:32.699 align:start position:0%
siblings lives
 
04:21:35.689 --> 04:21:35.699 align:start position:0%
an environment with no Community for
 
04:21:38.689 --> 04:21:38.699 align:start position:0%
many years I have asked myself and my
 
04:21:40.490 --> 04:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
parents why
 
04:21:42.889 --> 04:21:42.899 align:start position:0%
my father and I regrets his actions and
 
04:21:45.590 --> 04:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
sees the harm caused we talk frequently
 
04:21:48.830 --> 04:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
we have grown I understand now that he
 
04:21:51.530 --> 04:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
was scared and as many of us are here in
 
04:21:53.389 --> 04:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
this room
 
04:21:56.389 --> 04:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
today Senator Carson along with others
 
04:21:58.550 --> 04:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
have repeatedly asked why
 
04:22:00.530 --> 04:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
stating that it's only about one thing
 
04:22:02.469 --> 04:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
and that parents love their children
 
04:22:05.090 --> 04:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
citing situations that are already
 
04:22:07.849 --> 04:22:07.859 align:start position:0%
addressed by state law including a
 
04:22:09.830 --> 04:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
parental Bill of Rights
 
04:22:12.889 --> 04:22:12.899 align:start position:0%
if it was only about a parental rights
 
04:22:15.110 --> 04:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
and love then why is the only thing
 
04:22:17.570 --> 04:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
different about this bill is that it
 
04:22:19.910 --> 04:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
calls out gender identity sexual
 
04:22:23.150 --> 04:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
orientation and transgender people
 
04:22:25.670 --> 04:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
as a child of parents fueled by love and
 
04:22:27.950 --> 04:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
protection only to control myself and my
 
04:22:30.650 --> 04:22:30.660 align:start position:0%
other seven siblings artistic expression
 
04:22:34.429 --> 04:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
was my only Outlet it remained so today
 
04:22:36.889 --> 04:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
so this is my message via poem to
 
04:22:40.309 --> 04:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson and representative of our
 
04:22:42.530 --> 04:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die state that seeks to
 
04:22:44.090 --> 04:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
04:22:46.010 --> 04:22:46.020 align:start position:0%

04:22:52.370 --> 04:22:52.380 align:start position:0%

04:23:35.150 --> 04:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
um I'll start off with just what I came
 
04:23:37.429 --> 04:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
up with that I would like to change 30
 
04:23:39.290 --> 04:23:39.300 align:start position:0%
times listening to people speak in this
 
04:23:39.300 --> 04:23:40.670 align:start position:0%
times listening to people speak in this
room

04:23:40.670 --> 04:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
room
 
04:23:43.189 --> 04:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
I work 10 plus years as a school
 
04:23:45.530 --> 04:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
psychologist in two large elementary
 
04:23:47.570 --> 04:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
schools in Massachusetts
 
04:23:50.990 --> 04:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
I've have a trans sister-in-law we've
 
04:23:53.090 --> 04:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
welcomed several trans people into our
 
04:23:56.210 --> 04:23:56.220 align:start position:0%
lives love everybody don't judge anyone
 
04:23:58.610 --> 04:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
that's how I approach raising my three
 
04:24:02.030 --> 04:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
children working with others
 
04:24:04.010 --> 04:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to really talk about
 
04:24:06.170 --> 04:24:06.180 align:start position:0%
my background so you can see where my
 
04:24:08.630 --> 04:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
stance comes from help two young
 
04:24:11.630 --> 04:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
students probably about 18 years ago
 
04:24:14.330 --> 04:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
little young kids that just didn't feel
 
04:24:16.490 --> 04:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
like they belonged in their body
 
04:24:19.250 --> 04:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
I did not work with them until I had
 
04:24:21.410 --> 04:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
parental permission
 
04:24:24.349 --> 04:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
as a school psychologist there's a chain
 
04:24:27.309 --> 04:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
you follow you need parental permission
 
04:24:30.290 --> 04:24:30.300 align:start position:0%
parents need to be involved we're here
 
04:24:33.410 --> 04:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
to work together as a team and I again
 
04:24:35.630 --> 04:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
I'll go off this now I listened in this
 
04:24:40.250 --> 04:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
room to so many eyes I I mean me this
 
04:24:44.090 --> 04:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
room is so charged with emotion and I
 
04:24:47.150 --> 04:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
get it everyone has a story but we have
 
04:24:51.110 --> 04:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
to be aware of how that affects us and a
 
04:24:52.849 --> 04:24:52.859 align:start position:0%
lot of people don't have the training to
 
04:24:54.830 --> 04:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
understand hey I'm a teacher I was
 
04:24:56.990 --> 04:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
trained for this again I love teachers I
 
04:24:58.910 --> 04:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
was asked by many to come here because
 
04:25:01.010 --> 04:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
they don't want to keep lies with
 
04:25:04.309 --> 04:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
families and they're not realizing
 
04:25:06.410 --> 04:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
they're bringing all their baggage to
 
04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
how they're dealing with that child as a
 
04:25:10.790 --> 04:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
psychologist I have Beyond a master's
 
04:25:13.370 --> 04:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
degree to understand take that all out
 
04:25:16.969 --> 04:25:16.979 align:start position:0%
look at it from a different lens so we
 
04:25:19.130 --> 04:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
have to really pull some of the emotion
 
04:25:22.910 --> 04:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
out and say how can we serve our
 
04:25:26.630 --> 04:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
students and that is with the family of
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
course there are kids that are going to
 
04:25:30.889 --> 04:25:30.899 align:start position:0%
be the exception but we do have
 
04:25:34.849 --> 04:25:34.859 align:start position:0%
other places to get them help we have to
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
focus on how to best educate our
 
04:25:40.030 --> 04:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
students we're the education committee
 
04:25:43.490 --> 04:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
secure kids that are comfortable because
 
04:25:45.670 --> 04:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
they have a team around them
 
04:25:49.610 --> 04:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
are the best educated the most able to
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
deal with this this is not just a trans
 
04:25:55.429 --> 04:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
bill it is let's come together work
 
04:25:58.370 --> 04:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
together just this week found out from
 
04:26:00.710 --> 04:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
my sophomore son hey Mom you know
 
04:26:02.450 --> 04:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
there's a lady at the high school I
 
04:26:04.070 --> 04:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
don't know what she's called but she's
 
04:26:06.349 --> 04:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
the lady you can go talk to about when
 
04:26:08.149 --> 04:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
you drink alcohol or do drugs and she
 
04:26:10.550 --> 04:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
won't tell your parents I was like well
 
04:26:12.050 --> 04:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
I mean and I'm a school I'm in this
 
04:26:14.630 --> 04:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
world of education and I'm like wow this
 
04:26:17.090 --> 04:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
is the kid's perception we won't tell
 
04:26:19.610 --> 04:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
your parents lie to your parents no way
 
04:26:23.090 --> 04:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
once you tell kids to lie anxiety stress
 
04:26:26.630 --> 04:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
pressure you mess them up royally so
 
04:26:28.550 --> 04:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening to my testimony
 
04:26:29.689 --> 04:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:26:37.610 --> 04:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:39.889 --> 04:26:39.899 align:start position:0%
hi a quick preference addressing an
 
04:26:42.349 --> 04:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
earlier speaker's comments teachers are
 
04:26:44.330 --> 04:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
actually leaving the profession because
 
04:26:46.910 --> 04:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
they are underpaid undervalued and
 
04:26:49.370 --> 04:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
overworked now back to my regularly
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
scheduled comments
 
04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman Ladd and members
 
04:26:54.889 --> 04:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
of the education committee my name is
 
04:26:56.990 --> 04:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
Michaela damater and I'm here today to
 
04:27:00.830 --> 04:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
speak against SB 272. I am the mom of
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
two children who attend public schools
 
04:27:04.550 --> 04:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
in our community and I have had the
 
04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
pleasure of regularly volunteering at my
 
04:27:08.750 --> 04:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
daughter's Elementary School I also
 
04:27:10.729 --> 04:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
serve as a member of the Dover School
 
04:27:13.250 --> 04:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
Board I want to be clear that I
 
04:27:16.070 --> 04:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
represent myself only today though my
 
04:27:18.410 --> 04:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
perspective is broadened and enriched by
 
04:27:20.149 --> 04:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
my time spent serving in this public
 
04:27:20.159 --> 04:27:21.229 align:start position:0%
my time spent serving in this public
office

04:27:21.229 --> 04:27:21.239 align:start position:0%
office
 
04:27:23.929 --> 04:27:23.939 align:start position:0%
like you I am tasked with evaluating and
 
04:27:25.729 --> 04:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
approving policies that govern the
 
04:27:28.309 --> 04:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
actions of the community I serve like
 
04:27:31.010 --> 04:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
you I need to consider the intent behind
 
04:27:33.229 --> 04:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
policies and the possible outcomes
 
04:27:36.410 --> 04:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
whether intended or unintended like you
 
04:27:39.649 --> 04:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
I take my job very seriously
 
04:27:42.170 --> 04:27:42.180 align:start position:0%
the Bill's sponsor repeatedly referenced
 
04:27:43.670 --> 04:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that parents love their
 
04:27:45.290 --> 04:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
children and want what's best for them
 
04:27:48.469 --> 04:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
of course they do I don't disagree what
 
04:27:50.570 --> 04:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
the senator failed to mention though is
 
04:27:52.849 --> 04:27:52.859 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of parents to talk to
 
04:27:55.370 --> 04:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
their children directly and Foster a
 
04:27:56.809 --> 04:27:56.819 align:start position:0%
home environment where their children
 
04:27:58.790 --> 04:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
feel safe to share details of their
 
04:27:58.800 --> 04:27:59.689 align:start position:0%
feel safe to share details of their
lives

04:27:59.689 --> 04:27:59.699 align:start position:0%
lives
 
04:28:01.610 --> 04:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
the question at hand today is whether
 
04:28:04.130 --> 04:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
schools should be forced by law to
 
04:28:06.889 --> 04:28:06.899 align:start position:0%
reveal a student's transgender status to
 
04:28:09.590 --> 04:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
parents even over the express objection
 
04:28:12.110 --> 04:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
of the students the decision you must
 
04:28:14.269 --> 04:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
make is whose rights matter more here
 
04:28:17.030 --> 04:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
the student's right to safely share
 
04:28:19.010 --> 04:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
information with a teacher that the
 
04:28:20.870 --> 04:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
student may not wish to immediately
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
disclose to parents or the parents right
 
04:28:26.330 --> 04:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
to compel a school to reveal information
 
04:28:28.729 --> 04:28:28.739 align:start position:0%
their children have not given permission
 
04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
to share
 
04:28:33.110 --> 04:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
at no time have a parent's rights to
 
04:28:35.809 --> 04:28:35.819 align:start position:0%
talk to their own kids ever been in
 
04:28:39.170 --> 04:28:39.180 align:start position:0%
question or at risk of being removed
 
04:28:40.969 --> 04:28:40.979 align:start position:0%
public schools are educating a student
 
04:28:43.070 --> 04:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
population that is increasingly burdened
 
04:28:45.410 --> 04:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
by mental health struggles I directly
 
04:28:47.630 --> 04:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
see and hear evidence of this every
 
04:28:49.550 --> 04:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
single week I'm volunteering in our
 
04:28:52.250 --> 04:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
schools I challenge anyone to find a
 
04:28:53.750 --> 04:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
teacher or administrator who would
 
04:28:56.149 --> 04:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
disagree with this teachers work very
 
04:28:58.070 --> 04:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
hard to establish a safe environment
 
04:29:00.229 --> 04:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
where learning can happen this bill
 
04:29:02.450 --> 04:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
removes a teacher's ability to provide a
 
04:29:04.429 --> 04:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
safe confidential space for their
 
04:29:06.469 --> 04:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
students who may disclose information
 
04:29:09.590 --> 04:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
about their sexual Journey this is the
 
04:29:11.990 --> 04:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence we must not
 
04:29:14.570 --> 04:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
ignore this bill assumes it is a
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
school's job to step into and force the
 
04:29:19.910 --> 04:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
conversations in Revelations parents and
 
04:29:21.410 --> 04:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
children should be having within their
 
04:29:23.689 --> 04:29:23.699 align:start position:0%
own homes at the right times for those
 
04:29:27.410 --> 04:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
family members I do not support SB 272
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
it takes away a school's ability to be a
 
04:29:32.510 --> 04:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
safe haven for students who may not be
 
04:29:34.550 --> 04:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
experiencing that same Comfort at home
 
04:29:37.309 --> 04:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
or who want to be in control your time
 
04:29:39.050 --> 04:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
is up thank you of when and how this
 
04:29:42.410 --> 04:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:51.110 --> 04:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'd just like to take a
 
04:29:55.130 --> 04:29:55.140 align:start position:0%

rights I'd like you to consider that

04:31:00.830 --> 04:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
went to public schools in the Conway
 
04:31:02.450 --> 04:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
School District at Pine Tree and at
 
04:31:02.460 --> 04:31:03.729 align:start position:0%
School District at Pine Tree and at
Kennett

04:31:03.729 --> 04:31:03.739 align:start position:0%
Kennett
 
04:31:06.889 --> 04:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you I very much believe
 
04:31:09.710 --> 04:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
in parental rights
 
04:31:12.229 --> 04:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
in the ability to be involved in their
 
04:31:12.239 --> 04:31:13.210 align:start position:0%
in the ability to be involved in their
school

04:31:13.210 --> 04:31:13.220 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
education plan with um
 
04:31:19.309 --> 04:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
the teachers in the school however I
 
04:31:22.189 --> 04:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
04:31:25.189 --> 04:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
with every fiber of my being
 
04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
I also believe that parents have a
 
04:31:30.769 --> 04:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
responsibility not just rights and as a
 
04:31:32.929 --> 04:31:32.939 align:start position:0%
someone with responsibilities that means
 
04:31:34.389 --> 04:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
you generate
 
04:31:38.149 --> 04:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
a family value that says everybody's
 
04:31:41.510 --> 04:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
welcome and that your truth is always
 
04:31:43.969 --> 04:31:43.979 align:start position:0%
welcome here and that you will be loved
 
04:31:46.910 --> 04:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
and supported regardless of who you are
 
04:31:50.510 --> 04:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
who you love who you hang out with
 
04:31:54.349 --> 04:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
so I oppose this we already do have
 
04:31:56.269 --> 04:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
rights as parents I know this because I
 
04:31:58.910 --> 04:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
raised three children for 17 years they
 
04:32:00.170 --> 04:32:00.180 align:start position:0%
were in the schools
 
04:32:03.229 --> 04:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
I volunteered in the schools I went to
 
04:32:05.450 --> 04:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
teacher parent meetings I went to open
 
04:32:08.630 --> 04:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
houses I spoke to my parents to other
 
04:32:12.590 --> 04:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
teachers via email phone and in person
 
04:32:15.769 --> 04:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
so I knew what was going on these rights
 
04:32:18.590 --> 04:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
already exist this is a thinly veiled
 
04:32:20.570 --> 04:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
attempt to create a chilling atmosphere
 
04:32:23.389 --> 04:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
which will drive transgender kids
 
04:32:27.050 --> 04:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
on the ground to a place that I existed
 
04:32:29.929 --> 04:32:29.939 align:start position:0%
back in the 1960s and 70s
 
04:32:34.370 --> 04:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
so I urge you to oppose this bill I
 
04:32:35.950 --> 04:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
think it is
 
04:32:40.250 --> 04:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
aimed at trans children and I there's
 
04:32:43.610 --> 04:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
enough anxiety depression and suicidal
 
04:32:45.410 --> 04:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
ideation homelessness among trans
 
04:32:48.410 --> 04:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
children that this will only add to that
 
04:32:48.420 --> 04:32:49.490 align:start position:0%
children that this will only add to that
problem

04:32:49.490 --> 04:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:32:52.610 --> 04:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:32:52.620 --> 04:32:54.290 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
Dr

04:32:54.290 --> 04:32:54.300 align:start position:0%
Dr
 
04:33:12.109 --> 04:33:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:12.119 --> 04:33:15.051 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:33:15.051 --> 04:33:15.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:18.230 --> 04:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
there's a carrier card it's Carrie yeah
 
04:33:21.709 --> 04:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
I'm Dr Kerry Mendoza from the foundation
 
04:33:24.830 --> 04:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
against intolerance and racism I'm the
 
04:33:28.730 --> 04:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
medical director uh of our medicine
 
04:33:30.349 --> 04:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
Division and I'm also an emergency
 
04:33:33.230 --> 04:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
medicine physician and I'm here
 
04:33:36.650 --> 04:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
um to speak for this this bill
 
04:33:36.660 --> 04:33:37.369 align:start position:0%
um to speak for this this bill
um

04:33:37.369 --> 04:33:37.379 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:39.890 --> 04:33:39.900 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that with
 
04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
the Mental Health crisis right now it's
 
04:33:44.631 --> 04:33:44.641 align:start position:0%
a very complicated what we're seeing
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
with the Trans Community is there's a
 
04:33:52.250 --> 04:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
new cohort of patients that seems to be
 
04:33:54.830 --> 04:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
caught up in a social contagion it's
 
04:33:56.510 --> 04:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
mostly young girls
 
04:33:59.750 --> 04:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing they have pre they have
 
04:34:01.670 --> 04:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of mental health disorders that
 
04:34:03.230 --> 04:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
then they're getting caught up in the
 
04:34:06.410 --> 04:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
medical community and schools hiding
 
04:34:06.420 --> 04:34:08.090 align:start position:0%
medical community and schools hiding
information

04:34:08.090 --> 04:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:34:11.209 --> 04:34:11.219 align:start position:0%
is really a medical intervention and
 
04:34:13.970 --> 04:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be done in schools
 
04:34:16.970 --> 04:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
um it's similar to say using the Pain
 
04:34:19.551 --> 04:34:19.561 align:start position:0%
Scale in schools if we said hey we want
 
04:34:23.689 --> 04:34:23.699 align:start position:0%
to find excuse me kids who may suffer
 
04:34:26.269 --> 04:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
later from Pain conditions and what if
 
04:34:29.209 --> 04:34:29.219 align:start position:0%
we do the Pain Scale in school it'd be
 
04:34:31.010 --> 04:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
similar to what happened with the opioid
 
04:34:33.769 --> 04:34:33.779 align:start position:0%
crisis so I feel very strongly that
 
04:34:36.769 --> 04:34:36.779 align:start position:0%
parents should be informed as to what's
 
04:34:39.709 --> 04:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
going on with their children and so I I
 
04:34:41.510 --> 04:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
really urge you to support this Bill
 
04:34:44.689 --> 04:34:44.699 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Carrie
 
04:34:58.189 --> 04:34:58.199 align:start position:0%

well you know
 
04:35:14.830 --> 04:35:14.840 align:start position:0%

okay

04:35:40.150 --> 04:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:35:43.551 --> 04:35:43.561 align:start position:0%
hope that doesn't cut into my time thank
 
04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman members of the committee
 
04:35:48.890 --> 04:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
my name is Jennifer Smith I am a retired
 
04:35:50.390 --> 04:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
medical physician
 
04:35:52.849 --> 04:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
I'm also a transgender woman
 
04:35:55.670 --> 04:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
and I really want to just kind of remind
 
04:35:59.029 --> 04:35:59.039 align:start position:0%
you about what a powerful emotion shame
 
04:35:59.039 --> 04:36:00.410 align:start position:0%
you about what a powerful emotion shame
is

04:36:00.410 --> 04:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:36:03.949 --> 04:36:03.959 align:start position:0%
and that parents often try to shame
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
their children into behaving the way
 
04:36:08.990 --> 04:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
they'd like them to behave
 
04:36:12.230 --> 04:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
well unfortunately
 
04:36:14.330 --> 04:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
some parents
 
04:36:19.070 --> 04:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
will try to shame lgbtq kids
 
04:36:22.310 --> 04:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
who may not yet know who they are I
 
04:36:25.070 --> 04:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
certainly didn't know but I had the Good
 
04:36:27.529 --> 04:36:27.539 align:start position:0%
Fortune of having
 
04:36:31.189 --> 04:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
family and community that was not into
 
04:36:33.230 --> 04:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
shame but in fact
 
04:36:35.990 --> 04:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
I learned in high school in a religious
 
04:36:38.570 --> 04:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
high school that I did have gay teachers
 
04:36:40.070 --> 04:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
and that they weren't ashamed of
 
04:36:40.080 --> 04:36:41.750 align:start position:0%
and that they weren't ashamed of
themselves

04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
04:36:45.230 --> 04:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
and that was critical although I do know
 
04:36:48.289 --> 04:36:48.299 align:start position:0%
from one of them who I spoke to quite a
 
04:36:48.299 --> 04:36:49.551 align:start position:0%
from one of them who I spoke to quite a
bit

04:36:49.551 --> 04:36:49.561 align:start position:0%
bit
 
04:36:52.010 --> 04:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
that another parent
 
04:36:54.590 --> 04:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
also of a gay kid
 
04:36:56.631 --> 04:36:56.641 align:start position:0%
had spent a lot of time trying to get
 
04:36:59.449 --> 04:36:59.459 align:start position:0%
one of these faculty members removed
 
04:37:01.189 --> 04:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
because they considered that person
 
04:37:04.609 --> 04:37:04.619 align:start position:0%
inappropriate that person was wonderful
 
04:37:06.529 --> 04:37:06.539 align:start position:0%
and not a threat
 
04:37:09.650 --> 04:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
in any way shape or form
 
04:37:13.369 --> 04:37:13.379 align:start position:0%
and I think when we send a message that
 
04:37:16.551 --> 04:37:16.561 align:start position:0%
it's okay to shame your kids
 
04:37:19.189 --> 04:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
to try to get them to be something
 
04:37:21.890 --> 04:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
different than they are and are
 
04:37:24.289 --> 04:37:24.299 align:start position:0%
beginning to understand I didn't truly
 
04:37:25.609 --> 04:37:25.619 align:start position:0%
understand myself
 
04:37:28.609 --> 04:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
because of the general culture of Shame
 
04:37:31.310 --> 04:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
around until I was
 
04:37:33.890 --> 04:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
around 40 and that took a lot of time
 
04:37:35.990 --> 04:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
from there
 
04:37:39.170 --> 04:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
and I don't think anyone in the school
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
system is ignoring bringing parents in
 
04:37:45.769 --> 04:37:45.779 align:start position:0%
when that's appropriate but if a child
 
04:37:45.779 --> 04:37:47.449 align:start position:0%
when that's appropriate but if a child
wants

04:37:47.449 --> 04:37:47.459 align:start position:0%
wants
 
04:37:52.070 --> 04:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
to talk with others in a club
 
04:37:57.470 --> 04:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
for lgbtq kids and their allies
 
04:37:59.810 --> 04:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
they're going to be reluctant to look
 
04:38:02.510 --> 04:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
for that support and try to help figure
 
04:38:04.010 --> 04:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
it out
 
04:38:06.170 --> 04:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
by the time you're in late middle school
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
and high school
 
04:38:10.250 --> 04:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
you really are what used to be
 
04:38:13.070 --> 04:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
considered an adult yeah you need to
 
04:38:15.470 --> 04:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
learn a lot more about the world but
 
04:38:18.650 --> 04:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
you're responsible for your own actions
 
04:38:21.170 --> 04:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
that's why the bar mitzvah is at 12 or
 
04:38:24.529 --> 04:38:24.539 align:start position:0%
13 but mitsu as well
 
04:38:28.551 --> 04:38:28.561 align:start position:0%
and I think it would do a lot of good to
 
04:38:31.310 --> 04:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
have this bill killed
 
04:38:34.010 --> 04:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
or maybe retained and worked on if you
 
04:38:36.410 --> 04:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
really think there is a way
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
to do this that is safe and won't
 
04:38:40.080 --> 04:38:41.570 align:start position:0%
to do this that is safe and won't
increase

04:38:41.570 --> 04:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:38:44.929 --> 04:38:44.939 align:start position:0%
isolation depression and potential more
 
04:38:47.209 --> 04:38:47.219 align:start position:0%
suicide and we have a suicide crisis
 
04:38:49.369 --> 04:38:49.379 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:38:51.590 --> 04:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
so please your time's up thank you
 
04:38:52.849 --> 04:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
04:38:57.650 --> 04:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:00.289 --> 04:39:00.299 align:start position:0%
not here
 
04:39:00.299 --> 04:39:02.810 align:start position:0%
not here
okay

04:39:02.810 --> 04:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:17.390 --> 04:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:19.250 --> 04:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
I think I'm the right person to follow
 
04:39:19.260 --> 04:39:21.769 align:start position:0%
I think I'm the right person to follow
Jennifer

04:39:21.769 --> 04:39:21.779 align:start position:0%
Jennifer
 
04:39:24.189 --> 04:39:24.199 align:start position:0%
I mean the other Jennifer
 
04:39:27.230 --> 04:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me speak today I
 
04:39:28.849 --> 04:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
just want to lift up the voices of
 
04:39:31.609 --> 04:39:31.619 align:start position:0%
everyone who has spoken a well-spoken in
 
04:39:35.570 --> 04:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
opposition to this cruel bill and I hope
 
04:39:38.570 --> 04:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
that you all as lawmakers can see
 
04:39:40.510 --> 04:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
through the sound and the fury
 
04:39:43.190 --> 04:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
signifying worse than nothing it's
 
04:39:44.868 --> 04:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
signifying fear
 
04:39:47.090 --> 04:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
fear leads to hate and that's what this
 
04:39:49.550 --> 04:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
is it smells like it it looks like it it
 
04:39:54.590 --> 04:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:58.070 --> 04:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
next speaker is
 
04:40:02.150 --> 04:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
Andy Bemis well I'm Katie Lennon okay
 
04:40:04.430 --> 04:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah then Andy Bemis
 
04:40:06.770 --> 04:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
and and I'm a d transitioner and I live
 
04:40:08.750 --> 04:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
in Lowell but I work worship and do
 
04:40:11.090 --> 04:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
business in Nashua and so I'm an active
 
04:40:13.010 --> 04:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
Community member of the 603 and I'm here
 
04:40:15.770 --> 04:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
in support of SB 272 today
 
04:40:17.570 --> 04:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
it's like many children and teens today
 
04:40:19.788 --> 04:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
I identified myself as transgender for
 
04:40:21.530 --> 04:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
years and when I started to feel
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
confused and ashamed about my developing
 
04:40:25.190 --> 04:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
body I asked everyone in my life to call
 
04:40:27.410 --> 04:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
me by a new name and use male pronouns
 
04:40:29.570 --> 04:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
to refer to me so in other words I went
 
04:40:31.250 --> 04:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
through a social transition from female
 
04:40:32.570 --> 04:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
to male
 
04:40:34.550 --> 04:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
everyone in my life immediately affirmed
 
04:40:36.110 --> 04:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
my new identity either out of full
 
04:40:37.788 --> 04:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
support for it or just to stay neutral
 
04:40:39.830 --> 04:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
and not cause any issues but the
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
constant affirmation both active and
 
04:40:43.550 --> 04:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
passive solidified me in my transgender
 
04:40:46.430 --> 04:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
identity no one meant to lock me into an
 
04:40:47.690 --> 04:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
identity that would later leave me
 
04:40:49.310 --> 04:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
broken or shamed and more confused than
 
04:40:51.050 --> 04:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
before they were really all just being
 
04:40:51.060 --> 04:40:52.010 align:start position:0%
before they were really all just being
nice

04:40:52.010 --> 04:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
nice
 
04:40:53.750 --> 04:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
but the social transition eventually
 
04:40:55.550 --> 04:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't enough and I soon felt I needed
 
04:40:57.350 --> 04:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
to take testosterone and when that
 
04:40:59.090 --> 04:40:59.100 align:start position:0%
wasn't enough I had a double mastectomy
 
04:41:01.070 --> 04:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
and when that still wasn't enough I had
 
04:41:02.630 --> 04:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
a total hysterectomy including the
 
04:41:05.208 --> 04:41:05.218 align:start position:0%
removal of my uterus cervix Fallopian
 
04:41:07.910 --> 04:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
tubes and both ovaries there's no point
 
04:41:09.230 --> 04:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
of contentment during a gender
 
04:41:11.330 --> 04:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
transition we get fleeting moments of
 
04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
euphoria But ultimately One Step leads
 
04:41:15.170 --> 04:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
straight into the next and I thought
 
04:41:16.670 --> 04:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
that in the end I could really become a
 
04:41:18.708 --> 04:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
man but all I became was immutilated and
 
04:41:20.868 --> 04:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
abused version of my old self
 
04:41:22.850 --> 04:41:22.860 align:start position:0%
social transition is a big deal and
 
04:41:24.288 --> 04:41:24.298 align:start position:0%
we're lying when we say that any of this
 
04:41:26.330 --> 04:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
is reversible this is a big decision
 
04:41:28.128 --> 04:41:28.138 align:start position:0%
with lifelong consequences and New
 
04:41:29.330 --> 04:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't even require that
 
04:41:31.610 --> 04:41:31.620 align:start position:0%
parents be involved if the roles of
 
04:41:32.810 --> 04:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
mother and father don't include
 
04:41:34.970 --> 04:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
authority over the emotional social and
 
04:41:36.890 --> 04:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
physical future of their children the
 
04:41:38.750 --> 04:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
roles no longer mean anything
 
04:41:40.788 --> 04:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
like me transgender identifying youth
 
04:41:42.530 --> 04:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
have a high risk for depression the
 
04:41:44.868 --> 04:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
Trevor Project which is an LGBT advocacy
 
04:41:48.530 --> 04:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
group reports that 45 of LGBT teens have
 
04:41:50.330 --> 04:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
seriously considered attempting suicide
 
04:41:51.770 --> 04:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
in the past year
 
04:41:53.390 --> 04:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
more than half of that number is
 
04:41:55.788 --> 04:41:55.798 align:start position:0%
transgender identifying youth teachers
 
04:41:57.410 --> 04:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
and school administrators are mandated
 
04:41:59.628 --> 04:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
reporters and if a child suspected to be
 
04:42:01.368 --> 04:42:01.378 align:start position:0%
four times more likely to attempt
 
04:42:03.050 --> 04:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
suicide than the other students his age
 
04:42:05.448 --> 04:42:05.458 align:start position:0%
his parents have a right to know and SB
 
04:42:07.190 --> 04:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
272 will ensure that parents are
 
04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
notified if their children are
 
04:42:10.010 --> 04:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
identifying with a high-risk community
 
04:42:12.170 --> 04:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
and will allow the parents to decide the
 
04:42:14.030 --> 04:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
next best step for their child please
 
04:42:16.788 --> 04:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
vote in support of SB 272 and I'm happy
 
04:42:19.910 --> 04:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you
 
04:42:23.930 --> 04:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:29.170 --> 04:42:29.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:31.628 --> 04:42:31.638 align:start position:0%
my name is Andy and I live in Concord
 
04:42:34.670 --> 04:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to this bill which frames
 
04:42:36.288 --> 04:42:36.298 align:start position:0%
situations that most of us would
 
04:42:38.090 --> 04:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
consider gray areas in strictly black
 
04:42:39.708 --> 04:42:39.718 align:start position:0%
and white terms
 
04:42:41.448 --> 04:42:41.458 align:start position:0%
I have two kids who are in the mvsd
 
04:42:43.730 --> 04:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
school district it's a little redundancy
 
04:42:46.190 --> 04:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
if I learned that my kids schools were
 
04:42:47.990 --> 04:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
reserving information from me because
 
04:42:49.730 --> 04:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
they were about my kids because they
 
04:42:52.670 --> 04:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
were concerned for my kids safety I'd
 
04:42:55.010 --> 04:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
first consider whether I might have said
 
04:42:57.288 --> 04:42:57.298 align:start position:0%
or done something to raise a concern
 
04:42:58.850 --> 04:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
in any case I wouldn't worry about
 
04:43:00.650 --> 04:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
whether my kid was trans gay or
 
04:43:03.050 --> 04:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
otherwise different because lgbtq kids
 
04:43:05.090 --> 04:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
are beautiful and brave and should be
 
04:43:07.128 --> 04:43:07.138 align:start position:0%
loved celebrated and supported that's
 
04:43:08.150 --> 04:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
the most important thing I have to say
 
04:43:10.310 --> 04:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
today if any kids hear hear that you are
 
04:43:11.690 --> 04:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
beautiful and by the way since it came
 
04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
out if you are a child with autism you
 
04:43:16.670 --> 04:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
are beautiful and wonderful and perfect
 
04:43:18.110 --> 04:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't worry about what would happen
 
04:43:19.850 --> 04:43:19.860 align:start position:0%
if my kids changed their minds my kids
 
04:43:21.170 --> 04:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
have changed their minds about ways they
 
04:43:23.390 --> 04:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
used to identify the only irreversible
 
04:43:25.070 --> 04:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
effect is that they know themselves a
 
04:43:26.208 --> 04:43:26.218 align:start position:0%
little better
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
if a teacher was legally compelled to
 
04:43:29.270 --> 04:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
tell you your kid is using different
 
04:43:31.910 --> 04:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
pronouns what would you do for them
 
04:43:33.708 --> 04:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
if you take them to a therapist and that
 
04:43:35.750 --> 04:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
therapist says recommends gender
 
04:43:38.150 --> 04:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
affirming care as the vast majority of
 
04:43:39.830 --> 04:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
doctors in this country would do you
 
04:43:41.330 --> 04:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
listen to that doctor
 
04:43:43.670 --> 04:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
do you truly want your child to be happy
 
04:43:45.650 --> 04:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
or you do you just want them to be
 
04:43:45.660 --> 04:43:47.270 align:start position:0%
or you do you just want them to be
normal

04:43:47.270 --> 04:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
normal
 
04:43:49.490 --> 04:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
all children should feel safe and loved
 
04:43:51.288 --> 04:43:51.298 align:start position:0%
for being themselves that is our
 
04:43:52.670 --> 04:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility someone else said this
 
04:43:54.410 --> 04:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
but I have heard so much about parents
 
04:43:55.788 --> 04:43:55.798 align:start position:0%
rights and so little about our
 
04:43:58.368 --> 04:43:58.378 align:start position:0%
responsibilities Allah can't make our
 
04:44:00.830 --> 04:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
kids trust us or teach empathy that is
 
04:44:02.750 --> 04:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
our job
 
04:44:05.270 --> 04:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
when I attended a hearing for hb10 last
 
04:44:07.010 --> 04:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
month one of the Bill's supporters
 
04:44:09.410 --> 04:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
threatened me with sexual assault I
 
04:44:10.970 --> 04:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
later learned that another speaker a
 
04:44:13.250 --> 04:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
self-described d-transitioner is a
 
04:44:15.110 --> 04:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
registered and admitted sexual offender
 
04:44:17.030 --> 04:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
and this morning members of white
 
04:44:19.310 --> 04:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
nationalist groups stood outside in
 
04:44:20.570 --> 04:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
support of this bill because I guess
 
04:44:22.490 --> 04:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
white nationalists are so concerned with
 
04:44:24.708 --> 04:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
parents rights I heard a great deal then
 
04:44:27.170 --> 04:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
today about the powerful lgbtq movement
 
04:44:28.970 --> 04:44:28.980 align:start position:0%
to indoctrinate children with a radical
 
04:44:31.368 --> 04:44:31.378 align:start position:0%
ideological agenda here's my agenda all
 
04:44:33.470 --> 04:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
kids should feel safe loved and free to
 
04:44:36.110 --> 04:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
be themselves of course this bill is one
 
04:44:39.470 --> 04:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
of almost 500 targeting lgbtq plus kids
 
04:44:41.750 --> 04:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the country right now and though we
 
04:44:43.550 --> 04:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
make up a relatively small percentage of
 
04:44:45.350 --> 04:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
the population trans and non-binary
 
04:44:47.208 --> 04:44:47.218 align:start position:0%
people get a disproportionate amount of
 
04:44:49.690 --> 04:44:49.700 align:start position:0%
attention a Media Matters study from
 
04:44:53.090 --> 04:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
2021 found that over 60 percent of the
 
04:44:55.368 --> 04:44:55.378 align:start position:0%
discussion on Facebook related to trans
 
04:44:58.850 --> 04:44:58.860 align:start position:0%

04:45:31.190 --> 04:45:31.200 align:start position:0%

room and it's I've really soaked it up
 
04:45:50.150 --> 04:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
like a sponge as I'm hearing a lot of
 
04:45:54.110 --> 04:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
what ifs and fear I appreciate all
 
04:45:56.330 --> 04:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
teachers that are in school and what
 
04:45:59.030 --> 04:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
they do for kids when I was in school
 
04:46:03.530 --> 04:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
years ago the the role between the
 
04:46:06.170 --> 04:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
parents and the teacher was so important
 
04:46:08.330 --> 04:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
when there was something wrong with me
 
04:46:11.930 --> 04:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
in school I did go to a teacher or who I
 
04:46:15.230 --> 04:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
needed to to share like hey I I need to
 
04:46:16.310 --> 04:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
talk to somebody I'm not really sure
 
04:46:19.070 --> 04:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
about going to my mom but they worked
 
04:46:21.890 --> 04:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
with me and they allowed me to fix
 
04:46:24.590 --> 04:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
things with my mother and my mother was
 
04:46:27.530 --> 04:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
appreciative as a single parent to know
 
04:46:30.530 --> 04:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
something was going on with her kid
 
04:46:33.230 --> 04:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that they want to that there's
 
04:46:35.270 --> 04:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
several and hey you guys can have your
 
04:46:37.250 --> 04:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
own opinion you guys over here can have
 
04:46:40.190 --> 04:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
your own opinion I feel that we are
 
04:46:43.610 --> 04:46:43.620 align:start position:0%
being misled in this whole bill it seems
 
04:46:46.850 --> 04:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
to be that we are focused on one
 
04:46:50.990 --> 04:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
particular group we are not I am a
 
04:46:53.990 --> 04:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
parent who wants to know when there is
 
04:46:56.690 --> 04:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
something wrong with my child I don't
 
04:46:59.750 --> 04:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
care if they stub their toe or fall up
 
04:47:02.690 --> 04:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
the stairs in school or fall down the
 
04:47:02.700 --> 04:47:03.708 align:start position:0%
the stairs in school or fall down the
stairs

04:47:03.708 --> 04:47:03.718 align:start position:0%
stairs
 
04:47:06.470 --> 04:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
the thing that I'm hearing a lot about
 
04:47:09.708 --> 04:47:09.718 align:start position:0%
is parents have rights already there's
 
04:47:13.128 --> 04:47:13.138 align:start position:0%
plenty of laws for them they find out
 
04:47:16.368 --> 04:47:16.378 align:start position:0%
plenty um they they know everything they
 
04:47:19.970 --> 04:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
need to know what I am hearing is that
 
04:47:22.850 --> 04:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
there's one particular thing that needs
 
04:47:26.930 --> 04:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
to be kept out of the parents no and
 
04:47:30.010 --> 04:47:30.020 align:start position:0%
that is their sexual connotation
 
04:47:33.470 --> 04:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
why is that I come from a school
 
04:47:37.610 --> 04:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
district that is very controversial we
 
04:47:40.670 --> 04:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
are all over the news and I applaud a
 
04:47:42.350 --> 04:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
lot of teachers believe me I have
 
04:47:44.628 --> 04:47:44.638 align:start position:0%
friends who are teachers all over the
 
04:47:47.628 --> 04:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
country and they don't like that they
 
04:47:51.770 --> 04:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
have to keep secrets from parents that's
 
04:47:53.868 --> 04:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about folks we're
 
04:47:56.930 --> 04:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
talking about secrecy when there is
 
04:47:59.150 --> 04:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
someone who is abused a child in
 
04:48:01.128 --> 04:48:01.138 align:start position:0%
particular if they are mentally sexually
 
04:48:03.288 --> 04:48:03.298 align:start position:0%
or physically abused
 
04:48:06.770 --> 04:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
they keep that Secrets they're told by
 
04:48:09.530 --> 04:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
their abuser to keep that secret
 
04:48:12.350 --> 04:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
why are we asking teachers to keep
 
04:48:16.128 --> 04:48:16.138 align:start position:0%
secrets from their parents we have a
 
04:48:20.090 --> 04:48:20.100 align:start position:0%
teacher who is a person that someone can
 
04:48:23.448 --> 04:48:23.458 align:start position:0%
go to Just pled guilty your time is up
 
04:48:25.970 --> 04:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
04:48:31.610 --> 04:48:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:33.650 --> 04:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
thank you you know I was really supposed
 
04:48:35.330 --> 04:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
to be one of the first
 
04:48:38.208 --> 04:48:38.218 align:start position:0%
but they wanted to save all those cards
 
04:48:40.550 --> 04:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
for other people well
 
04:48:43.910 --> 04:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
um so you already have my notes maybe at
 
04:48:45.530 --> 04:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
the bottom of your pile it's the paper
 
04:48:48.530 --> 04:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
that has William Shakespeare in the top
 
04:48:51.470 --> 04:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
right corner holding a pen instead of a
 
04:48:51.480 --> 04:48:53.030 align:start position:0%
right corner holding a pen instead of a
sword

04:48:53.030 --> 04:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
sword
 
04:48:57.770 --> 04:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
so I have been a teacher for 40 years
 
04:48:59.930 --> 04:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:49:05.390 --> 04:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
but now I'm out and I mean out of school
 
04:49:07.490 --> 04:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
I want to say I'm here to present the
 
04:49:13.250 --> 04:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
rare case when Democrats and Republicans
 
04:49:13.260 --> 04:49:14.448 align:start position:0%
rare case when Democrats and Republicans
agree

04:49:14.448 --> 04:49:14.458 align:start position:0%
agree
 
04:49:18.410 --> 04:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
I saw it by accident uh recently I was
 
04:49:21.470 --> 04:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
watching a one-year-old Senate session a
 
04:49:23.330 --> 04:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
full session
 
04:49:26.990 --> 04:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
and they were debating the 100 million
 
04:49:29.750 --> 04:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
dollar fund for the victims of child
 
04:49:29.760 --> 04:49:31.610 align:start position:0%
dollar fund for the victims of child
abuse

04:49:31.610 --> 04:49:31.620 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
04:49:36.650 --> 04:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
and at the 5 Hour 34 Minute Mark our
 
04:49:39.230 --> 04:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
Democratic senator Whitley began
 
04:49:43.128 --> 04:49:43.138 align:start position:0%
describing the quote horrific abuse the
 
04:49:44.868 --> 04:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
stuff of nightmares
 
04:49:48.708 --> 04:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
kids subjected to indecent exposures
 
04:49:52.368 --> 04:49:52.378 align:start position:0%
being forced to watch unquote
 
04:49:55.550 --> 04:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
and then Senators Lou D'Alessandro and
 
04:49:59.030 --> 04:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
Waters echoed her disgust stating that
 
04:50:01.550 --> 04:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
no amount of money can wipe away the
 
04:50:03.948 --> 04:50:03.958 align:start position:0%
scars from these abuses
 
04:50:06.110 --> 04:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
the only disagreement between the right
 
04:50:08.270 --> 04:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
and the left was that the Democrats
 
04:50:12.050 --> 04:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
wanted more than the 100 million for the
 
04:50:12.060 --> 04:50:13.368 align:start position:0%
wanted more than the 100 million for the
victims

04:50:13.368 --> 04:50:13.378 align:start position:0%
victims
 
04:50:16.430 --> 04:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley stated the reason
 
04:50:19.190 --> 04:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
that these children were able to be
 
04:50:23.690 --> 04:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
abused was there was she said there was
 
04:50:27.050 --> 04:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
no parental involvement or they had no
 
04:50:27.060 --> 04:50:29.810 align:start position:0%
no parental involvement or they had no
parents

04:50:29.810 --> 04:50:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:33.230 --> 04:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
we can all agree that's why the kids
 
04:50:35.470 --> 04:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
were abused
 
04:50:38.448 --> 04:50:38.458 align:start position:0%
and what Senator wetley described is
 
04:50:40.310 --> 04:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
currently going on in our state-run
 
04:50:43.070 --> 04:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
schools and libraries and that gentleman
 
04:50:45.948 --> 04:50:45.958 align:start position:0%
Mr Richards from over there I felt very
 
04:50:48.410 --> 04:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
embarrassed that he had to say those
 
04:50:51.590 --> 04:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
things going on you know some people
 
04:50:54.470 --> 04:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
will say oh that's agent appropriate for
 
04:50:57.948 --> 04:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
kids I'm 69 and it's still inappropriate
 
04:51:00.110 --> 04:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
for me to have to hear that stuff or for
 
04:51:02.208 --> 04:51:02.218 align:start position:0%
him to say it
 
04:51:04.788 --> 04:51:04.798 align:start position:0%

04:53:17.390 --> 04:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
families
 
04:53:20.150 --> 04:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
students and names their nicknames their
 
04:53:22.788 --> 04:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
pronouns and the clubs that they are in
 
04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
are personal information if we're
 
04:53:28.730 --> 04:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
required to disclose those we are
 
04:53:32.208 --> 04:53:32.218 align:start position:0%
breaking our code of ethics
 
04:53:34.128 --> 04:53:34.138 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct for New Hampshire
 
04:53:38.330 --> 04:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
Educators among other things says
 
04:53:41.390 --> 04:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
in fulfilling responsibility to students
 
04:53:43.670 --> 04:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
a credential holder shall maintain a
 
04:53:45.288 --> 04:53:45.298 align:start position:0%
professional relationship with all
 
04:53:47.750 --> 04:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
students both inside and outside the
 
04:53:50.330 --> 04:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
educational setting and make reasonable
 
04:53:53.270 --> 04:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
efforts to protect students from
 
04:53:56.208 --> 04:53:56.218 align:start position:0%
conditions which are harmful to their
 
04:53:58.150 --> 04:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
health and safety
 
04:54:01.128 --> 04:54:01.138 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it is a reality that for
 
04:54:04.788 --> 04:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
some students being outed will cause
 
04:54:08.930 --> 04:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
them harm to their health and safety
 
04:54:10.850 --> 04:54:10.860 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote against this bill
 
04:54:13.730 --> 04:54:13.740 align:start position:0%
please do not make us violate our
 
04:54:15.590 --> 04:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
students privacy
 
04:54:19.550 --> 04:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
please do not ask us do not force us to
 
04:54:21.590 --> 04:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
compromise our students health and
 
04:54:21.600 --> 04:54:22.910 align:start position:0%
compromise our students health and
safety

04:54:22.910 --> 04:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
safety
 
04:54:25.310 --> 04:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
do not pass this bill that would require
 
04:54:27.350 --> 04:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
us to break our code of ethics and code
 
04:54:30.288 --> 04:54:30.298 align:start position:0%
of conduct thank you thank you very much
 
04:54:33.650 --> 04:54:33.660 align:start position:0%

04:54:53.208 --> 04:54:53.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:55.250 --> 04:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:54:57.070 --> 04:54:57.080 align:start position:0%
my name is Walt Stapleton I'm
 
04:54:59.150 --> 04:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
representative of Sullivan County
 
04:55:00.770 --> 04:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
District Six
 
04:55:04.910 --> 04:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:08.628 --> 04:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of pro and con today
 
04:55:11.270 --> 04:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
and you know there is a growing divide
 
04:55:13.250 --> 04:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
in our culture
 
04:55:15.530 --> 04:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
that is evolving into a Chasm of
 
04:55:19.610 --> 04:55:19.620 align:start position:0%
dichotomy and controversy
 
04:55:23.270 --> 04:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
in other words always versus new ways
 
04:55:25.310 --> 04:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
rights of personal
 
04:55:27.708 --> 04:55:27.718 align:start position:0%
choices and rights versus Community
 
04:55:32.570 --> 04:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:36.230 --> 04:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
left unaddressed those that Gap will
 
04:55:38.990 --> 04:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
only widen
 
04:55:41.810 --> 04:55:41.820 align:start position:0%
I have a little different viewpoint
 
04:55:41.820 --> 04:55:44.390 align:start position:0%
I have a little different viewpoint
today

04:55:44.390 --> 04:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:46.970 --> 04:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
this bill is a mandate for parents
 
04:55:51.350 --> 04:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
teachers and schools to communicate
 
04:55:53.570 --> 04:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
and work together for the sake of the
 
04:55:53.580 --> 04:55:54.948 align:start position:0%
and work together for the sake of the
child

04:55:54.948 --> 04:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
child
 
04:55:56.930 --> 04:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
what we've been describing here is a
 
04:55:59.810 --> 04:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
great lack of communication
 
04:56:02.990 --> 04:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
wall of obfuscation
 
04:56:05.448 --> 04:56:05.458 align:start position:0%
that's not serving the children
 
04:56:08.750 --> 04:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
and that's our first Focus
 
04:56:12.830 --> 04:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
in any situation of stress for a child
 
04:56:14.930 --> 04:56:14.940 align:start position:0%
we have to communicate so that that
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't worsen into depression isolation
 
04:56:22.788 --> 04:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:25.250 --> 04:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
so again this is a mandate for
 
04:56:25.260 --> 04:56:26.990 align:start position:0%
so again this is a mandate for
communication

04:56:26.990 --> 04:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
communication
 
04:56:29.868 --> 04:56:29.878 align:start position:0%
for these divisions to come instead
 
04:56:29.878 --> 04:56:31.368 align:start position:0%
for these divisions to come instead
together

04:56:31.368 --> 04:56:31.378 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:56:33.650 --> 04:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
and communicate to one another
 
04:56:37.010 --> 04:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
parents to teachers teachers to parents
 
04:56:40.850 --> 04:56:40.860 align:start position:0%
so please support this bill as a way for
 
04:56:44.650 --> 04:56:44.660 align:start position:0%
better communication thank you thank you
 
04:56:53.510 --> 04:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:54.890 --> 04:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
04:56:57.050 --> 04:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and members of the
 
04:56:59.628 --> 04:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
education committee for your wrapped
 
04:57:02.650 --> 04:57:02.660 align:start position:0%
patient and considerate attention
 
04:57:06.288 --> 04:57:06.298 align:start position:0%
I am a resident of Concord and I was
 
04:57:09.288 --> 04:57:09.298 align:start position:0%
privileged to be a 30-year 33-year
 
04:57:11.628 --> 04:57:11.638 align:start position:0%
employee of the New Hampshire judicial
 
04:57:15.230 --> 04:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
branch where we handled thousands of
 
04:57:17.270 --> 04:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect cases over the course
 
04:57:19.730 --> 04:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
of my career
 
04:57:21.890 --> 04:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
most of the people certainly most of the
 
04:57:23.570 --> 04:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
people in this room and actually most
 
04:57:25.788 --> 04:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
people who have children
 
04:57:28.970 --> 04:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
truly care for their children love them
 
04:57:32.090 --> 04:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
and are gentle and kind
 
04:57:34.310 --> 04:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
and those families are probably the
 
04:57:36.650 --> 04:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
kinds of families where children will
 
04:57:39.230 --> 04:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately feel comfortable sharing
 
04:57:41.390 --> 04:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
their journey through their sexual
 
04:57:41.400 --> 04:57:42.890 align:start position:0%
their journey through their sexual
identity

04:57:42.890 --> 04:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
identity
 
04:57:45.708 --> 04:57:45.718 align:start position:0%
but I am here to remind you
 
04:57:49.250 --> 04:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of homes there are
 
04:57:52.310 --> 04:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
some homes not the majority that are
 
04:57:52.320 --> 04:57:53.930 align:start position:0%
some homes not the majority that are
abusive

04:57:53.930 --> 04:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
abusive
 
04:57:56.448 --> 04:57:56.458 align:start position:0%
and the children in those homes are
 
04:58:00.350 --> 04:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
fearful they do not have the liberty of
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
coming out and speaking to their parents
 
04:58:06.890 --> 04:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
they are scared
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
they depend on us
 
04:58:11.510 --> 04:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
they depend on you
 
04:58:14.150 --> 04:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
you will never know who they are
 
04:58:16.190 --> 04:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
you will never know
 
04:58:19.550 --> 04:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
their pain if they experience profound
 
04:58:21.948 --> 04:58:21.958 align:start position:0%
rejection from their families
 
04:58:24.708 --> 04:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
you will not see the connection
 
04:58:27.470 --> 04:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
if they commit suicide
 
04:58:29.390 --> 04:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
it would be perverse
 
04:58:32.868 --> 04:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
to require our teachers in this state to
 
04:58:35.570 --> 04:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
report suspicions of child abuse to the
 
04:58:35.580 --> 04:58:37.128 align:start position:0%
report suspicions of child abuse to the
abuser

04:58:37.128 --> 04:58:37.138 align:start position:0%
abuser
 
04:58:39.350 --> 04:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
this is no different
 
04:58:42.170 --> 04:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
please protect the children you do not
 
04:58:43.850 --> 04:58:43.860 align:start position:0%
see thank you
 
04:58:45.110 --> 04:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:58:52.670 --> 04:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:08.390 --> 04:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:08.400 --> 04:59:10.368 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

04:59:10.368 --> 04:59:10.378 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
04:59:11.810 --> 04:59:11.820 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
04:59:13.610 --> 04:59:13.620 align:start position:0%
my name is Chloe Cole and I speak in
 
04:59:14.810 --> 04:59:14.820 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill
 
04:59:16.670 --> 04:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
I come to you today because our most
 
04:59:18.530 --> 04:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
vulnerable are being targeted by an
 
04:59:20.990 --> 04:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
Insidious ideology that is silently and
 
04:59:22.610 --> 04:59:22.620 align:start position:0%
slowly propagated throughout much of
 
04:59:24.350 --> 04:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
Western culture
 
04:59:26.750 --> 04:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
I fell victim to this ideology when I
 
04:59:28.128 --> 04:59:28.138 align:start position:0%
was only 12 years old
 
04:59:29.868 --> 04:59:29.878 align:start position:0%
the effects of which how wreaked havoc
 
04:59:32.150 --> 04:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
on my on my entire body and I'm still
 
04:59:34.430 --> 04:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
feeling the damage today and I will for
 
04:59:36.350 --> 04:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
as long as I live
 
04:59:38.390 --> 04:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
this has become this is because I am a d
 
04:59:40.788 --> 04:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
transitioner a former transgender child
 
04:59:42.708 --> 04:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
who has been through the medical
 
04:59:45.350 --> 04:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
transition process not quite unlike the
 
04:59:47.208 --> 04:59:47.218 align:start position:0%
trans kids that radical trans activists
 
04:59:48.470 --> 04:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
are trying to create
 
04:59:50.810 --> 04:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
I was fast tracked by doctors who
 
04:59:52.310 --> 04:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
behaved more like abusers and meet
 
04:59:54.708 --> 04:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
butchers than medical professionals and
 
04:59:57.110 --> 04:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
do medical transitions into medical into
 
04:59:59.628 --> 04:59:59.638 align:start position:0%
a medical transition starting at 13 when
 
05:00:01.250 --> 05:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
I was given puberty suppressants and
 
05:00:03.350 --> 05:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
cross-sex hormones before they took my
 
05:00:05.868 --> 05:00:05.878 align:start position:0%
breasts away from me at 15 years old
 
05:00:07.610 --> 05:00:07.620 align:start position:0%
I don't know the status of my fertility
 
05:00:11.090 --> 05:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I can carry the term I
 
05:00:12.770 --> 05:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
don't know how many years this has taken
 
05:00:15.770 --> 05:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
off of my life I have no idea because
 
05:00:17.390 --> 05:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
the medical community has failed me
 
05:00:19.430 --> 05:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
repeatedly at every turn
 
05:00:21.470 --> 05:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
I wish just a child
 
05:00:23.510 --> 05:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't deserve any of this
 
05:00:24.948 --> 05:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
but I have to live with chronic physical
 
05:00:27.410 --> 05:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
and psychological pain because of this
 
05:00:29.570 --> 05:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
my voice will always be lower and weaker
 
05:00:31.670 --> 05:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
than it should be parts of my body have
 
05:00:34.070 --> 05:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
been masculized permanently and because
 
05:00:35.810 --> 05:00:35.820 align:start position:0%
my puberty was disrupted when I was
 
05:00:37.610 --> 05:00:37.620 align:start position:0%
barely a teenager
 
05:00:40.610 --> 05:00:40.620 align:start position:0%
I have stopped growing and I will never
 
05:00:43.910 --> 05:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
develop quite like I was supposed to
 
05:00:45.830 --> 05:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'm still suffering the consequences of
 
05:00:47.448 --> 05:00:47.458 align:start position:0%
the atrophy of my reproductive and
 
05:00:49.550 --> 05:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
pelvic organs I will never be able to
 
05:00:52.368 --> 05:00:52.378 align:start position:0%
breastfeed and I have no idea
 
05:00:54.110 --> 05:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
for how much longer these big wounds on
 
05:00:55.788 --> 05:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
my chest will be leaking fluid every day
 
05:00:58.010 --> 05:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
after every morning and after every
 
05:01:00.288 --> 05:01:00.298 align:start position:0%
shower I have to dress up these wounds
 
05:01:02.448 --> 05:01:02.458 align:start position:0%
with bandages so that this fluid doesn't
 
05:01:04.310 --> 05:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
stain my clothing and bedding
 
05:01:07.250 --> 05:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
no child and no adult deserves to go
 
05:01:09.288 --> 05:01:09.298 align:start position:0%
through the pain that I have if this is
 
05:01:10.788 --> 05:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
the outcome with fully supportive
 
05:01:13.610 --> 05:01:13.620 align:start position:0%
parents with the best resources possible
 
05:01:15.050 --> 05:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
do you really think it would be any
 
05:01:17.448 --> 05:01:17.458 align:start position:0%
better if we hide it from parents the
 
05:01:19.010 --> 05:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
best data we have on social transition
 
05:01:21.890 --> 05:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
to minors from the AAP says that once
 
05:01:23.868 --> 05:01:23.878 align:start position:0%
social transition is affirmed around 90
 
05:01:25.430 --> 05:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
or more will continue on to
 
05:01:25.440 --> 05:01:26.570 align:start position:0%
or more will continue on to
medicalization

05:01:26.570 --> 05:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
medicalization
 
05:01:29.150 --> 05:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
in another study if the child's identity
 
05:01:31.490 --> 05:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
is not affirmed the vast majority of
 
05:01:34.250 --> 05:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
kids will desist before the age of 18.
 
05:01:35.930 --> 05:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
they grow out of it when they're just
 
05:01:38.390 --> 05:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
given the chance to be kids
 
05:01:39.890 --> 05:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
how are teachers and school
 
05:01:42.170 --> 05:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
administrators qualified to administer
 
05:01:44.270 --> 05:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
complex psychological interventions like
 
05:01:46.430 --> 05:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
social transition knowing that by
 
05:01:48.170 --> 05:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
initiating this intervention it will
 
05:01:50.270 --> 05:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
lead to lifelong medical experimentation
 
05:01:52.910 --> 05:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
we have a chance today to turn the tide
 
05:01:55.490 --> 05:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it is of the essence
 
05:01:57.050 --> 05:01:57.060 align:start position:0%
that we fight this because there are
 
05:01:59.208 --> 05:01:59.218 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children many of whom are gay
 
05:02:01.910 --> 05:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
or on the Spectrum children just like me
 
05:02:04.610 --> 05:02:04.620 align:start position:0%
who are counting on us don't wait a
 
05:02:06.530 --> 05:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
decade until there are hundreds of me
 
05:02:09.050 --> 05:02:09.060 align:start position:0%
standing in front of you this is our
 
05:02:12.530 --> 05:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
last chance thank you thank you
 
05:02:17.330 --> 05:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:17.340 --> 05:02:23.690 align:start position:0%
 
b-r-e-n-n-a

05:02:23.690 --> 05:02:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:28.070 --> 05:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:31.128 --> 05:02:31.138 align:start position:0%
or we do need a little bit of that zener
 
05:02:32.810 --> 05:02:32.820 align:start position:0%
blows or you know the old cursive
 
05:02:35.448 --> 05:02:35.458 align:start position:0%
writing or manuscript the Palmer method
 
05:02:40.448 --> 05:02:40.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:46.250 --> 05:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:48.830 --> 05:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
05:02:53.810 --> 05:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:56.990 --> 05:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
because of so many of the things I've
 
05:02:57.000 --> 05:02:57.948 align:start position:0%
because of so many of the things I've
heard

05:02:57.948 --> 05:02:57.958 align:start position:0%
heard
 
05:03:00.410 --> 05:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
The Last Story
 
05:03:02.330 --> 05:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
was heartbreaking
 
05:03:06.708 --> 05:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
that was an individual with a story we
 
05:03:09.770 --> 05:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
need to remember that each of these kids
 
05:03:14.990 --> 05:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
are individuals with stories
 
05:03:18.410 --> 05:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
and with all due respect I do not
 
05:03:23.350 --> 05:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
believe that most kids choose to
 
05:03:26.690 --> 05:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
detransition when they grow up in fact
 
05:03:30.890 --> 05:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
what I have read is that very very few
 
05:03:32.390 --> 05:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
of them do
 
05:03:35.708 --> 05:03:35.718 align:start position:0%
and while my heart breaks for anybody
 
05:03:38.628 --> 05:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
that is hurting for what has happened to
 
05:03:41.628 --> 05:03:41.638 align:start position:0%
them my heart also breaks
 
05:03:45.170 --> 05:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
for the people that I have seen testify
 
05:03:49.670 --> 05:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
again and again and again please listen
 
05:03:53.390 --> 05:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
to us is what they say today I heard
 
05:03:56.750 --> 05:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
some particularly cruel things said and
 
05:03:59.448 --> 05:03:59.458 align:start position:0%
I watched a young person put their arm
 
05:04:03.890 --> 05:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
around another young person in the lgbtq
 
05:04:07.970 --> 05:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
community we are subjecting these kids
 
05:04:13.910 --> 05:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
to so much hurt and like it or not the
 
05:04:15.490 --> 05:04:15.500 align:start position:0%
truth is
 
05:04:19.730 --> 05:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
othering the transgender community and
 
05:04:23.330 --> 05:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
demonizing public teachers has spread
 
05:04:26.030 --> 05:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
across this country
 
05:04:28.970 --> 05:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
it's out there we see it we see it at
 
05:04:32.030 --> 05:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
political rallies we hear all kinds of
 
05:04:36.050 --> 05:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
terminology that is false meanwhile and
 
05:04:37.910 --> 05:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
I have done some research looked at
 
05:04:41.150 --> 05:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
statistics if you look at a school of a
 
05:04:44.510 --> 05:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
thousand kids there are probably five
 
05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
who are gender non-conforming who cannot
 
05:04:51.530 --> 05:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
go to a parent for whatever reason not
 
05:04:53.208 --> 05:04:53.218 align:start position:0%
because the parent's going to shoot them
 
05:04:55.368 --> 05:04:55.378 align:start position:0%
maybe the parent is going to say get out
 
05:04:57.708 --> 05:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
of the house maybe it's the shame maybe
 
05:05:00.830 --> 05:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
they just need time and yet we are
 
05:05:04.190 --> 05:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
putting all this effort
 
05:05:08.150 --> 05:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
into the four parts of this bill
 
05:05:12.110 --> 05:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
that might hurt those five kids out of a
 
05:05:14.810 --> 05:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
thousand why are we doing that why
 
05:05:17.628 --> 05:05:17.638 align:start position:0%
aren't we talking about what we should
 
05:05:21.050 --> 05:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
be talking about a good education for
 
05:05:24.708 --> 05:05:24.718 align:start position:0%
all kids finding ways to finance it that
 
05:05:27.590 --> 05:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
is fair finding the kind of Mental
 
05:05:30.350 --> 05:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
Health and Social Services that these
 
05:05:31.670 --> 05:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
kids need
 
05:05:34.368 --> 05:05:34.378 align:start position:0%
two of the speakers that I heard one
 
05:05:37.270 --> 05:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
listed all of the professional
 
05:05:40.010 --> 05:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
child-oriented organizations that are
 
05:05:43.010 --> 05:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
against this bill listen to them
 
05:05:47.150 --> 05:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
and please listen to the kids who have
 
05:05:50.288 --> 05:05:50.298 align:start position:0%
gone through it if they dare tell you
 
05:05:54.170 --> 05:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of them don't
 
05:06:00.470 --> 05:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:02.090 --> 05:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
we're in a hurry kids are getting off
 
05:06:06.890 --> 05:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:09.770 --> 05:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you taking my um I am in
 
05:06:13.610 --> 05:06:13.620 align:start position:0%
support of SB 272 my name is Therese
 
05:06:15.288 --> 05:06:15.298 align:start position:0%
brasterash I'm from Loudon New Hampshire
 
05:06:16.730 --> 05:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
I have two little boys who are going to
 
05:06:18.948 --> 05:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
get off the bus here shortly I want to
 
05:06:22.010 --> 05:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
First say that I do not see this bill as
 
05:06:24.490 --> 05:06:24.500 align:start position:0%
a transgender
 
05:06:27.948 --> 05:06:27.958 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation Bill whatsoever and I
 
05:06:30.050 --> 05:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
think that that has been the majority of
 
05:06:32.570 --> 05:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
the conversation here today
 
05:06:34.070 --> 05:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
um what has been brought to my attention
 
05:06:35.930 --> 05:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
is that there's surveys that are being
 
05:06:38.090 --> 05:06:38.100 align:start position:0%
given to our children in the schools in
 
05:06:40.190 --> 05:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
which the schools get compensation for
 
05:06:42.410 --> 05:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
that have a lot of information or
 
05:06:44.570 --> 05:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
questions in them that a lot of us
 
05:06:47.150 --> 05:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
parents would not want our child to be
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
asked the question as to is there
 
05:06:51.650 --> 05:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
someone of the same sex they would like
 
05:06:53.390 --> 05:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
to be intimate with without our
 
05:06:55.490 --> 05:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
knowledge we don't want to see things on
 
05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
our Chromebooks where it's asking a
 
05:07:00.110 --> 05:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
young man to ejaculate into a Mountain
 
05:07:02.090 --> 05:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
Dew bottle or be retaliated to drink
 
05:07:04.128 --> 05:07:04.138 align:start position:0%
someone else's ejaculate and not know
 
05:07:06.470 --> 05:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
that that's on their Chromebook we want
 
05:07:08.330 --> 05:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
to know what's in our libraries we want
 
05:07:09.830 --> 05:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
to know what our kids are being subject
 
05:07:11.868 --> 05:07:11.878 align:start position:0%
to we want to know what they're facing
 
05:07:14.330 --> 05:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
during their school day and that's being
 
05:07:16.850 --> 05:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
withheld from us
 
05:07:19.490 --> 05:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
quickly my testimony we're telling
 
05:07:21.770 --> 05:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
children to lie to parents
 
05:07:24.890 --> 05:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
is that not creating just more stigma
 
05:07:27.170 --> 05:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
like don't we want the community to
 
05:07:29.030 --> 05:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
embrace these children with wherever
 
05:07:31.128 --> 05:07:31.138 align:start position:0%
Pursuit of Happiness whatever their
 
05:07:32.868 --> 05:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
uniqueness is
 
05:07:35.570 --> 05:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
why would we want to foster a narrative
 
05:07:38.150 --> 05:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
and the rhetoric of you need to keep
 
05:07:40.430 --> 05:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
this quiet versus
 
05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
be proud you know tell the world who and
 
05:07:44.448 --> 05:07:44.458 align:start position:0%
how you feel
 
05:07:47.510 --> 05:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
and we are mandatory reporters I've
 
05:07:49.010 --> 05:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of training that needs to
 
05:07:50.570 --> 05:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
happen here because if a child is
 
05:07:53.990 --> 05:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
subject to incest or abuse or neglect
 
05:07:56.570 --> 05:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
that needs to be reported as a foster
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
mom every single time
 
05:08:00.240 --> 05:08:02.448 align:start position:0%
mom every single time
um

05:08:02.448 --> 05:08:02.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:04.970 --> 05:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
are we telling the children not to trust
 
05:08:06.590 --> 05:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
their parents and to keep lies from them
 
05:08:10.368 --> 05:08:10.378 align:start position:0%
but yet to trust a government employee
 
05:08:13.128 --> 05:08:13.138 align:start position:0%
zoom out on that one for a moment
 
05:08:17.090 --> 05:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
what happens when you're in China and at
 
05:08:19.490 --> 05:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
age five you go off to a boarding school
 
05:08:23.030 --> 05:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
and you as a parent have no say in what
 
05:08:24.770 --> 05:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
those are government employees want to
 
05:08:26.448 --> 05:08:26.458 align:start position:0%
feed to your child
 
05:08:28.550 --> 05:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
what if it is completely
 
05:08:30.590 --> 05:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
against their ability to pursue
 
05:08:33.230 --> 05:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
happiness in their own unique way

community and our culture to
 
05:08:40.788 --> 05:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
do we all not just want the ability to
 
05:08:43.070 --> 05:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
pursue happiness in our own unique ways
 
05:08:45.708 --> 05:08:45.718 align:start position:0%
if a child is fearful about coming out
 
05:08:48.350 --> 05:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
we are already mandatory reporters if
 
05:08:51.230 --> 05:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
that child is put in harm in doing so
 
05:08:53.150 --> 05:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
do we not want to make certain that this
 
05:08:55.190 --> 05:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
population this is a big one for me I'm
 
05:08:56.208 --> 05:08:56.218 align:start position:0%
a nurse
 
05:09:00.050 --> 05:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
I know my license I know the boundaries
 
05:09:03.110 --> 05:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
of where I'm supposed to practice if I
 
05:09:05.628 --> 05:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
go beyond that I can harm someone if
 
05:09:08.270 --> 05:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
this demographic is truly 40 chance of
 
05:09:11.628 --> 05:09:11.638 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideation time is up I would
 
05:09:13.128 --> 05:09:13.138 align:start position:0%
just say we need to make sure those
 
05:09:15.410 --> 05:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
children get to True professionals to
 
05:09:17.090 --> 05:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
help save their lives
 
05:09:19.010 --> 05:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
they are wonderfully and beautifully
 
05:09:21.288 --> 05:09:21.298 align:start position:0%
made and I would hug every single person
 
05:09:23.810 --> 05:09:23.820 align:start position:0%
in this room there is not time for hate
 
05:09:25.910 --> 05:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
but these children deserve to have
 
05:09:29.390 --> 05:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:33.170 --> 05:09:33.180 align:start position:0%

Dartmouth College in Hanover and I would

like to testify in opposition of SB 272
 
05:10:04.250 --> 05:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
I want to start by saying that I won't
 
05:10:06.288 --> 05:10:06.298 align:start position:0%
pretend I know what it's like being a
 
05:10:08.090 --> 05:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
queer identifying public school student
 
05:10:10.788 --> 05:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I want to clarify
 
05:10:13.128 --> 05:10:13.138 align:start position:0%
that Chloe Cole the D transitioner who
 
05:10:14.990 --> 05:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
spoke earlier and also spoke at my
 
05:10:17.030 --> 05:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
school yesterday is not a New Hampshire
 
05:10:20.810 --> 05:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
resident so I will proudly admit that I
 
05:10:23.030 --> 05:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
did not grow up here I grew up going to
 
05:10:24.590 --> 05:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
private school in the Bay Area
 
05:10:27.110 --> 05:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
California pretty much as sheltered as
 
05:10:29.390 --> 05:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
you can get I was lucky enough to
 
05:10:31.128 --> 05:10:31.138 align:start position:0%
inhabit spaces at school where my
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
queerness would have been accepted
 
05:10:35.030 --> 05:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
without much question if I so chose to
 
05:10:36.110 --> 05:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
claim it
 
05:10:38.810 --> 05:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
but I didn't I only came out as
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
non-binary and started socially
 
05:10:43.250 --> 05:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
transitioning a couple months ago I only
 
05:10:45.170 --> 05:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
allowed myself to explore my identity
 
05:10:47.628 --> 05:10:47.638 align:start position:0%
after settling down in college on the
 
05:10:49.670 --> 05:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
opposite side of the country where I
 
05:10:51.350 --> 05:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
knew I could have a fresh start away
 
05:10:53.330 --> 05:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
from everyone who knew or thought they
 
05:10:55.970 --> 05:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
knew me I still somehow managed to
 
05:10:58.550 --> 05:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
internalize a harmful rhetoric that I
 
05:11:00.350 --> 05:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't possibly know what I wanted for
 
05:11:02.930 --> 05:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
myself and that therefore it would be a
 
05:11:04.910 --> 05:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
waste of time to treat my queerness as
 
05:11:07.850 --> 05:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
anything but a phase and now it's all
 
05:11:09.530 --> 05:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
catching up to me while I've got a
 
05:11:12.230 --> 05:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
degree to pursue and a future to plan it
 
05:11:14.208 --> 05:11:14.218 align:start position:0%
feels like there is never a right time
 
05:11:17.270 --> 05:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
to sit down breathe and figure out who I
 
05:11:17.280 --> 05:11:18.170 align:start position:0%
to sit down breathe and figure out who I
am

05:11:18.170 --> 05:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
am
 
05:11:21.110 --> 05:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
passing a bill like SB 272 would only
 
05:11:23.628 --> 05:11:23.638 align:start position:0%
cut down on this precious time it would
 
05:11:26.030 --> 05:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
deny young people the safe space to come
 
05:11:28.010 --> 05:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
into their own identity without fear of
 
05:11:30.288 --> 05:11:30.298 align:start position:0%
judgment that is before they enter into
 
05:11:32.990 --> 05:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
the real world and face ever more casual
 
05:11:35.570 --> 05:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
and blatant bigotry it would enlist
 
05:11:37.310 --> 05:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
teachers and other peers to police
 
05:11:39.410 --> 05:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
gender Norms within the highly vague
 
05:11:42.830 --> 05:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
parameters of any I quote circumstances
 
05:11:44.750 --> 05:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
which a reasonable person would
 
05:11:46.430 --> 05:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
understand to be for the purpose of
 
05:11:49.368 --> 05:11:49.378 align:start position:0%
facilitating a change and gender
 
05:11:52.670 --> 05:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
I ask who gets to decide what counts as
 
05:11:54.830 --> 05:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
socially acceptable femininity and
 
05:11:57.530 --> 05:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
socially acceptable masculinity why are
 
05:11:59.690 --> 05:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
we reinforcing these dated oppressive
 
05:12:02.330 --> 05:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
binary stereotypes in the first place
 
05:12:04.730 --> 05:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
lastly the bill would directly endanger
 
05:12:06.850 --> 05:12:06.860 align:start position:0%
the young people most at risk for harm
 
05:12:10.010 --> 05:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
the parents most likely to invoke the
 
05:12:12.650 --> 05:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
right to know about their child binding
 
05:12:14.990 --> 05:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
their chest at school are probably the
 
05:12:16.990 --> 05:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
ones most likely to punish them for it
 
05:12:19.310 --> 05:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
furthermore we're crucially for getting
 
05:12:21.770 --> 05:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
here that school is not an equally safe
 
05:12:24.770 --> 05:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
space for all speaking as one of the few
 
05:12:27.410 --> 05:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
and maybe the only young queer person of
 
05:12:30.590 --> 05:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
color here in this room I don't need yet
 
05:12:32.810 --> 05:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
another reason for people to surveil me
 
05:12:36.350 --> 05:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
single me out and instill shame in me on
 
05:12:39.230 --> 05:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
the basis of my minority identity so
 
05:12:40.610 --> 05:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
while the policy may have been
 
05:12:42.288 --> 05:12:42.298 align:start position:0%
formulated in the name of protecting
 
05:12:44.030 --> 05:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
children it is clear that it only
 
05:12:47.270 --> 05:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
further jeopardizes Us by threatening
 
05:12:50.570 --> 05:12:50.580 align:start position:0%
our basic rights to autonomy and privacy
 
05:12:52.970 --> 05:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
it takes a lot of Courage especially as
 
05:12:54.890 --> 05:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
a young person to stand in defiance of
 
05:12:58.730 --> 05:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
compulsory norms and live as a true self
 
05:13:01.010 --> 05:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
I'm I just urge you all to vote in
 
05:13:04.128 --> 05:13:04.138 align:start position:0%
opposition of sb2 thank you
 
05:13:08.810 --> 05:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:11.930 --> 05:13:11.940 align:start position:0%

05:13:29.570 --> 05:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
do you hear me okay go ahead Julie Smith
 
05:13:32.890 --> 05:13:32.900 align:start position:0%
from Nashua I support this bill
 
05:13:36.110 --> 05:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
transparent is a compound word the first
 
05:13:39.170 --> 05:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
part trans which is Latin for a cross
 
05:13:42.050 --> 05:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
is what the opposition wants the
 
05:13:44.330 --> 05:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
committee to concentrate on the second
 
05:13:47.090 --> 05:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
is parent as in the theme of this bill
 
05:13:49.368 --> 05:13:49.378 align:start position:0%
it is no accident that this bill is
 
05:13:51.890 --> 05:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
about transparency I'm asking the
 
05:13:54.288 --> 05:13:54.298 align:start position:0%
committee to ignore all the out-of-state
 
05:13:56.270 --> 05:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
and paid agitators gathered in the
 
05:13:58.788 --> 05:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
capital today trying to Brand this bill
 
05:14:02.628 --> 05:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
as lgbtq ABCDEFG
 
05:14:05.208 --> 05:14:05.218 align:start position:0%
instead please indulge my request that
 
05:14:07.368 --> 05:14:07.378 align:start position:0%
you swap out that theme for something
 
05:14:10.128 --> 05:14:10.138 align:start position:0%
else any other issue that we can all
 
05:14:11.868 --> 05:14:11.878 align:start position:0%
agree on that requires parental
 
05:14:14.270 --> 05:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
notification as per the moral compass
 
05:14:16.610 --> 05:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
though not a comprehensive list some
 
05:14:19.368 --> 05:14:19.378 align:start position:0%
suggestions are new and unusual behavior
 
05:14:21.770 --> 05:14:21.780 align:start position:0%
declining academic performance or
 
05:14:23.868 --> 05:14:23.878 align:start position:0%
symptoms of a medical problem
 
05:14:26.628 --> 05:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
and I urge you at this committee to
 
05:14:29.150 --> 05:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
visit prageru.com and watch their
 
05:14:31.610 --> 05:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
five-minute video preferably at the
 
05:14:33.708 --> 05:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
beginning of an executive session to
 
05:14:35.150 --> 05:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
vote on this bill
 
05:14:38.390 --> 05:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
about the Dark Art of framing because
 
05:14:40.430 --> 05:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
that's what's going on
 
05:14:42.708 --> 05:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
as it has been for hours here in this
 
05:14:42.718 --> 05:14:43.788 align:start position:0%
as it has been for hours here in this
room

05:14:43.788 --> 05:14:43.798 align:start position:0%
room
 
05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
and all of New Hampshire and in the 49
 
05:14:48.110 --> 05:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
other states
 
05:14:51.170 --> 05:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
once alert to that strategy
 
05:14:53.090 --> 05:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
the committee can recognize it being
 
05:14:55.490 --> 05:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
applied to other bills as well so it is
 
05:14:57.170 --> 05:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
a good investment of time
 
05:14:59.510 --> 05:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
as someone without kids who's forced to
 
05:15:01.670 --> 05:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
pay for the education of other people's
 
05:15:04.128 --> 05:15:04.138 align:start position:0%
kids I support this bill because I
 
05:15:05.690 --> 05:15:05.700 align:start position:0%
object to the culture war against
 
05:15:09.230 --> 05:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
parents admittedly 40 years ago I would
 
05:15:11.448 --> 05:15:11.458 align:start position:0%
not have felt the same way but it was my
 
05:15:14.208 --> 05:15:14.218 align:start position:0%
own parents who lectured me about the
 
05:15:16.610 --> 05:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
assault on the family unit being a big
 
05:15:18.890 --> 05:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
part of the Marxist Playbook
 
05:15:21.110 --> 05:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
everyone is the secrets their secrets
 
05:15:23.208 --> 05:15:23.218 align:start position:0%
and sick people rarely get well if they
 
05:15:25.010 --> 05:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
don't know they're sick and their
 
05:15:27.708 --> 05:15:27.718 align:start position:0%
sickness is kept secret from those best
 
05:15:30.470 --> 05:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
in position to help them their parents
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
one year ago
 
05:15:34.730 --> 05:15:34.740 align:start position:0%

05:15:46.190 --> 05:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
that was the Senate hearing for HB 1131
 
05:15:48.530 --> 05:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
that bill was essentially also about
 
05:15:51.530 --> 05:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
parental rights while it was in this
 
05:15:53.810 --> 05:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
very committee during a blizzard on
 
05:15:56.990 --> 05:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
February 25th of last year we heard
 
05:15:59.990 --> 05:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
about a student suicide attempt that
 
05:16:01.730 --> 05:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
student's parent
 
05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
who was previously a school candidate
 
05:16:06.830 --> 05:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
made a point to make the journey here in
 
05:16:08.448 --> 05:16:08.458 align:start position:0%
a blizzard
 
05:16:11.930 --> 05:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
to be heard as did many others don't you
 
05:16:13.788 --> 05:16:13.798 align:start position:0%
think that's evidence enough that nearly
 
05:16:16.310 --> 05:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
every parent loves their kids as Senator
 
05:16:18.470 --> 05:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
Carson had pointed out earlier
 
05:16:20.208 --> 05:16:20.218 align:start position:0%
kids were not property of the government
 
05:16:23.270 --> 05:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
and schools need to stay in their Lane
 
05:16:25.310 --> 05:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
I have no representation in the house
 
05:16:27.050 --> 05:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
therefore I am counting on this
 
05:16:29.330 --> 05:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
committee to support this bill Second
 
05:16:32.448 --> 05:16:32.458 align:start position:0%
Chance time is up please vote yes thank
 
05:16:32.458 --> 05:16:35.810 align:start position:0%
Chance time is up please vote yes thank
you

05:16:35.810 --> 05:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:46.570 --> 05:16:46.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:50.330 --> 05:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:55.868 --> 05:16:55.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:00.650 --> 05:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:03.110 --> 05:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
hi everyone I did submit written
 
05:17:04.670 --> 05:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
testimony and I had a whole speech
 
05:17:05.868 --> 05:17:05.878 align:start position:0%
prepared but I've been sitting here
 
05:17:08.750 --> 05:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
today taking this all in and um I'm
 
05:17:09.890 --> 05:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
gonna wing it
 
05:17:12.350 --> 05:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
my name is Lisa Rappaport I am a member
 
05:17:14.208 --> 05:17:14.218 align:start position:0%
of the school board in Portsmouth New
 
05:17:16.550 --> 05:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would like to just kindly
 
05:17:18.410 --> 05:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
remind everyone in this room no matter
 
05:17:19.970 --> 05:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
what you believe you actually do have
 
05:17:22.250 --> 05:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
right you have a right to vote you have
 
05:17:23.930 --> 05:17:23.940 align:start position:0%
a right to vote for school boards who in
 
05:17:26.208 --> 05:17:26.218 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have one job which is to
 
05:17:29.930 --> 05:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
set policy for local schools we have had
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
a policy in Portsmouth for many years
 
05:17:35.810 --> 05:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
now that offers broad protection from
 
05:17:38.090 --> 05:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
discrimination and surveillance for
 
05:17:39.590 --> 05:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
every single one of our students
 
05:17:43.010 --> 05:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
including our lgbtq students this law
 
05:17:45.830 --> 05:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
would decimate Portsmouth policy and
 
05:17:48.288 --> 05:17:48.298 align:start position:0%
policy in many other schools across the
 
05:17:50.810 --> 05:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
state policy that was set by locally
 
05:17:53.150 --> 05:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
elected school boards who were chosen by
 
05:17:54.770 --> 05:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
the people who live in those communities
 
05:17:57.410 --> 05:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
who send their children to those schools
 
05:17:59.628 --> 05:17:59.638 align:start position:0%
and I fully respect the right of anyone
 
05:18:01.910 --> 05:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
here who doesn't want to send their
 
05:18:03.650 --> 05:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
child to public school or who doesn't
 
05:18:06.350 --> 05:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
like the values that I have to
 
05:18:09.288 --> 05:18:09.298 align:start position:0%
vote me out that's your right I hope you
 
05:18:11.810 --> 05:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
don't but you can and you do have a
 
05:18:13.788 --> 05:18:13.798 align:start position:0%
voice I have been an active PTA
 
05:18:16.070 --> 05:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
volunteer the entire time my kids have
 
05:18:17.690 --> 05:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
been in school I have shop around field
 
05:18:20.448 --> 05:18:20.458 align:start position:0%
trips I have volunteered in classrooms I
 
05:18:22.190 --> 05:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
have been on a first name basis with
 
05:18:24.410 --> 05:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
every single teacher my children have
 
05:18:25.970 --> 05:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
had the entire time they've been in
 
05:18:29.150 --> 05:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
public schools and I just have to say it
 
05:18:31.190 --> 05:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
has been so emotionally challenging to
 
05:18:33.530 --> 05:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
sit here all day and listen to people
 
05:18:36.830 --> 05:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
evoke totalitarian regimes to talk about
 
05:18:40.010 --> 05:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
our teachers and our Educators who are
 
05:18:42.230 --> 05:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
working their asses off in a really hard
 
05:18:44.810 --> 05:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
circumstance every day for not great pay
 
05:18:47.030 --> 05:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
and they deal with a lot of grief
 
05:18:49.610 --> 05:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
my dad was a public school teacher my
 
05:18:51.890 --> 05:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
dad is a holocaust Survivor I'm wearing
 
05:18:53.868 --> 05:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
today on my left hand my grandmother's
 
05:18:56.330 --> 05:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
wedding ring and she survived Nazi
 
05:18:57.948 --> 05:18:57.958 align:start position:0%
Germany so I think you have to ask
 
05:18:59.570 --> 05:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
yourself which side of History you want
 
05:19:01.670 --> 05:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
to be on here do you want to be on the
 
05:19:04.250 --> 05:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
side of the proud boys and the neo-nazis
 
05:19:06.410 --> 05:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
or do you want to be on the side of
 
05:19:08.448 --> 05:19:08.458 align:start position:0%
people in the state of New Hampshire who
 
05:19:10.788 --> 05:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
respect personal Liberty I'm not saying
 
05:19:12.288 --> 05:19:12.298 align:start position:0%
that I should have a right to choose the
 
05:19:15.050 --> 05:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
values for anybody else's family I am
 
05:19:16.850 --> 05:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
asking you to respect the fact that our
 
05:19:18.830 --> 05:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
public schools are supposed to serve
 
05:19:22.010 --> 05:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
every single family including families
 
05:19:24.230 --> 05:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
of Faith including families who do not
 
05:19:26.330 --> 05:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
want to have their kids be gay I mean I
 
05:19:28.128 --> 05:19:28.138 align:start position:0%
hope that parents can support their kids
 
05:19:31.010 --> 05:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
but we need to include all people in our
 
05:19:33.288 --> 05:19:33.298 align:start position:0%
public schools and this bill doesn't do
 
05:19:36.288 --> 05:19:36.298 align:start position:0%
that this bill says that my children who
 
05:19:38.810 --> 05:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
are non-binary both of them and who both
 
05:19:41.510 --> 05:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
came out to me in their own time and in
 
05:19:43.368 --> 05:19:43.378 align:start position:0%
their own way and who would have been
 
05:19:44.510 --> 05:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
here today but they didn't want to miss
 
05:19:44.520 --> 05:19:45.550 align:start position:0%
here today but they didn't want to miss
school

05:19:45.550 --> 05:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:19:47.930 --> 05:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
it says that it's not okay for them to
 
05:19:49.910 --> 05:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
be who they are it says it's not okay
 
05:19:52.250 --> 05:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
for them to go to the GSA and talk to
 
05:19:54.050 --> 05:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
their friends and talk to their teachers
 
05:19:56.810 --> 05:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
and just share experiences and work
 
05:19:58.850 --> 05:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
things out and I would respectfully say
 
05:20:01.010 --> 05:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
if all of you don't think this is really
 
05:20:03.050 --> 05:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
about discriminating against trans kids
 
05:20:05.090 --> 05:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
then you know what you got about 40
 
05:20:07.070 --> 05:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
lines of text you can remove from this
 
05:20:08.930 --> 05:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
bill right now that will no longer
 
05:20:12.110 --> 05:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
Target trans kids and lgbtq kids so if
 
05:20:13.730 --> 05:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
this is just about parents being able to
 
05:20:16.070 --> 05:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
join a PTA or go to the school board
 
05:20:21.830 --> 05:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:25.010 --> 05:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
Carla Garcia
 
05:20:32.990 --> 05:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:58.910 --> 05:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:01.910 --> 05:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
let me start off with saying I was a
 
05:21:04.250 --> 05:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
transgender woman for over 20 years
 
05:21:06.590 --> 05:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
I'm a d transitioner
 
05:21:12.590 --> 05:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
I am a gay man not queer queer's a slur
 
05:21:14.628 --> 05:21:14.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to address the elephant in
 
05:21:16.190 --> 05:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
the room
 
05:21:19.010 --> 05:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
I was a member and an advocate
 
05:21:24.708 --> 05:21:24.718 align:start position:0%
of the lgbtqia trans queer gender cult
 
05:21:27.890 --> 05:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
for over 30 years
 
05:21:30.830 --> 05:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
this coat destroyed me mentally and
 
05:21:33.410 --> 05:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
physically and emotionally
 
05:21:35.810 --> 05:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
so I can call it a cult
 
05:21:38.570 --> 05:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
I was the suicidal trans kid that we've
 
05:21:40.070 --> 05:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
heard about all day
 
05:21:42.170 --> 05:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
I was also a suicidal trans adult
 
05:21:44.930 --> 05:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
because transition affirmation and
 
05:21:47.930 --> 05:21:47.940 align:start position:0%
acceptance does not take away depression
 
05:21:51.410 --> 05:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
angst and suicidal ideation
 
05:21:54.288 --> 05:21:54.298 align:start position:0%
as a child I was targeted
 
05:21:56.810 --> 05:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
I was desensitized I was groomed
 
05:22:00.830 --> 05:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
molested abused conditioned sex
 
05:22:04.250 --> 05:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
trafficked by this cult
 
05:22:07.610 --> 05:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
my proof is my past thank you for
 
05:22:09.890 --> 05:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
talking about me earlier I am a
 
05:22:13.190 --> 05:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
registered sex offender because directly
 
05:22:15.288 --> 05:22:15.298 align:start position:0%
because of what this cult
 
05:22:18.170 --> 05:22:18.180 align:start position:0%
has done to me for over 30 years
 
05:22:21.590 --> 05:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
I became an agent for this movement and
 
05:22:24.288 --> 05:22:24.298 align:start position:0%
for my sex traffickers
 
05:22:27.410 --> 05:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
at age six molested for the first of
 
05:22:28.850 --> 05:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
hundreds of times
 
05:22:32.208 --> 05:22:32.218 align:start position:0%
age 13 and mind you this is all by my
 
05:22:34.070 --> 05:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
own community
 
05:22:38.270 --> 05:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
age 13 I over overdosed on pills age 14
 
05:22:40.910 --> 05:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
I was The Runaway prostitute sex
 
05:22:43.788 --> 05:22:43.798 align:start position:0%
trafficked suicidal trans kid we all
 
05:22:46.850 --> 05:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
hear about I began wrong sex hormones at
 
05:22:50.930 --> 05:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
age 14. also was on drugs alcohol I was
 
05:22:55.970 --> 05:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
also had HIV AIDS at age 14. age 15 my
 
05:22:58.128 --> 05:22:58.138 align:start position:0%
mental deterioration started from
 
05:23:01.190 --> 05:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
directly from the hormones
 
05:23:04.368 --> 05:23:04.378 align:start position:0%
age 16 I attempted suicide again
 
05:23:07.690 --> 05:23:07.700 align:start position:0%
I was also sterile and had and have
 
05:23:12.070 --> 05:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
severe Progressive osteoporosis
 
05:23:14.750 --> 05:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
strictly from the wrong sex hormones
 
05:23:16.850 --> 05:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
everyone that knew me thought I was
 
05:23:20.030 --> 05:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
content happy and secure in my identity
 
05:23:22.010 --> 05:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
as my true self
 
05:23:24.948 --> 05:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
none of them knew that I was miserable I
 
05:23:28.910 --> 05:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
was broken and I was suicidal
 
05:23:31.190 --> 05:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
hurting and depressed
 
05:23:35.868 --> 05:23:35.878 align:start position:0%
had I not been groomed by this cult
 
05:23:37.730 --> 05:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't have destroyed my life and I
 
05:23:39.970 --> 05:23:39.980 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't be here today

young man named Enrique and Jonathan
 
05:24:41.208 --> 05:24:41.218 align:start position:0%
Enrique figured out that at the age of
 
05:24:43.310 --> 05:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
12 he was gay
 
05:24:46.850 --> 05:24:46.860 align:start position:0%

05:24:49.670 --> 05:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:53.090 --> 05:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
at the age of 14 Jonathan was forced out

Enrique is forced to live with that
 
05:25:11.990 --> 05:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
image for the rest of his life
 
05:25:15.110 --> 05:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
at the age of 15 Enrique comes out to
 
05:25:18.410 --> 05:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
his algebra teacher which ironically
 
05:25:21.230 --> 05:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
he was failing that class but he trusted
 
05:25:23.330 --> 05:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
and loved that teacher that teacher
 
05:25:25.910 --> 05:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
guided Enrique to become the man that he
 
05:25:27.770 --> 05:25:27.780 align:start position:0%
is today
 
05:25:29.750 --> 05:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
I am Enrique
 
05:25:32.690 --> 05:25:32.700 align:start position:0%

05:25:36.170 --> 05:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
parents that did not accept me
 
05:25:37.910 --> 05:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
when I came out to my parents I was
 
05:25:39.830 --> 05:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
kicked out of my house in Haverhill
 
05:25:41.930 --> 05:25:41.940 align:start position:0%

somebody did not love me or accept me
 
05:25:58.550 --> 05:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
I am grateful today that my parents have
 
05:26:00.350 --> 05:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
come a long way and because of time and
 
05:26:02.810 --> 05:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
age and the information out there my
 
05:26:04.610 --> 05:26:04.620 align:start position:0%

05:26:10.190 --> 05:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
but this is the real story happening out
 
05:26:12.590 --> 05:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
there this is what we're forcing trans
 
05:26:16.190 --> 05:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
kids to face every single day so you
 
05:26:19.610 --> 05:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
have a choice you can be the hero in my
 
05:26:21.110 --> 05:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
life story
 
05:26:22.788 --> 05:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
or you could be the monster that
 
05:26:25.310 --> 05:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
continues to perpetuate this Injustice
 
05:26:27.890 --> 05:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
and this unfairness that lgbtq students
 
05:26:32.030 --> 05:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
are having to face every single day
 
05:26:34.610 --> 05:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
so for the rest of my life
 
05:26:37.190 --> 05:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
I will have to remember Jonathan and
 
05:26:39.890 --> 05:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
keep his life and his memory alive
 
05:26:41.570 --> 05:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
I hope you all understand how painful
 
05:26:43.788 --> 05:26:43.798 align:start position:0%
this was to share with you
 
05:26:45.470 --> 05:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
but I hope you take it more seriously
 
05:26:47.090 --> 05:26:47.100 align:start position:0%

05:27:54.890 --> 05:27:54.900 align:start position:0%

05:28:04.850 --> 05:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
I hear a lot of words and
 
05:28:04.860 --> 05:28:08.390 align:start position:0%
I hear a lot of words and
um

05:28:08.390 --> 05:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:11.690 --> 05:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
that describe feelings and
 
05:28:15.890 --> 05:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
I don't come or approach this place
 
05:28:18.890 --> 05:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
with a heart of judgment
 
05:28:21.830 --> 05:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
but I do approach this place
 
05:28:25.970 --> 05:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
with ears to hear and have a heart of
 
05:28:25.980 --> 05:28:27.948 align:start position:0%
with ears to hear and have a heart of
discernment

05:28:27.948 --> 05:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
discernment
 
05:28:30.650 --> 05:28:30.660 align:start position:0%
and because my father modeled for me
 
05:28:33.288 --> 05:28:33.298 align:start position:0%
what a parent and how a parent should
 
05:28:33.298 --> 05:28:34.190 align:start position:0%
what a parent and how a parent should
walk

05:28:34.190 --> 05:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
walk
 
05:28:37.250 --> 05:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
I too walk that for my kids
 
05:28:41.270 --> 05:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
my eldest will soon be 23. to this day
 
05:28:44.150 --> 05:28:44.160 align:start position:0%

05:28:46.250 --> 05:28:46.260 align:start position:0%

05:28:59.090 --> 05:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
I'm not perfect
 
05:29:02.868 --> 05:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
but I do stand on behalf of my god-given
 
05:29:05.330 --> 05:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
right as a parent
 
05:29:08.030 --> 05:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
because I've been giving children and
 
05:29:10.190 --> 05:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
that's a blessing and I take it with the
 
05:29:11.990 --> 05:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
utmost respect
 
05:29:15.230 --> 05:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
and fervent reverence
 
05:29:18.410 --> 05:29:18.420 align:start position:0%
and I trust that this committee
 
05:29:22.010 --> 05:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
would please support this bill it
 
05:29:24.530 --> 05:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
matters to me and it matters to the
 
05:29:26.570 --> 05:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
other parents who have had this similar
 
05:29:26.580 --> 05:29:27.890 align:start position:0%
other parents who have had this similar
experience

05:29:27.890 --> 05:29:27.900 align:start position:0%
experience
 
05:29:31.070 --> 05:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
and to those who have suffered I get it
 
05:29:34.070 --> 05:29:34.080 align:start position:0%

that are in outside of the city Gates
 
05:29:48.230 --> 05:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
our hearts are for them
 
05:29:50.990 --> 05:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
so that they can be restored
 
05:29:53.810 --> 05:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
let's keep that in the back of my of our
 
05:29:57.350 --> 05:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
minds when we enter in the school system
 
05:29:59.390 --> 05:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
it's a heart of restoration and respect
 
05:30:01.970 --> 05:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
and honor first to the parents
 
05:30:04.430 --> 05:30:04.440 align:start position:0%

good afternoon and thank you for your
 
05:30:40.128 --> 05:30:40.138 align:start position:0%
taking the time to listen to me
 
05:30:42.350 --> 05:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
my name is Jama Wilder I am the mother
 
05:30:45.530 --> 05:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
of five children and last year I removed
 
05:30:47.448 --> 05:30:47.458 align:start position:0%
my two oldest children from the Hollis
 
05:30:49.430 --> 05:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
Brookline School District
 
05:30:52.010 --> 05:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
I attempted to voice my concerns at the
 
05:30:53.868 --> 05:30:53.878 align:start position:0%
town meeting in March about the
 
05:30:56.030 --> 05:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum and the programs they have
 
05:30:57.530 --> 05:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
been implementing
 
05:30:59.868 --> 05:30:59.878 align:start position:0%
we were voting on the school budget and
 
05:31:01.910 --> 05:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
it was very relevant for people to make
 
05:31:03.830 --> 05:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
an informed decision
 
05:31:06.708 --> 05:31:06.718 align:start position:0%
the moderator shut off my microphone
 
05:31:09.410 --> 05:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
because extremists at the meeting were
 
05:31:11.390 --> 05:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
yelling that I wasn't speaking to the
 
05:31:14.990 --> 05:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
article which was an outright lie
 
05:31:17.570 --> 05:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
I wasn't out of time but I was silenced
 
05:31:19.970 --> 05:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
because I contradicted The Narrative of
 
05:31:21.470 --> 05:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
the radicals
 
05:31:24.288 --> 05:31:24.298 align:start position:0%
parents and families are the foundation
 
05:31:27.948 --> 05:31:27.958 align:start position:0%
of this society and this bill protects
 
05:31:30.708 --> 05:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
god-given rights that should not have to
 
05:31:32.090 --> 05:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
be defined
 
05:31:35.030 --> 05:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
I was completely shut out of my child's
 
05:31:38.810 --> 05:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
education I was refused curriculum
 
05:31:40.788 --> 05:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
I was told I could not meet with
 
05:31:42.530 --> 05:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
teachers without an administrator
 
05:31:42.540 --> 05:31:44.030 align:start position:0%
teachers without an administrator
present

05:31:44.030 --> 05:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
present
 
05:31:47.150 --> 05:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
denied access to my children's classroom
 
05:31:49.190 --> 05:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
and the library
 
05:31:52.010 --> 05:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
I blame the administrators not the
 
05:31:53.570 --> 05:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
teachers for this
 
05:31:55.910 --> 05:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
parents that love their children and
 
05:31:58.850 --> 05:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
have concerns are being actively pushed
 
05:32:01.670 --> 05:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
out of having a say in what is happening
 
05:32:04.368 --> 05:32:04.378 align:start position:0%
in their children's education
 
05:32:07.310 --> 05:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
in many cases parents don't even see
 
05:32:09.948 --> 05:32:09.958 align:start position:0%
books or assignments because of the way
 
05:32:12.230 --> 05:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
technology is used today
 
05:32:15.708 --> 05:32:15.718 align:start position:0%
if a child is sent to school the parent
 
05:32:18.590 --> 05:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
is entrusting the teachers to educate
 
05:32:22.010 --> 05:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
their children not to indoctrinate them
 
05:32:25.250 --> 05:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
I am shocked that so many people would
 
05:32:27.830 --> 05:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
be in opposition of this bill
 
05:32:30.530 --> 05:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
children are impressed impressionable
 
05:32:33.650 --> 05:32:33.660 align:start position:0%
and can be easily swayed into believing
 
05:32:37.128 --> 05:32:37.138 align:start position:0%
things that are not true it is our job
 
05:32:40.190 --> 05:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
as loving parents to guide them and
 
05:32:42.650 --> 05:32:42.660 align:start position:0%
raise them in the way they should go
 
05:32:45.230 --> 05:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
I personally think it's disturbing to be
 
05:32:47.628 --> 05:32:47.638 align:start position:0%
having conversations with children as
 
05:32:51.590 --> 05:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
young as six years old about gender they
 
05:32:53.868 --> 05:32:53.878 align:start position:0%
are planting seeds and causing children
 
05:32:56.510 --> 05:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
to question things they should not even
 
05:32:58.550 --> 05:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
be considering
 
05:33:02.150 --> 05:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
it is every parent's right to know if
 
05:33:04.850 --> 05:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
statements are made by their child at
 
05:33:07.070 --> 05:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
school or anywhere that they would
 
05:33:09.890 --> 05:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
question anything regarding concerns or
 
05:33:13.550 --> 05:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
Life Changes they want to make if this
 
05:33:16.730 --> 05:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
bill is not passed I will begin a
 
05:33:21.830 --> 05:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
campaign to pull children out of schools
 
05:33:25.190 --> 05:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
and have parents start homeschooling
 
05:33:27.230 --> 05:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of us out here that are
 
05:33:29.390 --> 05:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
already doing it and there's going to be
 
05:33:31.368 --> 05:33:31.378 align:start position:0%
a lot more if you don't give parents
 
05:33:34.430 --> 05:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
rights thank you
 
05:33:37.610 --> 05:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'd like to invite
 
05:33:46.010 --> 05:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:48.650 --> 05:33:48.660 align:start position:0%
hi that's me Holloway testerman I'm here
 
05:33:51.890 --> 05:33:51.900 align:start position:0%
to speak in opposition to the bill and I
 
05:33:53.570 --> 05:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
just want to say I really hear the last
 
05:33:55.490 --> 05:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
couple people that have spoken because I
 
05:33:57.590 --> 05:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
was actually raised in a very
 
05:34:00.410 --> 05:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
conservative religious community I was
 
05:34:03.948 --> 05:34:03.958 align:start position:0%
homeschooled K-12 I went to a private
 
05:34:06.650 --> 05:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
Christian College so really you know for
 
05:34:09.050 --> 05:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
people who support this bill my parents
 
05:34:10.550 --> 05:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
were involved in every facet of my
 
05:34:10.560 --> 05:34:12.050 align:start position:0%
were involved in every facet of my
education

05:34:12.050 --> 05:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:34:13.850 --> 05:34:13.860 align:start position:0%
um I I mean I will say I do love and
 
05:34:16.490 --> 05:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
respect them deeply and you know they
 
05:34:18.110 --> 05:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
also impose their religious and moral
 
05:34:18.120 --> 05:34:19.090 align:start position:0%
also impose their religious and moral
values

05:34:19.090 --> 05:34:19.100 align:start position:0%
values
 
05:34:21.470 --> 05:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
including the idea that queerness is a
 
05:34:23.930 --> 05:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
sin over my entire academic and social
 
05:34:27.288 --> 05:34:27.298 align:start position:0%
life and yet I'm still bisexual and this
 
05:34:28.430 --> 05:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
is actually the first time that I've
 
05:34:30.110 --> 05:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
come out in public
 
05:34:32.868 --> 05:34:32.878 align:start position:0%
um parental involvement did nothing to
 
05:34:35.628 --> 05:34:35.638 align:start position:0%
make my queerness go away it only served
 
05:34:38.208 --> 05:34:38.218 align:start position:0%
to make me repress my identity and it
 
05:34:41.208 --> 05:34:41.218 align:start position:0%
created complex PTSD from being in a
 
05:34:43.190 --> 05:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
consistently homophobic environment that
 
05:34:46.010 --> 05:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
I've been in treatment for for years
 
05:34:47.628 --> 05:34:47.638 align:start position:0%
um I'm now blessed to work with trans
 
05:34:49.788 --> 05:34:49.798 align:start position:0%
and queer kids every day I'm a mental
 
05:34:51.530 --> 05:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
health professional in school for all
 
05:34:53.030 --> 05:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
the parents here I will say that I'm a
 
05:34:54.708 --> 05:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
mandated reporter if your kid is in
 
05:34:57.410 --> 05:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
imminent danger or has experienced abuse
 
05:34:58.910 --> 05:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
or is about to hurt themselves or other
 
05:35:00.890 --> 05:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
people you will know about it
 
05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
um and you can request your child's
 
05:35:04.970 --> 05:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
entire treatment record
 
05:35:07.368 --> 05:35:07.378 align:start position:0%
um that's your right you can do that
 
05:35:09.708 --> 05:35:09.718 align:start position:0%
um I've never had anyone do that though
 
05:35:11.570 --> 05:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
um but what brings me joy is that these
 
05:35:13.670 --> 05:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
kids that I work with they they have
 
05:35:16.730 --> 05:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
information and Power about who they are
 
05:35:19.010 --> 05:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
and who they want to come out to I
 
05:35:21.230 --> 05:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
didn't know if it was possible to like
 
05:35:23.810 --> 05:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
both men and women and non-binary people
 
05:35:26.868 --> 05:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
until I was in my early 20s like I
 
05:35:28.670 --> 05:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
didn't even know who I was and they know
 
05:35:30.708 --> 05:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
who they are and what the options are
 
05:35:32.510 --> 05:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
early on and that just brings me so much
 
05:35:36.350 --> 05:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
joy but I will say you know we don't
 
05:35:40.250 --> 05:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
have mental health issues because we're
 
05:35:41.690 --> 05:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
queer and trans we have mental health
 
05:35:44.628 --> 05:35:44.638 align:start position:0%
issues because we have to experience
 
05:35:48.230 --> 05:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
trauma from living in a transphobic and
 
05:35:50.628 --> 05:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
a homophobic Society
 
05:35:53.690 --> 05:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
um and I would just really urge you to
 
05:35:56.390 --> 05:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
05:35:59.690 --> 05:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:01.490 --> 05:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:36:10.490 --> 05:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:10.500 --> 05:36:15.590 align:start position:0%
 
ing

05:36:15.590 --> 05:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:17.868 --> 05:36:17.878 align:start position:0%
good afternoon honorable chair committee
 
05:36:20.570 --> 05:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
members uh I'm Kate Cook and I'm a city
 
05:36:22.850 --> 05:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
councilor from Portsmouth New Hampshire
 
05:36:25.550 --> 05:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
I'm here in my personal capacity today
 
05:36:29.810 --> 05:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
as a mom to a non-binary teenager
 
05:36:32.208 --> 05:36:32.218 align:start position:0%
my husband and I have worked hard to
 
05:36:34.910 --> 05:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
have a very open and loving home word is
 
05:36:38.208 --> 05:36:38.218 align:start position:0%
okay to be who you are whomever that may
 
05:36:38.218 --> 05:36:39.050 align:start position:0%
okay to be who you are whomever that may
be

05:36:39.050 --> 05:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:36:42.288 --> 05:36:42.298 align:start position:0%
my child has identified as lgbtqia plus
 
05:36:45.230 --> 05:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
since the early their early teen years
 
05:36:47.690 --> 05:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
and is an active participant in the
 
05:36:50.868 --> 05:36:50.878 align:start position:0%
gender and sexuality Alliance at school
 
05:36:53.690 --> 05:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
while I knew all of this because my
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
child is very comfortable sharing most
 
05:36:57.890 --> 05:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
everything at home with us
 
05:37:00.288 --> 05:37:00.298 align:start position:0%
I did not know that my child identified
 
05:37:02.270 --> 05:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
as non-binary and used they them
 
05:37:05.510 --> 05:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
pronouns at school until this year
 
05:37:08.390 --> 05:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
why didn't I know that especially if my
 
05:37:10.610 --> 05:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
child is so comfortable and feel safe in
 
05:37:11.930 --> 05:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
my home
 
05:37:14.090 --> 05:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
because my child was nervous about
 
05:37:16.550 --> 05:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
telling me not because I wouldn't accept
 
05:37:19.310 --> 05:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
them as non-binary but because they did
 
05:37:21.050 --> 05:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
not want me to know that they were not
 
05:37:23.510 --> 05:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
going by then they were going by a name
 
05:37:26.030 --> 05:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
other than the one that I gave them
 
05:37:27.708 --> 05:37:27.718 align:start position:0%
they knew that it was important to me
 
05:37:29.868 --> 05:37:29.878 align:start position:0%
that I had named them after my beloved
 
05:37:29.878 --> 05:37:31.010 align:start position:0%
that I had named them after my beloved
grandmother

05:37:31.010 --> 05:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
grandmother
 
05:37:33.410 --> 05:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
and they did not want to upset me that
 
05:37:35.868 --> 05:37:35.878 align:start position:0%
they they were not using that name and
 
05:37:37.070 --> 05:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
they were using a different name at
 
05:37:37.080 --> 05:37:38.570 align:start position:0%
they were using a different name at
school

05:37:38.570 --> 05:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:37:41.570 --> 05:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
I was actually stunned to find this out
 
05:37:43.850 --> 05:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
but we're a very loving and caring we
 
05:37:45.890 --> 05:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
have a very loving and caring home where
 
05:37:47.930 --> 05:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
we are completely accepting of all
 
05:37:47.940 --> 05:37:49.010 align:start position:0%
we are completely accepting of all
people

05:37:49.010 --> 05:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:37:51.230 --> 05:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
we have long had family and friends who
 
05:37:52.810 --> 05:37:52.820 align:start position:0%
are transgender
 
05:37:56.690 --> 05:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
so again my child was not afraid of
 
05:37:58.788 --> 05:37:58.798 align:start position:0%
letting me know that they were gender
 
05:38:00.708 --> 05:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
non-conforming they were afraid that
 
05:38:02.150 --> 05:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
that I would be upset that they weren't
 
05:38:04.788 --> 05:38:04.798 align:start position:0%
using my grandmother's name
 
05:38:06.650 --> 05:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
and to find something out like that was
 
05:38:09.830 --> 05:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
upsetting for me but what it told me was
 
05:38:13.010 --> 05:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
that my child felt safe at school
 
05:38:15.948 --> 05:38:15.958 align:start position:0%
felt safe being themselves in the school
 
05:38:18.948 --> 05:38:18.958 align:start position:0%
setting and that made me feel good about
 
05:38:22.730 --> 05:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
my child that my child was happy
 
05:38:25.730 --> 05:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
and well adjusted in school that's the
 
05:38:28.910 --> 05:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
most important thing to me as a parent
 
05:38:32.390 --> 05:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
that my child is a happy person
 
05:38:34.490 --> 05:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
and has a happy life
 
05:38:36.948 --> 05:38:36.958 align:start position:0%
not what I know or don't know about my
 
05:38:38.750 --> 05:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
child we can't ever know everything
 
05:38:42.230 --> 05:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
about our teenagers
 
05:38:45.470 --> 05:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
if my child was nervous about sharing
 
05:38:48.530 --> 05:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
with me imagine a gender non-conforming
 
05:38:50.208 --> 05:38:50.218 align:start position:0%
child with parents who did not accept
 
05:38:51.770 --> 05:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
their gender identity or sexual
 
05:38:51.780 --> 05:38:53.448 align:start position:0%
their gender identity or sexual
orientation

05:38:53.448 --> 05:38:53.458 align:start position:0%
orientation
 
05:38:55.430 --> 05:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
it would be impossible for that child to
 
05:38:57.050 --> 05:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
trust any adult at school with their
 
05:38:58.970 --> 05:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
identity for fear of disclosure of their
 
05:39:01.368 --> 05:39:01.378 align:start position:0%
identity to to their parents who would
 
05:39:04.250 --> 05:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
reject them or Worse abuse them
 
05:39:05.990 --> 05:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
emotionally or physically for not
 
05:39:08.868 --> 05:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
conforming to heterosexual gender norms
 
05:39:10.610 --> 05:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
this bill will drive gender
 
05:39:12.470 --> 05:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
non-conforming students back into the
 
05:39:14.330 --> 05:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
closet because they will fear they will
 
05:39:17.150 --> 05:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
have to be outed for whatever reason if
 
05:39:18.650 --> 05:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
your goal is to make young people feel
 
05:39:21.110 --> 05:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
unsafe you're at school time is up
 
05:39:23.448 --> 05:39:23.458 align:start position:0%
to feel they have have no one they can
 
05:39:25.910 --> 05:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
trust then you'll succeed if you pass
 
05:39:28.730 --> 05:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
this bill if you care about all of our
 
05:39:31.070 --> 05:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
children then you'll oppose it
 
05:39:32.448 --> 05:39:32.458 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:39:40.610 --> 05:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:42.830 --> 05:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing us today
 
05:39:44.330 --> 05:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
I wanted to bring to your attention
 
05:39:46.190 --> 05:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
something very disturbing that was
 
05:39:49.490 --> 05:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
posted on social media it reads as a
 
05:39:52.190 --> 05:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
third grade teacher I keep a cross on my
 
05:39:54.590 --> 05:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
wall it often provokes questions from
 
05:39:55.730 --> 05:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
the children
 
05:39:57.890 --> 05:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
most are excited to hear about my faith
 
05:40:00.650 --> 05:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
they point to the cross on the wall and
 
05:40:03.110 --> 05:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
I tell them about the resurrection
 
05:40:04.970 --> 05:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
you need to understand I'm not
 
05:40:07.490 --> 05:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
indoctrinating these children they come
 
05:40:10.128 --> 05:40:10.138 align:start position:0%
to me and I follow their questions back
 
05:40:11.810 --> 05:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
to its source
 
05:40:13.970 --> 05:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
some have even gotten baptized in the
 
05:40:16.010 --> 05:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
sink as long as they don't tell their
 
05:40:19.070 --> 05:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
parents it's our secret I tell them guys
 
05:40:20.868 --> 05:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
it's important that we keep this a
 
05:40:20.878 --> 05:40:21.948 align:start position:0%
it's important that we keep this a
secret

05:40:21.948 --> 05:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
secret
 
05:40:23.750 --> 05:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
these kids feel something is not right
 
05:40:25.610 --> 05:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
inside them and I help them to
 
05:40:28.070 --> 05:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
understand that possibly Jesus is what
 
05:40:29.810 --> 05:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
they're missing
 
05:40:32.030 --> 05:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
another teacher writes during summer
 
05:40:34.670 --> 05:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
school I have a holy closet
 
05:40:36.410 --> 05:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
where my Curious students can get
 
05:40:38.410 --> 05:40:38.420 align:start position:0%
religious books and dress-up clothes
 
05:40:41.270 --> 05:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
yasmine's parents are Muslims but she's
 
05:40:43.250 --> 05:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
always felt more like a Catholic and is
 
05:40:44.930 --> 05:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
afraid to tell them
 
05:40:47.810 --> 05:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
here she is free to read the Bible and
 
05:40:50.750 --> 05:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
be sister Yasmine All Summer Long
 
05:40:53.570 --> 05:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
how incensed are we that a teacher would
 
05:40:55.850 --> 05:40:55.860 align:start position:0%
use their position to indoctrinate the
 
05:40:58.670 --> 05:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
children they are paid to educate and
 
05:41:00.770 --> 05:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
then add insult to injury by teaching
 
05:41:02.330 --> 05:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
them to keep it a secret from their
 
05:41:02.340 --> 05:41:03.470 align:start position:0%
them to keep it a secret from their
parents

05:41:03.470 --> 05:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
parents
 
05:41:05.270 --> 05:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
here's the most important part of this
 
05:41:07.910 --> 05:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
story those posts weren't real they were
 
05:41:10.128 --> 05:41:10.138 align:start position:0%
satire those teachers aren't really
 
05:41:11.930 --> 05:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
doing those things they were pointing
 
05:41:13.670 --> 05:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
out hypocrisy
 
05:41:15.470 --> 05:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
thinking it was real many people
 
05:41:17.990 --> 05:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
responded with outrage
 
05:41:20.208 --> 05:41:20.218 align:start position:0%
overall the thing that made people the
 
05:41:22.368 --> 05:41:22.378 align:start position:0%
most angry was children being told to
 
05:41:24.890 --> 05:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
keep secrets from parents many of them
 
05:41:27.470 --> 05:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
equated secrets to grooming and yes they
 
05:41:29.208 --> 05:41:29.218 align:start position:0%
actually used that word when they
 
05:41:30.650 --> 05:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
thought it was being used against a
 
05:41:30.660 --> 05:41:32.090 align:start position:0%
thought it was being used against a
Christian

05:41:32.090 --> 05:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
Christian
 
05:41:34.850 --> 05:41:34.860 align:start position:0%
what if teachers decided their proniums
 
05:41:37.670 --> 05:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
were child of God daughter of the king
 
05:41:40.490 --> 05:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
and students had to use them
 
05:41:42.230 --> 05:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
you know it would lead to discussions
 
05:41:45.050 --> 05:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
about Christianity from children
 
05:41:47.628 --> 05:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
people were outraged when it came to
 
05:41:49.670 --> 05:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
parents not knowing what their children
 
05:41:52.070 --> 05:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
are being taught outraged about a
 
05:41:53.330 --> 05:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
teacher discussing their personal
 
05:41:55.868 --> 05:41:55.878 align:start position:0%
beliefs and Lifestyles to their children
 
05:41:58.368 --> 05:41:58.378 align:start position:0%
outraged about being left in the dark
 
05:42:00.830 --> 05:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
about a philosophy or lifestyle being
 
05:42:03.770 --> 05:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
discussed behind their back
 
05:42:06.410 --> 05:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
how did you feel when you thought a
 
05:42:08.628 --> 05:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
teacher was actually baptizing children
 
05:42:11.350 --> 05:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
or displaying symbols of Christianity
 
05:42:14.510 --> 05:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
Christianity in his classroom knowing it
 
05:42:17.330 --> 05:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
would lead to conversations if that made
 
05:42:20.448 --> 05:42:20.458 align:start position:0%
you angry and yet you opposed this bill
 
05:42:23.868 --> 05:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
then ask yourself if you in fact are a
 
05:42:23.878 --> 05:42:24.948 align:start position:0%
then ask yourself if you in fact are a
hypocrite

05:42:24.948 --> 05:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
hypocrite
 
05:42:27.110 --> 05:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
children should never be taught to keep
 
05:42:29.090 --> 05:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
secrets from their parents in fact they
 
05:42:30.770 --> 05:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
should be taught that anyone who tells
 
05:42:32.510 --> 05:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
them to keep secrets from their parents
 
05:42:35.390 --> 05:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
is dangerous please support this bill
 
05:42:37.610 --> 05:42:37.620 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of things I'd like to
 
05:42:39.530 --> 05:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
address your time is up okay thank you
 
05:42:43.010 --> 05:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Roger blow
 
05:42:43.020 --> 05:42:48.470 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Roger blow
bleau

05:42:48.470 --> 05:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:51.410 --> 05:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
I'm very much opposed to this bill I
 
05:42:52.910 --> 05:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
just want to tell you all I I think I'm
 
05:42:54.288 --> 05:42:54.298 align:start position:0%
a very good dad
 
05:42:57.350 --> 05:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
and when my daughter turned 20 after
 
05:42:59.270 --> 05:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
having been out in college for a couple
 
05:43:01.430 --> 05:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
years she
 
05:43:03.948 --> 05:43:03.958 align:start position:0%
realized that she was a lesbian
 
05:43:06.708 --> 05:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
her dad was homophobic at the time
 
05:43:09.170 --> 05:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
she was afraid to tell me the rest of my
 
05:43:11.868 --> 05:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
immediate family knew but I didn't know
 
05:43:13.850 --> 05:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
so when she came out to me she says Dad
 
05:43:17.090 --> 05:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
I want you to love me or who I am not
 
05:43:18.948 --> 05:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
who you think I am
 
05:43:22.010 --> 05:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what adults she confided
 
05:43:25.190 --> 05:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
in who she needed to have support for
 
05:43:26.868 --> 05:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
all that time but I'm glad they were
 
05:43:28.970 --> 05:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
there for her because I think it does
 
05:43:30.830 --> 05:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
take a village
 
05:43:33.288 --> 05:43:33.298 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say another time I was
 
05:43:34.730 --> 05:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
coaching Little League
 
05:43:37.190 --> 05:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
and another coach and I decided to go
 
05:43:39.288 --> 05:43:39.298 align:start position:0%
see this the parents of this kid because
 
05:43:41.750 --> 05:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
he was a nice kid but he missed a lot of
 
05:43:43.970 --> 05:43:43.980 align:start position:0%
practices and we really emphasized that
 
05:43:45.770 --> 05:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
so we went to the kids house together
 
05:43:48.948 --> 05:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
when the father opened the door our
 
05:43:51.470 --> 05:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
sense was this guy was unsafe for this
 
05:43:53.750 --> 05:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
kid so we kept it secret from him that
 
05:43:55.490 --> 05:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
his his son was missing practices
 
05:43:58.128 --> 05:43:58.138 align:start position:0%
because that was too dangerous I believe
 
05:44:00.770 --> 05:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
in teachers so much they give so much I
 
05:44:03.410 --> 05:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
had an act that was never married I said
 
05:44:04.610 --> 05:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
do you feel bad you didn't have any kids
 
05:44:06.590 --> 05:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
she said I had thousands of kids she
 
05:44:08.150 --> 05:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
loved all those kids she did everything
 
05:44:10.490 --> 05:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
they could they have all these IEPs for
 
05:44:12.170 --> 05:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
Teacher they have to teach one kid one
 
05:44:13.190 --> 05:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
way they'll teach another kid another
 
05:44:14.990 --> 05:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
way there's different races religions
 
05:44:18.170 --> 05:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
genders they have so much and they love
 
05:44:20.330 --> 05:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
these kids they try they're hired us to
 
05:44:23.510 --> 05:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
do this and I want a kid to be able to
 
05:44:25.970 --> 05:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
go to a trusted teacher a guidance
 
05:44:28.430 --> 05:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
counselor to to keep their secrets to
 
05:44:29.930 --> 05:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
help them until they're ready my
 
05:44:32.090 --> 05:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
daughter waited till she was 20 to come
 
05:44:34.490 --> 05:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
up to me how about these kids what are
 
05:44:35.690 --> 05:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
they going if they're confused they want
 
05:44:38.570 --> 05:44:38.580 align:start position:0%
to know and and I really think that this
 
05:44:41.208 --> 05:44:41.218 align:start position:0%
is kind of a cultural War you know I
 
05:44:42.530 --> 05:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
think the
 
05:44:44.510 --> 05:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
um the legislature is getting in the way
 
05:44:45.830 --> 05:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
of teachers is getting away at Medical
 
05:44:48.048 --> 05:44:48.058 align:start position:0%
things we don't want to teach CIT we
 
05:44:50.030 --> 05:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to teach lgbtq et cetera et
 
05:44:52.670 --> 05:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
cetera I think it's good if if kids know
 
05:44:54.948 --> 05:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
all about their world when I was in
 
05:44:54.958 --> 05:44:56.150 align:start position:0%
all about their world when I was in
Vietnam

05:44:56.150 --> 05:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
Vietnam
 
05:45:00.830 --> 05:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
I had r r in Australia when we when we
 
05:45:04.250 --> 05:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
got to uh Australia we had the chaplain
 
05:45:06.590 --> 05:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
talk to all of us and he said in this
 
05:45:08.270 --> 05:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
country if you're caught with drugs
 
05:45:10.128 --> 05:45:10.138 align:start position:0%
you're going to jail they taught us
 
05:45:11.868 --> 05:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
about the culture that we had to go into
 
05:45:13.548 --> 05:45:13.558 align:start position:0%
well our cultures are all over the place
 
05:45:15.350 --> 05:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
in the United States but that doesn't
 
05:45:17.868 --> 05:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
mean one family loves their people more
 
05:45:20.030 --> 05:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
than the others so I think this bill
 
05:45:22.910 --> 05:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
will hurt kids and I have lgbtq family
 
05:45:25.250 --> 05:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
and I don't want them hurt and I don't
 
05:45:26.628 --> 05:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
want them being ratted on like another
 
05:45:28.490 --> 05:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
kid says oh you know what tell the
 
05:45:30.048 --> 05:45:30.058 align:start position:0%
teacher that this this person might be
 
05:45:31.610 --> 05:45:31.620 align:start position:0%
gay oh let's get this person you know
 
05:45:32.690 --> 05:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
what I mean it's gonna be all that kind
 
05:45:35.090 --> 05:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
of stuff it reminds me of when I I when
 
05:45:37.850 --> 05:45:37.860 align:start position:0%
I read about uh Hitler having children
 
05:45:40.490 --> 05:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
ratting on different people you know I I
 
05:45:42.530 --> 05:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
really think that's bad so I just want
 
05:45:44.150 --> 05:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
to say thank you for listening and
 
05:45:46.190 --> 05:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
please vote against this bill protect
 
05:45:49.070 --> 05:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
people thank you thank you
 
05:46:04.430 --> 05:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:06.410 --> 05:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for calling me I thought I was
 
05:46:07.788 --> 05:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
going to miss work
 
05:46:07.798 --> 05:46:09.230 align:start position:0%
going to miss work
so

05:46:09.230 --> 05:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:46:10.670 --> 05:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:46:13.128 --> 05:46:13.138 align:start position:0%
I'm I only have a couple of minutes so
 
05:46:16.548 --> 05:46:16.558 align:start position:0%
I'm going to get to the chase I I've uh
 
05:46:18.170 --> 05:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
I'm a Christian
 
05:46:22.010 --> 05:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
I worked in human services for 45 years
 
05:46:24.890 --> 05:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
I also was chair of the school board and
 
05:46:26.990 --> 05:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
on the school board in Fremont as well
 
05:46:29.868 --> 05:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
as a budget committee and my last job
 
05:46:32.690 --> 05:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
well before I retired I'm working
 
05:46:35.990 --> 05:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
temporarily now I was a liaison with
 
05:46:37.850 --> 05:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities
 
05:46:41.330 --> 05:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
and if you want to hear about abuse
 
05:46:43.190 --> 05:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
people suffered
 
05:46:46.368 --> 05:46:46.378 align:start position:0%
I could make your blood curl
 
05:46:48.470 --> 05:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
but that never was an excuse for the
 
05:46:50.330 --> 05:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
crime that they committed
 
05:46:52.250 --> 05:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
I held them responsible
 
05:46:54.170 --> 05:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
and the reason is is because as a
 
05:46:55.730 --> 05:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
Christian I believe that there is a
 
05:46:57.230 --> 05:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
right and wrong
 
05:46:59.350 --> 05:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
we have a moral
 
05:47:02.208 --> 05:47:02.218 align:start position:0%
responsibility before God and before
 
05:47:04.368 --> 05:47:04.378 align:start position:0%
each other
 
05:47:06.948 --> 05:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
and parents the Bible tells parents to
 
05:47:09.170 --> 05:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
train up a child the way they should go
 
05:47:12.170 --> 05:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
and he will not depart from it
 
05:47:16.010 --> 05:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
it's a parent's responsibility to impart
 
05:47:19.070 --> 05:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
the moral the right morals the morals
 
05:47:22.010 --> 05:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
that kids need that we need to to work
 
05:47:26.628 --> 05:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
and abide by to remain a free Society
 
05:47:28.788 --> 05:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
what we have here is two competing
 
05:47:28.798 --> 05:47:31.310 align:start position:0%
what we have here is two competing
philosophies

05:47:31.310 --> 05:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
philosophies
 
05:47:33.230 --> 05:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
we have the philosophies of Classical
 
05:47:35.930 --> 05:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
liberalism which says we live in a a
 
05:47:37.910 --> 05:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
universe Guided by both physical and
 
05:47:39.650 --> 05:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
moral rules
 
05:47:41.448 --> 05:47:41.458 align:start position:0%
and we have the philosophy of the
 
05:47:44.030 --> 05:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
philosophs of France Revolution
 
05:47:46.910 --> 05:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
who taught that Civilization is bad
 
05:47:49.430 --> 05:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
the civilization was a problem of all of
 
05:47:50.990 --> 05:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
all Humanity
 
05:47:53.270 --> 05:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
because it prevented them from living
 
05:47:56.270 --> 05:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
and experiencing and living the life
 
05:47:58.610 --> 05:47:58.620 align:start position:0%
they wanted to live Rousseau thought
 
05:48:00.948 --> 05:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
marriage was a waste of time
 
05:48:03.410 --> 05:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
because it prevented him from having fun
 
05:48:05.330 --> 05:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
and he loved the French orphanages
 
05:48:06.530 --> 05:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
because the place he could put his
 
05:48:06.540 --> 05:48:07.430 align:start position:0%
because the place he could put his
children

05:48:07.430 --> 05:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:48:10.368 --> 05:48:10.378 align:start position:0%
that he had out of wedlock
 
05:48:13.548 --> 05:48:13.558 align:start position:0%
the the philosophs yearned for a
 
05:48:15.110 --> 05:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
philosopher king
 
05:48:18.530 --> 05:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
right now they yearn for a all-knowing
 
05:48:18.540 --> 05:48:21.048 align:start position:0%
right now they yearn for a all-knowing
bureaucracy

05:48:21.048 --> 05:48:21.058 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy
 
05:48:23.868 --> 05:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
that knows everything it can take care
 
05:48:25.190 --> 05:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
of us
 
05:48:28.430 --> 05:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
it can make decisions for us
 
05:48:31.548 --> 05:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
and yet God did not imbue a bureaucracy
 
05:48:33.890 --> 05:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
through the responsibility to bring them
 
05:48:35.930 --> 05:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
up our kids
 
05:48:39.770 --> 05:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:42.410 --> 05:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
think about that
 
05:48:45.830 --> 05:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
Joshua when he about to die confronted
 
05:48:45.840 --> 05:48:47.690 align:start position:0%
Joshua when he about to die confronted
Israel

05:48:47.690 --> 05:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
Israel
 
05:48:51.530 --> 05:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:54.230 --> 05:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
I think it's up for our elected
 
05:48:56.208 --> 05:48:56.218 align:start position:0%
representatives too I offer that same
 
05:48:57.770 --> 05:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
challenge to you
 
05:48:59.990 --> 05:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
choose you this day
 
05:49:03.530 --> 05:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
which kind of society do you want
 
05:49:07.190 --> 05:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
a sign a society based on physical and
 
05:49:09.890 --> 05:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
moral rules
 
05:49:12.470 --> 05:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
or one that's based on
 
05:49:17.510 --> 05:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:17.520 --> 05:49:19.128 align:start position:0%
 
Nancy

05:49:19.128 --> 05:49:19.138 align:start position:0%
Nancy
 
05:49:26.570 --> 05:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:30.048 --> 05:49:30.058 align:start position:0%
okay let's see if I can
 
05:49:31.548 --> 05:49:31.558 align:start position:0%
how's that
 
05:49:31.558 --> 05:49:36.230 align:start position:0%
how's that
good

05:49:36.230 --> 05:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:38.570 --> 05:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
uh for the record I'm Nancy Marland I
 
05:49:40.788 --> 05:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
live in Sugar Hill the lovely mountain
 
05:49:40.798 --> 05:49:41.990 align:start position:0%
live in Sugar Hill the lovely mountain
town

05:49:41.990 --> 05:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
town
 
05:49:44.628 --> 05:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
I have a PhD in child development and I
 
05:49:47.390 --> 05:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
spent my entire working life working
 
05:49:50.270 --> 05:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
with Children and Families
 
05:49:55.010 --> 05:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
and I have to say SB 272 is fascinating
 
05:49:57.410 --> 05:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
it enumerates a long list of parental
 
05:49:59.570 --> 05:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
rights most of which are already enacted
 
05:50:01.548 --> 05:50:01.558 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire statute as we've
 
05:50:03.890 --> 05:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
heard repeatedly today
 
05:50:07.070 --> 05:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
so what problem exactly are we trying to
 
05:50:09.410 --> 05:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
fix with this bill
 
05:50:11.150 --> 05:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
I have an opinion
 
05:50:13.610 --> 05:50:13.620 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk about honesty
 
05:50:15.350 --> 05:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
in this room today
 
05:50:18.470 --> 05:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
and I think that the honest truth is
 
05:50:22.730 --> 05:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:25.788 --> 05:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
is a deceitful attempt to give cover to
 
05:50:28.368 --> 05:50:28.378 align:start position:0%
harassment of transgender kids by
 
05:50:30.708 --> 05:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
including it in an otherwise benign list
 
05:50:33.350 --> 05:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
of Legally existing rights that schools
 
05:50:36.350 --> 05:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
already observe and everyone agrees with
 
05:50:40.610 --> 05:50:40.620 align:start position:0%
the only specific behaviors named in SB
 
05:50:44.628 --> 05:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
272 relate to transgender youngsters
 
05:50:47.930 --> 05:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
if the legislature is so concerned that
 
05:50:49.788 --> 05:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
parents be informed of their kids
 
05:50:52.970 --> 05:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
behaviors why is gender identity the
 
05:50:55.850 --> 05:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
only one mentioned
 
05:50:59.448 --> 05:50:59.458 align:start position:0%
sexual activity sexual assault bullying
 
05:51:04.548 --> 05:51:04.558 align:start position:0%
risky Behavior depression SB 272 is
 
05:51:07.128 --> 05:51:07.138 align:start position:0%
silent on these matters
 
05:51:10.070 --> 05:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
surely if the state's interest or kids
 
05:51:10.080 --> 05:51:11.390 align:start position:0%
surely if the state's interest or kids
welfare

05:51:11.390 --> 05:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
welfare
 
05:51:13.670 --> 05:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
these areas of concern would be included
 
05:51:17.090 --> 05:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
as things parents should know about
 
05:51:20.090 --> 05:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
if transgender kids choose not to inform
 
05:51:22.430 --> 05:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
their parents of their gender identity
 
05:51:24.890 --> 05:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
there is a reason we have heard that
 
05:51:28.070 --> 05:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
fully explored all day
 
05:51:30.350 --> 05:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
parents who cannot accept a child's
 
05:51:33.410 --> 05:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
identity can reject them abuse them harm
 
05:51:36.830 --> 05:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
them physically and emotionally
 
05:51:40.190 --> 05:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
and I have to say in my experience when
 
05:51:42.708 --> 05:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
a child comes to a teacher
 
05:51:44.270 --> 05:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
with an issue
 
05:51:46.190 --> 05:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
one of the first things that a teacher
 
05:51:48.590 --> 05:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
will try to do is encourage that child
 
05:51:50.390 --> 05:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
to speak to their parents about it
 
05:51:53.090 --> 05:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
that's just standard practice I don't
 
05:51:54.650 --> 05:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
know where people are getting this idea
 
05:51:58.788 --> 05:51:58.798 align:start position:0%

forcing School Personnel to betray the
 
05:52:04.310 --> 05:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
trust of these kids by outing them to
 
05:52:07.010 --> 05:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
their parents is cruel and infringes on
 
05:52:09.350 --> 05:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
the privacy of the minor child
 
05:52:11.390 --> 05:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
for vulnerable youngsters the presence
 
05:52:14.150 --> 05:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
in their lives of a trusted non-family
 
05:52:16.368 --> 05:52:16.378 align:start position:0%
adult can make a Monumental difference
 
05:52:19.610 --> 05:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
this is supported in study after study
 
05:52:22.788 --> 05:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
in the psychological literature
 
05:52:27.170 --> 05:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
SB 272 removes trusted teachers coaches
 
05:52:30.170 --> 05:52:30.180 align:start position:0%
and counselors from this role your time
 
05:52:33.770 --> 05:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
is up can I conclude with one last thing
 
05:52:36.470 --> 05:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
I can only assume that the sponsors of
 
05:52:38.868 --> 05:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
this bill have never had a beloved
 
05:52:42.048 --> 05:52:42.058 align:start position:0%
grandchild come to them Terror and hope
 
05:52:45.470 --> 05:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
in their soft young eyes and say
 
05:52:48.650 --> 05:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
nanny I am non-binary because if they
 
05:52:50.990 --> 05:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
had there would be only one course for
 
05:52:52.850 --> 05:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
them to take and that would be to
 
05:52:55.368 --> 05:52:55.378 align:start position:0%
protect time is up that grandchild by
 
05:52:58.090 --> 05:52:58.100 align:start position:0%
voting against this Bill thank you
 
05:53:09.470 --> 05:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:14.208 --> 05:53:14.218 align:start position:0%
good afternoon we made it okay I am a
 
05:53:16.128 --> 05:53:16.138 align:start position:0%
mother and a former teacher of 15 years
 
05:53:18.110 --> 05:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
and I have a question for all of you
 
05:53:20.750 --> 05:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
have you ever wondered where the line is
 
05:53:23.030 --> 05:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
and speaking of the line in society that
 
05:53:25.310 --> 05:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
we never crossed with children when
 
05:53:27.048 --> 05:53:27.058 align:start position:0%
adults were talking the children were
 
05:53:28.730 --> 05:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
told to leave the room because some
 
05:53:31.548 --> 05:53:31.558 align:start position:0%
topics were not for young ears topics
 
05:53:33.830 --> 05:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
such as religion politics and sex were
 
05:53:36.170 --> 05:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
not discussed at school teachers never
 
05:53:38.150 --> 05:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
discussed their viewpoints on any topic
 
05:53:39.948 --> 05:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
and we never knew anything about their
 
05:53:41.868 --> 05:53:41.878 align:start position:0%
lives in fact some of my students
 
05:53:43.610 --> 05:53:43.620 align:start position:0%
thought I lived at school
 
05:53:45.530 --> 05:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
slowly over the past 10 years that line
 
05:53:47.810 --> 05:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
has been blurred and even erased some
 
05:53:49.610 --> 05:53:49.620 align:start position:0%
teachers have decided to become students
 
05:53:51.288 --> 05:53:51.298 align:start position:0%
friends and confidence
 
05:53:53.628 --> 05:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
with that comes power influence over
 
05:53:55.788 --> 05:53:55.798 align:start position:0%
what a child thinks and feels while
 
05:53:57.590 --> 05:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
they've been sitting here I have seen
 
05:54:01.368 --> 05:54:01.378 align:start position:0%
two news articles of recent arrests and
 
05:54:03.770 --> 05:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
convictions of school personnels and
 
05:54:05.990 --> 05:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
teachers and of sexual assault on
 
05:54:06.000 --> 05:54:07.368 align:start position:0%
teachers and of sexual assault on
children

05:54:07.368 --> 05:54:07.378 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:54:10.430 --> 05:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
please teachers are human beings they
 
05:54:13.070 --> 05:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
should not be put up on pedestals and
 
05:54:15.288 --> 05:54:15.298 align:start position:0%
all I've heard today is a lot of attacks
 
05:54:17.510 --> 05:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
on parents but we do still have a
 
05:54:19.128 --> 05:54:19.138 align:start position:0%
problem in the schools
 
05:54:21.530 --> 05:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
and no a background check is not going
 
05:54:23.930 --> 05:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
to secure that a school Personnel is
 
05:54:25.610 --> 05:54:25.620 align:start position:0%
safe because they have not been
 
05:54:25.620 --> 05:54:27.110 align:start position:0%
safe because they have not been
convicted

05:54:27.110 --> 05:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
convicted
 
05:54:29.330 --> 05:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
as a former teacher of grades K to eight
 
05:54:30.770 --> 05:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
with a master's degree I can speak
 
05:54:32.030 --> 05:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
freely today
 
05:54:33.890 --> 05:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
many teachers out there would like to
 
05:54:35.930 --> 05:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
stand up and support parent rights but
 
05:54:37.730 --> 05:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
fear for their jobs and repercussions
 
05:54:39.288 --> 05:54:39.298 align:start position:0%
against their own children if they do
 
05:54:40.850 --> 05:54:40.860 align:start position:0%
speak up
 
05:54:43.010 --> 05:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
School Personnel do not want to insert
 
05:54:45.230 --> 05:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
themselves into a role as a parental
 
05:54:47.570 --> 05:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
proxy and hide important facts from a
 
05:54:49.788 --> 05:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
child's parents they only want to teach
 
05:54:51.708 --> 05:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
the academic skills that they were hired
 
05:54:52.788 --> 05:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:54:54.110 --> 05:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
there have been many times where I've
 
05:54:55.490 --> 05:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
had to call parents about what their
 
05:54:57.590 --> 05:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
child has confided to me I did this
 
05:54:59.930 --> 05:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
because it's the right thing to do many
 
05:55:01.610 --> 05:55:01.620 align:start position:0%
times a student would rather I not call
 
05:55:03.288 --> 05:55:03.298 align:start position:0%
but that's not the role the teacher to
 
05:55:05.570 --> 05:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
come between a parent and their child
 
05:55:07.910 --> 05:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
no school employee has the right or the
 
05:55:09.948 --> 05:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
privilege to keep any information a
 
05:55:11.810 --> 05:55:11.820 align:start position:0%
child shares with them from a parent
 
05:55:14.628 --> 05:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
except under rare circumstances
 
05:55:17.150 --> 05:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
School Employees who only know a child
 
05:55:19.670 --> 05:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
for a blink of an eye versus a parent
 
05:55:22.430 --> 05:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
who has known their child for years are
 
05:55:24.948 --> 05:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
not a child's friend or parent that line
 
05:55:27.350 --> 05:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
should never be crossed you may be
 
05:55:29.030 --> 05:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
wondering how the line was blurred or
 
05:55:31.368 --> 05:55:31.378 align:start position:0%
even erased in New Hampshire the New
 
05:55:33.350 --> 05:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire School Board Association sends
 
05:55:35.448 --> 05:55:35.458 align:start position:0%
out suggested policy for member School
 
05:55:38.628 --> 05:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
boards to adopt and in 2015 the School
 
05:55:40.610 --> 05:55:40.620 align:start position:0%
Board Association proposed a policy
 
05:55:44.270 --> 05:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
called jbab Dash R would propose that
 
05:55:46.250 --> 05:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
schools were to lie to parents about
 
05:55:48.048 --> 05:55:48.058 align:start position:0%
their child's activities and discussions
 
05:55:49.610 --> 05:55:49.620 align:start position:0%
with school personnel
 
05:55:51.530 --> 05:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
the School Board Association is a
 
05:55:52.970 --> 05:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
non-profit organization that is
 
05:55:55.128 --> 05:55:55.138 align:start position:0%
supported by your tax money through
 
05:55:58.128 --> 05:55:58.138 align:start position:0%
annual dues that your school board pays
 
05:56:01.670 --> 05:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
this organization has over 2.5 million
 
05:56:03.530 --> 05:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
dollars in assets that's your tax
 
05:56:05.930 --> 05:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
dollars to spend on lobbying not for
 
05:56:07.368 --> 05:56:07.378 align:start position:0%
your children but to protect School
 
05:56:07.378 --> 05:56:08.690 align:start position:0%
your children but to protect School
Administrations

05:56:08.690 --> 05:56:08.700 align:start position:0%
Administrations
 
05:56:10.670 --> 05:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
some would say parents have these rights
 
05:56:13.610 --> 05:56:13.620 align:start position:0%
listed in SC 272 already and that
 
05:56:15.890 --> 05:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
current law protects these rights so far
 
05:56:18.110 --> 05:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
that is not true as parental rights are
 
05:56:19.788 --> 05:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
being denied by multiple School boards
 
05:56:23.030 --> 05:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire please pass SB 72
 
05:56:25.970 --> 05:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
for parents thank you
 
05:56:33.048 --> 05:56:33.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:34.850 --> 05:56:34.860 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Chris ribbett and I'd
 
05:56:38.030 --> 05:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
like to to testify in support of of 272.
 
05:56:42.288 --> 05:56:42.298 align:start position:0%
I am a parent of an elementary child in
 
05:56:44.930 --> 05:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I am also a high school
 
05:56:47.330 --> 05:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
science teacher at a public school I
 
05:56:49.610 --> 05:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
will read part of an activity that our
 
05:56:52.430 --> 05:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
local school conducts without notifying
 
05:56:54.830 --> 05:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
parents and I would like you to imagine
 
05:56:57.230 --> 05:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
that I am speaking to your child or you
 
05:57:00.770 --> 05:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
at age five this is the care for kids
 
05:57:08.170 --> 05:57:08.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:10.730 --> 05:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
now that we have talked about our bodies
 
05:57:13.128 --> 05:57:13.138 align:start position:0%
and our public and private parts we are
 
05:57:15.530 --> 05:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
going to do an activity we are going to
 
05:57:18.048 --> 05:57:18.058 align:start position:0%
trace our bodies and then you can draw
 
05:57:20.690 --> 05:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
your body just as it looks when you come
 
05:57:22.970 --> 05:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
out of the bathtub or shower
 
05:57:25.368 --> 05:57:25.378 align:start position:0%
our school is asking our five-year-old
 
05:57:27.890 --> 05:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
children to draw themselves naked
 
05:57:31.208 --> 05:57:31.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:36.650 --> 05:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:39.708 --> 05:57:39.718 align:start position:0%
to say if a child is hesitant about
 
05:57:42.230 --> 05:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
drawing you can gently suggest adding
 
05:57:43.548 --> 05:57:43.558 align:start position:0%
more parts
 
05:57:46.070 --> 05:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
can you add your elbows how about your
 
05:57:48.350 --> 05:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
fingernails a penis
 
05:57:51.288 --> 05:57:51.298 align:start position:0%
another useful approach is to offer to
 
05:57:52.730 --> 05:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
draw for them
 
05:57:54.470 --> 05:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
where would you like me to put the
 
05:57:54.480 --> 05:57:57.110 align:start position:0%
where would you like me to put the
nipples

05:57:57.110 --> 05:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:59.090 --> 05:57:59.100 align:start position:0%
when my wife and I brought up our
 
05:58:02.270 --> 05:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
concerns that not notifying parents
 
05:58:04.730 --> 05:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
about this activity in advance is in
 
05:58:09.590 --> 05:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
violation of state law 186 9 section 9.
 
05:58:12.110 --> 05:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
the guidance counselor acting principal
 
05:58:14.628 --> 05:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
and superintendent dismiss them and
 
05:58:16.250 --> 05:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
assured us that this program was age
 
05:58:19.490 --> 05:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
appropriate not sexual education and no
 
05:58:21.350 --> 05:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
notice was necessary
 
05:58:22.910 --> 05:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
we brought up her concerns to the
 
05:58:24.708 --> 05:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and they
 
05:58:26.270 --> 05:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
recommended we resolve our issues
 
05:58:26.280 --> 05:58:27.350 align:start position:0%
recommended we resolve our issues
locally

05:58:27.350 --> 05:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
locally
 
05:58:28.970 --> 05:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
the school said that they would notify
 
05:58:31.730 --> 05:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
parents about this and they never did
 
05:58:35.390 --> 05:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
there was no accountability
 
05:58:36.948 --> 05:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
one of the problems with this bill is
 
05:58:39.110 --> 05:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
that proponents and opponents disagree
 
05:58:41.030 --> 05:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
on the definition of abuse
 
05:58:42.948 --> 05:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
would you consider an adult asking a
 
05:58:46.070 --> 05:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
minor to draw themselves naked abuse I
 
05:58:48.470 --> 05:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
do I would be horrified to participate
 
05:58:51.890 --> 05:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
in that activity today but at age five I
 
05:58:53.510 --> 05:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
would not even be able to decline
 
05:58:55.610 --> 05:58:55.620 align:start position:0%
participating no matter no matter how
 
05:58:57.890 --> 05:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable I was
 
05:59:00.708 --> 05:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
isn't it abuse abusive to foster a
 
05:59:02.690 --> 05:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
relationship with a minor and encourage
 
05:59:04.970 --> 05:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
them to keep secrets from their parents
 
05:59:06.830 --> 05:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
there are many examples of abusers doing
 
05:59:08.270 --> 05:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
just that
 
05:59:10.190 --> 05:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
in the same way that we should encourage
 
05:59:12.170 --> 05:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
students to not keep secrets about what
 
05:59:14.330 --> 05:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
goes on at home to prevent hiding abuse
 
05:59:16.128 --> 05:59:16.138 align:start position:0%
we should not keep secrets at school
 
05:59:19.190 --> 05:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
I'll read all this curriculum defines
 
05:59:19.200 --> 05:59:24.288 align:start position:0%
I'll read all this curriculum defines
grooming

05:59:24.288 --> 05:59:24.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:27.230 --> 05:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
there are five main categories The
 
05:59:29.390 --> 05:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
Grooming process may include building
 
05:59:32.410 --> 05:59:32.420 align:start position:0%
trust testing boundaries desensitive
 
05:59:35.150 --> 05:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
desensitization manipulation and
 
05:59:37.670 --> 05:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
confusion and I ask you does this
 
05:59:40.190 --> 05:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum do those things is it
 
05:59:40.200 --> 05:59:41.150 align:start position:0%
curriculum do those things is it
grooming

05:59:41.150 --> 05:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
grooming
 
05:59:43.430 --> 05:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
06:00:03.590 --> 06:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:05.390 --> 06:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and committee
 
06:00:06.890 --> 06:00:06.900 align:start position:0%
members it's been a long day and I
 
06:00:08.510 --> 06:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate your staying and listening to
 
06:00:11.270 --> 06:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
all of us the essential question here
 
06:00:14.390 --> 06:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
today really is should a child be the
 
06:00:17.030 --> 06:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
one who gets to decide when they're
 
06:00:18.948 --> 06:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
going to tell their parents about their
 
06:00:21.230 --> 06:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
identity if you think that should be the
 
06:00:23.448 --> 06:00:23.458 align:start position:0%
child's decision then you'd be opposed
 
06:00:25.070 --> 06:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
06:00:27.530 --> 06:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
I'll offer you two arguments that might
 
06:00:29.690 --> 06:00:29.700 align:start position:0%
just to help out first is children's
 
06:00:29.700 --> 06:00:30.830 align:start position:0%
just to help out first is children's
rights

06:00:30.830 --> 06:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
rights
 
06:00:32.990 --> 06:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
the argument was made way back earlier
 
06:00:34.310 --> 06:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
in the day I think it was speaker
 
06:00:36.850 --> 06:00:36.860 align:start position:0%
Packard who said parents should be 100
 
06:00:39.470 --> 06:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
involved in their children's life
 
06:00:41.990 --> 06:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think you can hold that to be
 
06:00:44.150 --> 06:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
true throughout a child's life when
 
06:00:46.368 --> 06:00:46.378 align:start position:0%
they're a baby yes by the time they're
 
06:00:49.788 --> 06:00:49.798 align:start position:0%
17 they have a life of their own there's
 
06:00:52.368 --> 06:00:52.378 align:start position:0%
a balance there our courts and our laws
 
06:00:54.530 --> 06:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
recognize this all of the Supreme Court
 
06:00:56.750 --> 06:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
cases that were read to you don't deny
 
06:00:59.390 --> 06:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that children have rights for
 
06:01:01.788 --> 06:01:01.798 align:start position:0%
example a minor of sound mind and
 
06:01:03.470 --> 06:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
sufficient maturity can get a
 
06:01:05.690 --> 06:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
prescription for birth control without a
 
06:01:07.850 --> 06:01:07.860 align:start position:0%
parent's permission if so deemed by the
 
06:01:10.430 --> 06:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
health care provider anyone 14 or over
 
06:01:13.788 --> 06:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
can get tested for STDs or HIV if you're
 
06:01:16.010 --> 06:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
12 you can voluntarily admit yourself
 
06:01:18.470 --> 06:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
for treatment for drug dependency that's
 
06:01:22.670 --> 06:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
RSA 318 B12 the age of consent is 16.
 
06:01:24.948 --> 06:01:24.958 align:start position:0%
there are many exceptions in New
 
06:01:26.930 --> 06:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law where children have rights
 
06:01:29.570 --> 06:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
to operate without their parents consent
 
06:01:31.548 --> 06:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court has
 
06:01:34.970 --> 06:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
repeatedly said that children become
 
06:01:37.490 --> 06:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
mature look at all the divorce cases
 
06:01:41.208 --> 06:01:41.218 align:start position:0%
from the 1980s provencel said by 14 the
 
06:01:43.670 --> 06:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
child's preference is crucial buttrick
 
06:01:46.368 --> 06:01:46.378 align:start position:0%
versus Butler chief judge king said
 
06:01:48.170 --> 06:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
Common Sense tells us that a child
 
06:01:49.910 --> 06:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
though still a minor will often be
 
06:01:51.948 --> 06:01:51.958 align:start position:0%
sufficiently mature to play a large part
 
06:01:55.070 --> 06:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
in 2005 chief judge Duggan in a case
 
06:01:56.510 --> 06:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
where one of the parents wanted to look
 
06:01:58.250 --> 06:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
at a child's mental health record said
 
06:02:00.410 --> 06:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
minors have rights which they can assert
 
06:02:02.390 --> 06:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
themselves in their own best interest
 
06:02:04.670 --> 06:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
without the involvement of their parents
 
06:02:07.490 --> 06:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
this could be today if you in other
 
06:02:08.570 --> 06:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
words the point is there are many
 
06:02:10.910 --> 06:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
examples in New Hampshire that parents
 
06:02:13.250 --> 06:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
don't have 100 control of their children
 
06:02:15.890 --> 06:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
right up until the day they turn 18. a
 
06:02:17.810 --> 06:02:17.820 align:start position:0%
better solution would be to table this
 
06:02:20.150 --> 06:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
bill and for the 20 of you to sit down
 
06:02:21.650 --> 06:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
and come up with a bill called the
 
06:02:23.750 --> 06:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
children's and parents Bill of Rights
 
06:02:25.850 --> 06:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
where you balance everything this bill
 
06:02:29.030 --> 06:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
says parents 100 percent children zero
 
06:02:31.010 --> 06:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
percent that's doesn't make sense with
 
06:02:33.230 --> 06:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
anybody's experience growing up or being
 
06:02:35.390 --> 06:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
a parent the other problem I have with
 
06:02:37.010 --> 06:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
this bill is specifically with the
 
06:02:38.868 --> 06:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
compelling straight intersection because
 
06:02:41.090 --> 06:02:41.100 align:start position:0%
those are where the exceptions exist
 
06:02:42.650 --> 06:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
you've all you've heard many people
 
06:02:44.510 --> 06:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
today say oh well if there's a problem
 
06:02:46.850 --> 06:02:46.860 align:start position:0%
at home we have this section to protect
 
06:02:50.570 --> 06:02:50.580 align:start position:0%
the kids that only works if it works
 
06:02:53.030 --> 06:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
under the RSA 169c which is the abuse
 
06:02:55.310 --> 06:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
and neglect standard that does not
 
06:02:57.650 --> 06:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
include two very common situations
 
06:03:00.470 --> 06:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
number one is homelessness and number
 
06:03:03.288 --> 06:03:03.298 align:start position:0%
two is Potential Threat of suicide if a
 
06:03:05.330 --> 06:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
school counselor knows that a child is
 
06:03:06.708 --> 06:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
either going to be homeless or might
 
06:03:09.410 --> 06:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
commit suicide David your time is up
 
06:03:12.170 --> 06:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
okay I finish that's not sufficient
 
06:03:14.030 --> 06:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
grounds for for the school to act in
 
06:03:16.310 --> 06:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
that case that section of the bill is is
 
06:03:18.350 --> 06:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
is not sufficient thank you very much
 
06:03:21.530 --> 06:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you
 
06:03:42.410 --> 06:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:44.750 --> 06:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman honorable
 
06:03:46.190 --> 06:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
06:03:48.590 --> 06:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
Kenneth Tassie Jr a resident of
 
06:03:50.810 --> 06:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire I sit on the
 
06:03:52.610 --> 06:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
board of Manchester's Board of school
 
06:03:54.590 --> 06:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
committee but I'm giving testimony
 
06:03:58.070 --> 06:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
testimony today on my own behalf
 
06:04:01.190 --> 06:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm standing here and strongly in
 
06:04:04.670 --> 06:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
support of SB 272.
 
06:04:07.610 --> 06:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
not too long ago this bill
 
06:04:09.170 --> 06:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
would have been
 
06:04:12.670 --> 06:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
Unthinkable not really even a thought
 
06:04:15.170 --> 06:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
parental rights are a really common
 
06:04:15.180 --> 06:04:17.810 align:start position:0%
parental rights are a really common
sense

06:04:17.810 --> 06:04:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:20.150 --> 06:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
this bill arises
 
06:04:22.250 --> 06:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
out of a necessity
 
06:04:24.590 --> 06:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
because there's an emergence
 
06:04:26.930 --> 06:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
of a new reality
 
06:04:26.940 --> 06:04:29.270 align:start position:0%
of a new reality
where

06:04:29.270 --> 06:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:04:33.590 --> 06:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
Up Is Down and right is left and there's
 
06:04:34.910 --> 06:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
a confusion
 
06:04:37.868 --> 06:04:37.878 align:start position:0%
I think in our in our society about
 
06:04:40.850 --> 06:04:40.860 align:start position:0%
you know what direction we need to what
 
06:04:43.368 --> 06:04:43.378 align:start position:0%
direction we need to go in
 
06:04:45.650 --> 06:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
case in point I received an email
 
06:04:45.660 --> 06:04:47.390 align:start position:0%
case in point I received an email
yesterday

06:04:47.390 --> 06:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
06:04:49.970 --> 06:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
from an advocacy group called new
 
06:04:49.980 --> 06:04:51.048 align:start position:0%
from an advocacy group called new
futures

06:04:51.048 --> 06:04:51.058 align:start position:0%
futures
 
06:04:54.530 --> 06:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
encouraging me to vote against this bill
 
06:04:57.948 --> 06:04:57.958 align:start position:0%
for the reason that quote SB 272 would
 
06:04:59.990 --> 06:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
prioritize parents rights above
 
06:05:00.000 --> 06:05:01.610 align:start position:0%
prioritize parents rights above
children's

06:05:01.610 --> 06:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
children's
 
06:05:03.288 --> 06:05:03.298 align:start position:0%
which could prevent youth from
 
06:05:05.448 --> 06:05:05.458 align:start position:0%
establishing support networks outside of
 
06:05:07.670 --> 06:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
their family and I think the
 
06:05:10.430 --> 06:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
the operating phrase here is would
 
06:05:12.770 --> 06:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
prioritize parents rights above
 
06:05:12.780 --> 06:05:14.570 align:start position:0%
prioritize parents rights above
children's

06:05:14.570 --> 06:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
children's
 
06:05:16.670 --> 06:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
in this statement
 
06:05:18.350 --> 06:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
tells me
 
06:05:21.048 --> 06:05:21.058 align:start position:0%
that the this organization and probably
 
06:05:25.128 --> 06:05:25.138 align:start position:0%
many similar to it who are with good
 
06:05:27.350 --> 06:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
intention trying to Advocate on behalf
 
06:05:29.208 --> 06:05:29.218 align:start position:0%
of of children
 
06:05:32.510 --> 06:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
believe that children have
 
06:05:34.310 --> 06:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
children's rights are Paramount
 
06:05:37.548 --> 06:05:37.558 align:start position:0%
Paramount to their their parents right
 
06:05:40.430 --> 06:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
simply by those words prioritize parents
 
06:05:45.430 --> 06:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:47.690 --> 06:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
on the contrary
 
06:05:53.628 --> 06:05:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:56.270 --> 06:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
on the contrary
 
06:05:59.330 --> 06:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
SB 272 does not put a parent's right
 
06:06:01.430 --> 06:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
above the child's right
 
06:06:03.590 --> 06:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
it puts the familial relationship
 
06:06:06.170 --> 06:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
between parents and children
 
06:06:08.690 --> 06:06:08.700 align:start position:0%
above the relationship between the
 
06:06:08.700 --> 06:06:10.310 align:start position:0%
above the relationship between the
student

06:06:10.310 --> 06:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
student
 
06:06:13.190 --> 06:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
and government employees
 
06:06:15.110 --> 06:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
so I disagree that this is a hundred
 
06:06:16.730 --> 06:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
percent for parents and zero for
 
06:06:19.310 --> 06:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
children this is a hundred percent for
 
06:06:19.320 --> 06:06:21.590 align:start position:0%
children this is a hundred percent for
family

06:06:21.590 --> 06:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
family
 
06:06:23.990 --> 06:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
and this is not to diminish the precious
 
06:06:25.970 --> 06:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
and important relationship
 
06:06:29.628 --> 06:06:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:31.430 --> 06:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
um I have a personal belief that
 
06:06:33.770 --> 06:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
teachers and nurses are are two of the
 
06:06:37.430 --> 06:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
greatest uh members of our community
 
06:06:40.670 --> 06:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
and they're all underpaid and and should
 
06:06:42.770 --> 06:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
be highly respected
 
06:06:45.650 --> 06:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to be clear this is uh
 
06:06:49.430 --> 06:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
this policy or this this bill is not
 
06:06:49.440 --> 06:06:50.810 align:start position:0%
this policy or this this bill is not
um

06:06:50.810 --> 06:06:50.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:53.690 --> 06:06:53.700 align:start position:0%
a bill that is anti
 
06:06:57.230 --> 06:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
trans or anti-lgbt your time is up thank
 
06:06:58.850 --> 06:06:58.860 align:start position:0%

06:07:06.350 --> 06:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:20.510 --> 06:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:24.230 --> 06:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:26.330 --> 06:07:26.340 align:start position:0%

06:08:01.680 --> 06:08:05.530 align:start position:0%

06:08:05.530 --> 06:08:05.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:07.788 --> 06:08:07.798 align:start position:0%
specifically on my non-binary
 
06:08:09.650 --> 06:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
transgender child
 
06:08:12.590 --> 06:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
when my kid came out to the family we
 
06:08:14.270 --> 06:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
also learned that they'd come out
 
06:08:17.448 --> 06:08:17.458 align:start position:0%
friends six months earlier teens do this
 
06:08:19.730 --> 06:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
they express things with friends and
 
06:08:22.190 --> 06:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
eventually let parents know I trust my
 
06:08:22.200 --> 06:08:23.868 align:start position:0%
eventually let parents know I trust my
kid

06:08:23.868 --> 06:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
kid
 
06:08:25.610 --> 06:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
I had a lot of questions when they came
 
06:08:27.770 --> 06:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
out I started with how much I love them
 
06:08:30.590 --> 06:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
the way just the way they are
 
06:08:33.230 --> 06:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
if my kid had been outed to me before
 
06:08:35.628 --> 06:08:35.638 align:start position:0%
they felt ready it could have done so
 
06:08:37.128 --> 06:08:37.138 align:start position:0%
much damage
 
06:08:40.490 --> 06:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
they deserve this time to think
 
06:08:43.548 --> 06:08:43.558 align:start position:0%
SB 272 also presents an attack on my
 
06:08:45.530 --> 06:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
profession as a teacher
 
06:08:48.410 --> 06:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
without a child's express permission I
 
06:08:50.690 --> 06:08:50.700 align:start position:0%
will not out that child to anyone their
 
06:08:53.150 --> 06:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
story is not mine to tell
 
06:08:55.010 --> 06:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
forcing teachers to out our children
 
06:08:58.010 --> 06:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
will send a chilling message it
 
06:09:01.310 --> 06:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
represents a gag order on children
 
06:09:03.230 --> 06:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
especially those who don't feel safe at
 
06:09:03.240 --> 06:09:05.708 align:start position:0%
especially those who don't feel safe at
home

06:09:05.708 --> 06:09:05.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:08.030 --> 06:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
lgbtq kids end up homeless at an alarm
 
06:09:10.310 --> 06:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
alarming rate you've heard a lot about
 
06:09:12.230 --> 06:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
that today
 
06:09:14.810 --> 06:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
I don't want children to end up in an
 
06:09:16.850 --> 06:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
unsafe living situation and possibly
 
06:09:19.310 --> 06:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
dropping out of school which will happen
 
06:09:21.830 --> 06:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
if this bill becomes law
 
06:09:24.470 --> 06:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
transgender youths commit suicide at a
 
06:09:25.548 --> 06:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
much higher rate than the general
 
06:09:28.970 --> 06:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
population but that rate is lower if
 
06:09:32.330 --> 06:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
they have just one just one trusted
 
06:09:34.430 --> 06:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
adult in their lives
 
06:09:36.770 --> 06:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
children need to be heard by people they
 
06:09:38.448 --> 06:09:38.458 align:start position:0%
can trust
 
06:09:40.850 --> 06:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
children will die
 
06:09:43.368 --> 06:09:43.378 align:start position:0%
if this becomes law
 
06:09:45.890 --> 06:09:45.900 align:start position:0%
my oldest kid who's now in college
 
06:09:48.530 --> 06:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
called me the other night and asked if
 
06:09:50.750 --> 06:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
we could go on a road trip together
 
06:09:52.730 --> 06:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
for a few days this summer I said I'd
 
06:09:53.868 --> 06:09:53.878 align:start position:0%
love to
 
06:09:56.270 --> 06:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
as we talked my kid let me know of a
 
06:09:59.330 --> 06:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
list of states that we can't travel to
 
06:10:01.610 --> 06:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
since they wouldn't be safe to go to the
 
06:10:05.810 --> 06:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
bathroom or feel safe to even exist
 
06:10:09.708 --> 06:10:09.718 align:start position:0%
feel safe to even exist
 
06:10:12.170 --> 06:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
please do not start down the slippery
 
06:10:13.910 --> 06:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
slope that other states have been going
 
06:10:16.850 --> 06:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
to not in New Hampshire
 
06:10:19.610 --> 06:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
I have enjoyed living here thank you
 
06:10:23.270 --> 06:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:33.110 --> 06:10:33.120 align:start position:0%

I've been in an educated for 25 years
 
06:10:50.030 --> 06:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
I've been in 25 school districts and I

was my children are 25 years old or more
 
06:11:00.110 --> 06:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
I as an educator am retired now but I
 
06:11:02.048 --> 06:11:02.058 align:start position:0%

not tell the truth to parents I'm a
 
06:11:05.940 --> 06:11:07.250 align:start position:0%

parent

06:11:07.250 --> 06:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
parent
 
06:11:09.770 --> 06:11:09.780 align:start position:0%
I did everything I could to communicate
 
06:11:13.070 --> 06:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
with parents I had newsletters I showed
 
06:11:15.470 --> 06:11:15.480 align:start position:0%

06:11:17.810 --> 06:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
school if parents wanted to communicate
 
06:11:20.150 --> 06:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
I communicated
 
06:11:24.110 --> 06:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
my hottest day that I ever taught was
 
06:11:27.708 --> 06:11:27.718 align:start position:0%
the day I had to go in after a third
 
06:11:31.250 --> 06:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
grader shot his sister by accident
 
06:11:35.330 --> 06:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
I've been through turmer but we need to
 
06:11:38.448 --> 06:11:38.458 align:start position:0%
forgive and go and move and do the best
 
06:11:40.730 --> 06:11:40.740 align:start position:0%
we can to love those children
 
06:11:43.250 --> 06:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
and to support parents

there we need we need help for some
 
06:11:52.430 --> 06:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
parents I'm not saying no but we have a
 
06:11:54.470 --> 06:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
lot of great parents that really want to
 
06:11:56.470 --> 06:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
be a part of the school
 
06:12:00.190 --> 06:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
my son because I advocated for him

he got four years of education at New
 
06:12:08.990 --> 06:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
Hampton School because the regular
 
06:12:12.350 --> 06:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
school couldn't do it and that's okay he
 
06:12:14.570 --> 06:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
just had a different learning style
 
06:12:17.030 --> 06:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
but we got a lot of great parents and a
 
06:12:20.690 --> 06:12:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:20.700 --> 06:12:22.250 align:start position:0%

welcome thank you finally
 
06:12:47.570 --> 06:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon chairman and members
 
06:12:49.548 --> 06:12:49.558 align:start position:0%
of the education committee my name is
 
06:12:52.070 --> 06:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
Michelle Clancy I'm mother I'm a Dover
 
06:12:54.170 --> 06:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
School Board member and I'm a ward chair
 
06:12:56.330 --> 06:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
for the Dover Democratic committee but
 
06:12:58.368 --> 06:12:58.378 align:start position:0%
I'm representing only myself today in
 
06:13:03.048 --> 06:13:03.058 align:start position:0%
voicing my strong opposition to SB 272
 
06:13:06.230 --> 06:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
while much of SB 272 makes sense parts
 
06:13:09.410 --> 06:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
of section 189 Overlook basic safety
 
06:13:11.570 --> 06:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
concerns and specifically Target trans
 
06:13:14.090 --> 06:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
and gender non-conforming students
 
06:13:17.510 --> 06:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
specifically in section U what is the
 
06:13:20.270 --> 06:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
definition of a reasonable person whose
 
06:13:22.490 --> 06:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
definition is that because my definition
 
06:13:24.530 --> 06:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
of a reasonable person is someone who
 
06:13:26.690 --> 06:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
accepts people for who they are allows
 
06:13:28.788 --> 06:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
people to exist as they are regardless
 
06:13:30.650 --> 06:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
of how it makes me feel
 
06:13:33.048 --> 06:13:33.058 align:start position:0%
I know without a doubt that that is not
 
06:13:34.670 --> 06:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
the Bill's definition of a reasonable
 
06:13:34.680 --> 06:13:35.930 align:start position:0%
the Bill's definition of a reasonable
person

06:13:35.930 --> 06:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
person
 
06:13:38.208 --> 06:13:38.218 align:start position:0%
this bill forces teachers counselors and
 
06:13:40.430 --> 06:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
other school officials to interfere in
 
06:13:42.470 --> 06:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
the family Dynamic instead of allowing
 
06:13:44.090 --> 06:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
young adults who know their family
 
06:13:45.890 --> 06:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
Dynamics better than any school staff
 
06:13:49.490 --> 06:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
member to decide when to or not to share
 
06:13:50.868 --> 06:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
their feelings with their parents or
 
06:13:50.878 --> 06:13:51.948 align:start position:0%
their feelings with their parents or
Guardians

06:13:51.948 --> 06:13:51.958 align:start position:0%
Guardians
 
06:13:54.350 --> 06:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
if a student is uncomfortable discussing
 
06:13:56.930 --> 06:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
a personal topic or issue with a parent
 
06:13:59.570 --> 06:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
the answer is not to use the government
 
06:14:01.850 --> 06:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
to force teachers and counselors to
 
06:14:04.070 --> 06:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
report that student to that parent
 
06:14:06.650 --> 06:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
the answer is to have mechanisms of
 
06:14:08.390 --> 06:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
support in place to enable better
 
06:14:10.548 --> 06:14:10.558 align:start position:0%
communication between the student and
 
06:14:13.430 --> 06:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
their family the answer is not to take
 
06:14:17.868 --> 06:14:17.878 align:start position:0%
away a child's choice or their privacy
 
06:14:19.850 --> 06:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to look out for the
 
06:14:22.070 --> 06:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
children who aren't comfortable sharing
 
06:14:23.510 --> 06:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
personal thoughts and feelings with
 
06:14:25.730 --> 06:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
their parents for the children who are
 
06:14:29.030 --> 06:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
afraid to be open with their parents
 
06:14:32.690 --> 06:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
please don't take away the one safe
 
06:14:35.090 --> 06:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
place that these children have please
 
06:14:37.368 --> 06:14:37.378 align:start position:0%
don't presume to understand their home
 
06:14:39.890 --> 06:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
lives better than they themselves do
 
06:14:43.128 --> 06:14:43.138 align:start position:0%
it is vital to have safe places in our
 
06:14:45.048 --> 06:14:45.058 align:start position:0%
communities where adolescents can turn
 
06:14:47.090 --> 06:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
for answers and support when they are
 
06:14:48.770 --> 06:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
too afraid or embarrassed to talk to
 
06:14:51.288 --> 06:14:51.298 align:start position:0%
their parents please don't leave these
 
06:14:53.570 --> 06:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
children unprotected and alone please
 
06:14:55.788 --> 06:14:55.798 align:start position:0%
allow public schools to continue their
 
06:14:58.610 --> 06:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
mission of educating serving and project
 
06:15:02.930 --> 06:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
protecting our youth SB 272 is a bad
 
06:15:04.970 --> 06:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
idea that will make it more difficult
 
06:15:07.670 --> 06:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
for teachers parents and students to
 
06:15:10.128 --> 06:15:10.138 align:start position:0%
trust each other and will only serve to
 
06:15:12.410 --> 06:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
further divide our already beleaguered
 
06:15:15.708 --> 06:15:15.718 align:start position:0%
communities thank you thank you Nancy
 
06:15:24.948 --> 06:15:24.958 align:start position:0%

06:15:37.730 --> 06:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Richard Anthony of
 
06:15:40.250 --> 06:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
Plaistow New Hampshire I want to speak
 
06:15:45.230 --> 06:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
in support of SB 272 in principle
 
06:15:47.930 --> 06:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
on the idea of transparency in
 
06:15:47.940 --> 06:15:48.948 align:start position:0%
on the idea of transparency in
government

06:15:48.948 --> 06:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:15:51.350 --> 06:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
and also parental rights in the sense
 
06:15:53.868 --> 06:15:53.878 align:start position:0%
that as a parent I have a vested
 
06:15:56.708 --> 06:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
interest and am the primary
 
06:16:00.048 --> 06:16:00.058 align:start position:0%
shareholder shall we say in my child's
 
06:16:02.390 --> 06:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
well-being in all considerations about
 
06:16:05.150 --> 06:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
that I understand that there are
 
06:16:07.730 --> 06:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
peripheral or even maybe concurrent
 
06:16:09.170 --> 06:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
arguments that have been brought up here
 
06:16:12.048 --> 06:16:12.058 align:start position:0%
today but
 
06:16:14.288 --> 06:16:14.298 align:start position:0%
I look at as a function of government
 
06:16:17.510 --> 06:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
that anyone that's
 
06:16:20.690 --> 06:16:20.700 align:start position:0%
basically even saying not to be truthful
 
06:16:23.810 --> 06:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
not to be forthcoming not to be
 
06:16:27.048 --> 06:16:27.058 align:start position:0%
transparent these are all words that are
 
06:16:30.170 --> 06:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
incompatible with the fact that it's a
 
06:16:33.048 --> 06:16:33.058 align:start position:0%
government it's our our money our
 
06:16:36.948 --> 06:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
children the most precious things to us
 
06:16:39.110 --> 06:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's incompatible
 
06:16:40.310 --> 06:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:16:42.708 --> 06:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
I've in my own limited way I've I've
 
06:16:45.288 --> 06:16:45.298 align:start position:0%
I've become involved in in local
 
06:16:45.298 --> 06:16:46.250 align:start position:0%
I've become involved in in local
government

06:16:46.250 --> 06:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:16:49.128 --> 06:16:49.138 align:start position:0%
on a lease on a planning level on a
 
06:16:52.910 --> 06:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
budget committee and My Credo has been
 
06:16:55.788 --> 06:16:55.798 align:start position:0%
one of transparency and advocacy for the
 
06:16:57.650 --> 06:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
people that I represent
 
06:16:59.868 --> 06:16:59.878 align:start position:0%
all right and
 
06:17:02.690 --> 06:17:02.700 align:start position:0%
what I basically see here if there's
 
06:17:05.530 --> 06:17:05.540 align:start position:0%
anyone that's saying things like
 
06:17:08.510 --> 06:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
dissembling observocating or make using
 
06:17:11.448 --> 06:17:11.458 align:start position:0%
or weaponizing the process to make it
 
06:17:13.910 --> 06:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
difficult for someone to get answers I
 
06:17:16.190 --> 06:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
find that very problematic
 
06:17:18.048 --> 06:17:18.058 align:start position:0%
I understand that there are various
 
06:17:20.570 --> 06:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
regulations rsas and such that have
 
06:17:22.430 --> 06:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
already been that are probably already
 
06:17:24.708 --> 06:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
in place and we're at the point now
 
06:17:27.530 --> 06:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
where it needs to be reiterated that
 
06:17:31.788 --> 06:17:31.798 align:start position:0%
these rsas are here and we as parents
 
06:17:34.190 --> 06:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
if we have questions if we want to be
 
06:17:35.750 --> 06:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
involved if we want to know what the
 
06:17:37.310 --> 06:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
curricula is
 
06:17:40.190 --> 06:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
we should be able to readily have access
 
06:17:43.970 --> 06:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
to it readily have it provided to us in
 
06:17:48.470 --> 06:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
a meaningful intelligible fashion
 
06:17:51.230 --> 06:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
and not have to fight for it we
 
06:17:53.690 --> 06:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to sue somebody we
 
06:17:56.570 --> 06:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to expend time money and
 
06:17:58.670 --> 06:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
effort to go through a process that's
 
06:18:01.430 --> 06:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
basically weaponized because
 
06:18:03.288 --> 06:18:03.298 align:start position:0%
most people won't pursue the process
 
06:18:05.570 --> 06:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
they will just be worn out they'll say
 
06:18:07.368 --> 06:18:07.378 align:start position:0%
that they did what they did or they'll
 
06:18:09.048 --> 06:18:09.058 align:start position:0%
accept the answer that they have and
 
06:18:10.610 --> 06:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't have the discretionary
 
06:18:12.650 --> 06:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
money to go to court all right to go
 
06:18:14.390 --> 06:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
through the three four months to turn
 
06:18:17.030 --> 06:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
around and spend some money to compel a
 
06:18:18.650 --> 06:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
bureaucrat that might have a differing
 
06:18:20.990 --> 06:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
opinion about saying this is what the
 
06:18:22.310 --> 06:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
curriculum is
 
06:18:25.250 --> 06:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
all right and it's not a hardship to say
 
06:18:27.470 --> 06:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
that providing the curriculum or you're
 
06:18:29.448 --> 06:18:29.458 align:start position:0%
going to be spending a lot of money to
 
06:18:31.430 --> 06:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
do that
 
06:18:33.410 --> 06:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
you were able to turn around say this is
 
06:18:35.330 --> 06:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
the curriculum on demand and I shouldn't
 
06:18:38.030 --> 06:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
have to sue for it
 
06:18:40.010 --> 06:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
transparency is what it's all about
 
06:18:41.570 --> 06:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:18:50.150 --> 06:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:53.628 --> 06:18:53.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you to all
 
06:18:55.730 --> 06:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
of our education committee people who
 
06:18:58.010 --> 06:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
still have ears and can still hear thank
 
06:19:00.530 --> 06:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
you thank you and thinking about the 400
 
06:19:02.390 --> 06:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
people that sat in this room this
 
06:19:04.730 --> 06:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
morning what an education that has been
 
06:19:08.150 --> 06:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
for them the folks that stayed all day I
 
06:19:11.270 --> 06:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
have served in New Hampshire schools for
 
06:19:13.970 --> 06:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
very many years I was a certified
 
06:19:18.890 --> 06:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
guidance person for a K-12 I worked in
 
06:19:21.470 --> 06:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
three different school districts I did
 
06:19:24.708 --> 06:19:24.718 align:start position:0%
run a family service organization and I
 
06:19:26.510 --> 06:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
did at one time sit in the state
 
06:19:29.690 --> 06:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
legislature I know what a tough job you
 
06:19:32.510 --> 06:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
have at this point trying to figure out
 
06:19:35.990 --> 06:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
who knows what they're talking about I
 
06:19:39.350 --> 06:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
never in all my days in school I never
 
06:19:39.360 --> 06:19:40.490 align:start position:0%
never in all my days in school I never
heard

06:19:40.490 --> 06:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
heard
 
06:19:43.670 --> 06:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
an employee of the school district say
 
06:19:45.948 --> 06:19:45.958 align:start position:0%
to a student don't tell your parents
 
06:19:49.190 --> 06:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
this I never heard that I heard kids say
 
06:19:51.350 --> 06:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
it to kids don't tell your parents this
 
06:19:55.070 --> 06:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
but I've never heard it from an employee
 
06:19:57.830 --> 06:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
of the school district I want to say too
 
06:20:00.770 --> 06:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
that as we talk about this professional
 
06:20:04.128 --> 06:20:04.138 align:start position:0%
staff have the obligation to report any
 
06:20:08.030 --> 06:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect the suspicion of abuse
 
06:20:10.850 --> 06:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
or neglect and that's where I would
 
06:20:14.150 --> 06:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
fight with your bottom line that says
 
06:20:16.368 --> 06:20:16.378 align:start position:0%
there's no expense to this bill there's
 
06:20:19.490 --> 06:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
an incredible expense to this bill if I
 
06:20:22.190 --> 06:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
hear something from a student that is
 
06:20:24.230 --> 06:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
any kind of a serious I'm going to run
 
06:20:26.208 --> 06:20:26.218 align:start position:0%
away I'm going to burn the house down
 
06:20:28.910 --> 06:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do it and I don't report
 
06:20:31.190 --> 06:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
that to Child Protection
 
06:20:33.948 --> 06:20:33.958 align:start position:0%
I'm in big trouble and if that youngster
 
06:20:37.128 --> 06:20:37.138 align:start position:0%
something happens to that youngster here
 
06:20:40.190 --> 06:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
we are facing lawsuits and lawsuits and
 
06:20:43.670 --> 06:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and malpractice insurance talk
 
06:20:46.490 --> 06:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
to the social workers Association talk
 
06:20:48.890 --> 06:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
to the guidance people how much does it
 
06:20:51.430 --> 06:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
cost for malpractice insurance because
 
06:20:54.288 --> 06:20:54.298 align:start position:0%
certainly all School employees are at
 
06:20:54.298 --> 06:20:55.730 align:start position:0%
certainly all School employees are at
risk

06:20:55.730 --> 06:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
risk
 
06:20:58.788 --> 06:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
what I heard today many things were
 
06:21:01.250 --> 06:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
talked about that just were violation of
 
06:21:05.090 --> 06:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
Ethics where is our school board where
 
06:21:07.490 --> 06:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
is our School principles Association
 
06:21:11.330 --> 06:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
where is our school administration why
 
06:21:14.330 --> 06:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
are we not talking to the people who can
 
06:21:17.208 --> 06:21:17.218 align:start position:0%
make a difference who can change things
 
06:21:20.030 --> 06:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
why are we sitting here talking about it
 
06:21:22.128 --> 06:21:22.138 align:start position:0%
in this room when we should be talking
 
06:21:23.930 --> 06:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
about it with the officials who know
 
06:21:26.750 --> 06:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
what they can do I just I'll end by just
 
06:21:26.760 --> 06:21:27.890 align:start position:0%
what they can do I just I'll end by just
saying

06:21:27.890 --> 06:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
saying
 
06:21:31.310 --> 06:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
I want you to visualize what it's like
 
06:21:35.390 --> 06:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
if you or someone you know a child does
 
06:21:38.030 --> 06:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
not know how to swim and they get pushed
 
06:21:41.690 --> 06:21:41.700 align:start position:0%
in the water and they can't get out what
 
06:21:45.110 --> 06:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
happens where is the personal flotation
 
06:21:48.230 --> 06:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
device that's going to save that adult
 
06:21:51.230 --> 06:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
or that child that personal flotation
 
06:21:55.070 --> 06:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
device for many people happens to be
 
06:21:58.090 --> 06:21:58.100 align:start position:0%
School Employees that
 
06:22:01.810 --> 06:22:01.820 align:start position:0%
the work that's done in
 
06:22:05.030 --> 06:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
parent teachers thank you and let me
 
06:22:08.090 --> 06:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
just say we can't legislate love we
 
06:22:10.548 --> 06:22:10.558 align:start position:0%
can't legislate caring but if we all did
 
06:22:12.590 --> 06:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
our part we would live in a different
 
06:22:14.690 --> 06:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
kind of world thank you
 
06:22:27.890 --> 06:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:30.410 --> 06:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
my legs are asleep I imagine yours is
 
06:22:32.868 --> 06:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
too it's been a long day I appreciate
 
06:22:35.208 --> 06:22:35.218 align:start position:0%
you all sitting here and enduring and
 
06:22:37.788 --> 06:22:37.798 align:start position:0%
listening to any uh everyone's testimony
 
06:22:40.368 --> 06:22:40.378 align:start position:0%
I learned a lot I learned that there is
 
06:22:40.378 --> 06:22:41.570 align:start position:0%
I learned a lot I learned that there is
sadness

06:22:41.570 --> 06:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
sadness
 
06:22:44.390 --> 06:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
I learned that there is Success my
 
06:22:47.750 --> 06:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
husband was a teacher for 38 years
 
06:22:47.760 --> 06:22:49.490 align:start position:0%
husband was a teacher for 38 years
grandmother

06:22:49.490 --> 06:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
grandmother
 
06:22:53.270 --> 06:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
and I homeschool my youngest grandson
 
06:22:55.548 --> 06:22:55.558 align:start position:0%
there is a great division because when
 
06:22:57.948 --> 06:22:57.958 align:start position:0%
my children went to school I was a
 
06:22:59.868 --> 06:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
parent volunteer within the school
 
06:23:04.010 --> 06:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
system I worked along teachers and I got
 
06:23:06.170 --> 06:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
to keep an eye on my kids and learn
 
06:23:08.690 --> 06:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
what's going on The Great Divide that
 
06:23:11.150 --> 06:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
was just spoken is the Divide now that
 
06:23:12.708 --> 06:23:12.718 align:start position:0%
has become
 
06:23:15.590 --> 06:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
a wedge between parents this is not a
 
06:23:18.470 --> 06:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
trans issue if indeed there are some
 
06:23:18.480 --> 06:23:19.548 align:start position:0%
trans issue if indeed there are some
trans

06:23:19.548 --> 06:23:19.558 align:start position:0%
trans
 
06:23:21.830 --> 06:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
issues within the bill maybe you guys
 
06:23:24.708 --> 06:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
can hammer it out I found out today that
 
06:23:26.990 --> 06:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
there is a law to protect these
 
06:23:29.868 --> 06:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people against abusive
 
06:23:33.470 --> 06:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
Behavior very good there's also services
 
06:23:36.070 --> 06:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
to protect
 
06:23:39.170 --> 06:23:39.180 align:start position:0%
youngsters from being abused and taken
 
06:23:40.850 --> 06:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
from households
 
06:23:43.430 --> 06:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
may not be a tremendously efficient but
 
06:23:45.170 --> 06:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
every now and then you have to treat it
 
06:23:47.448 --> 06:23:47.458 align:start position:0%
when I'm talking about
 
06:23:50.270 --> 06:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
is like my Bill of Rights my rights as a
 
06:23:53.330 --> 06:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
parent or as a grandparent that if I go
 
06:23:55.490 --> 06:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
before the schools
 
06:23:59.570 --> 06:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
and I ask that I'm told
 
06:24:02.570 --> 06:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
I'm told and I can work within that
 
06:24:02.580 --> 06:24:03.730 align:start position:0%
I'm told and I can work within that
framework

06:24:03.730 --> 06:24:03.740 align:start position:0%
framework
 
06:24:08.570 --> 06:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
not all parents are bad parents
 
06:24:12.410 --> 06:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
not all teachers are bad teachers
 
06:24:14.868 --> 06:24:14.878 align:start position:0%
work within our school board and get
 
06:24:18.110 --> 06:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
truthful answers from our school boards
 
06:24:21.470 --> 06:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
we need protection too
 
06:24:24.048 --> 06:24:24.058 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your diligence and I
 
06:24:26.868 --> 06:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I support the bill
 
06:24:29.150 --> 06:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
if it needs a little tweaking
 
06:24:32.030 --> 06:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
but I support the Bill thank you
 
06:25:00.470 --> 06:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:02.930 --> 06:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
06:25:05.810 --> 06:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
my name is James Reardon
 
06:25:09.170 --> 06:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
last time I was here was nearly 20 years
 
06:25:09.180 --> 06:25:10.368 align:start position:0%
last time I was here was nearly 20 years
ago

06:25:10.368 --> 06:25:10.378 align:start position:0%
ago
 
06:25:13.010 --> 06:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
I was invited by Senator Jack Barnes and
 
06:25:15.350 --> 06:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative Frank Bishop
 
06:25:17.690 --> 06:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
and I was presented this by the general
 
06:25:17.700 --> 06:25:18.948 align:start position:0%
and I was presented this by the general
court

06:25:18.948 --> 06:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
court
 
06:25:21.410 --> 06:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
this joint declaration for service as a
 
06:25:22.670 --> 06:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
U.S marine
 
06:25:25.788 --> 06:25:25.798 align:start position:0%
in operation enduring freedom
 
06:25:28.310 --> 06:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
never thought I'd be back
 
06:25:29.990 --> 06:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
and certainly not for something like
 
06:25:32.270 --> 06:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
this lots of people said a lot of nice
 
06:25:35.030 --> 06:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
things on both sides but
 
06:25:36.650 --> 06:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
that's all been said and I'm going to be
 
06:25:38.390 --> 06:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
more direct
 
06:25:39.890 --> 06:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
I have gone through the school system
 
06:25:43.010 --> 06:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
here personally and during a time when
 
06:25:44.690 --> 06:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
several teachers from the Raymond School
 
06:25:46.970 --> 06:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
District were sentenced to state prison
 
06:25:49.490 --> 06:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
for pedophilia
 
06:25:51.230 --> 06:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
one of which is still serving out the
 
06:25:55.430 --> 06:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:57.590 --> 06:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
are those the people that are the safe
 
06:25:57.600 --> 06:25:59.810 align:start position:0%
are those the people that are the safe
spaces

06:25:59.810 --> 06:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
spaces
 
06:26:02.150 --> 06:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
are they the lifeboats
 
06:26:04.730 --> 06:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
the kids have to have access to
 
06:26:06.230 --> 06:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
one can't help but wonder what
 
06:26:07.788 --> 06:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
punishment he would have received today
 
06:26:10.250 --> 06:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
in 2023
 
06:26:13.430 --> 06:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
makes me sad to think that
 
06:26:16.670 --> 06:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
given where we're at as a country
 
06:26:18.470 --> 06:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
some might consider him ahead of the
 
06:26:18.480 --> 06:26:20.150 align:start position:0%
some might consider him ahead of the
Curve

06:26:20.150 --> 06:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
Curve
 
06:26:22.970 --> 06:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
a presidential medal of freedom from the
 
06:26:25.070 --> 06:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
current Administration doesn't seem out
 
06:26:26.150 --> 06:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
of the question
 
06:26:30.770 --> 06:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:33.110 --> 06:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
here I have with me is a communication
 
06:26:34.730 --> 06:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
via email with the Raymond Elementary
 
06:26:37.548 --> 06:26:37.558 align:start position:0%
school nurse regarding our child in the
 
06:26:38.628 --> 06:26:38.638 align:start position:0%
first grade
 
06:26:41.090 --> 06:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
at the bottom
 
06:26:42.948 --> 06:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
she found it necessary and appropriate
 
06:26:44.930 --> 06:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
to list her pronouns on the signature
 
06:26:47.690 --> 06:26:47.700 align:start position:0%
line of her official school email
 
06:26:52.610 --> 06:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:54.708 --> 06:26:54.718 align:start position:0%
it's a dog whistle signaling she's in
 
06:26:57.410 --> 06:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
the radical gender ideology which begs
 
06:26:59.510 --> 06:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
the question
 
06:27:01.250 --> 06:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
what conversations did she have with
 
06:27:03.410 --> 06:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
six-year-old children in private
 
06:27:06.230 --> 06:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
what types of questions does she ask a
 
06:27:08.810 --> 06:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
month ago I promised I'd find out
 
06:27:11.030 --> 06:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
I made my concerns known on a local Town
 
06:27:13.548 --> 06:27:13.558 align:start position:0%
page via social media someone decided to
 
06:27:15.708 --> 06:27:15.718 align:start position:0%
report me to the police
 
06:27:17.570 --> 06:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
the police contacted me asking for
 
06:27:19.730 --> 06:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
clarification on my intentions and I was
 
06:27:22.070 --> 06:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
happy to tell them that's how I came to
 
06:27:23.868 --> 06:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
be here with you today
 
06:27:26.208 --> 06:27:26.218 align:start position:0%
I support this bill and it's unfortunate
 
06:27:28.670 --> 06:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
to say I find it necessary in today's
 
06:27:30.830 --> 06:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
sick political climate to ensure the
 
06:27:32.930 --> 06:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
protection of children against radical
 
06:27:35.628 --> 06:27:35.638 align:start position:0%
gender ideologues who are hell-bent on
 
06:27:38.090 --> 06:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
the sexualization and grooming of
 
06:27:40.070 --> 06:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
children parents should be aware of
 
06:27:41.750 --> 06:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
everything going on with their kids in
 
06:27:44.750 --> 06:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
school and be the final decider of what
 
06:27:48.410 --> 06:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
is and is not okay anyone who disagrees
 
06:27:50.810 --> 06:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
is a supporter of pedophilia and will be
 
06:27:53.390 --> 06:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
judged accordingly
 
06:27:56.030 --> 06:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
I will not rest until I'm sure that
 
06:27:57.890 --> 06:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
these degenerates are hamstringed from
 
06:27:59.628 --> 06:27:59.638 align:start position:0%
doing any further harm to our children
 
06:28:02.448 --> 06:28:02.458 align:start position:0%
and with this law they can be identified
 
06:28:04.490 --> 06:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
held accountable
 
06:28:07.070 --> 06:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
should they violate it your time is up
 
06:28:10.970 --> 06:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
thank you I support the bill and thank
 
06:28:12.530 --> 06:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
you for your time
 
06:28:15.530 --> 06:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:22.730 --> 06:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:24.948 --> 06:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony I'm
 
06:28:27.288 --> 06:28:27.298 align:start position:0%
Mary Wilke I'm a resident of Concord I'm
 
06:28:30.730 --> 06:28:30.740 align:start position:0%
a former retired public school teacher
 
06:28:33.170 --> 06:28:33.180 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to repeat what other
 
06:28:35.390 --> 06:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
people have said so
 
06:28:35.400 --> 06:28:36.170 align:start position:0%
people have said so
um

06:28:36.170 --> 06:28:36.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:38.330 --> 06:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
I oppose the bill
 
06:28:41.868 --> 06:28:41.878 align:start position:0%
um I oppose Parts TUV and W of the bill
 
06:28:43.730 --> 06:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
those are the parts I'm addressing those
 
06:28:46.368 --> 06:28:46.378 align:start position:0%
have to do with trans those are the ones
 
06:28:50.030 --> 06:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
that Target trans and lgbtq people I
 
06:28:51.288 --> 06:28:51.298 align:start position:0%
haven't really studied the other parts
 
06:28:52.610 --> 06:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
but all the other parts seem to be
 
06:28:54.708 --> 06:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
rights that that parents already already
 
06:28:54.718 --> 06:28:55.610 align:start position:0%
rights that that parents already already
have

06:28:55.610 --> 06:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:28:58.190 --> 06:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm particularly focused on those I'm
 
06:29:01.010 --> 06:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
concerned as a human being and as a
 
06:29:02.330 --> 06:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
former teacher and as a parent and
 
06:29:04.970 --> 06:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
grandparent I'm concerned about a bill
 
06:29:07.368 --> 06:29:07.378 align:start position:0%
that seems to me to be dangerous to
 
06:29:09.350 --> 06:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
young people who are very vulnerable
 
06:29:11.930 --> 06:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
already in our communities and I want to
 
06:29:13.310 --> 06:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
just mention something that hasn't
 
06:29:15.590 --> 06:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
gotten as much attention
 
06:29:15.600 --> 06:29:16.970 align:start position:0%
gotten as much attention
um

06:29:16.970 --> 06:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:19.670 --> 06:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
I just there's been a lot said about
 
06:29:21.350 --> 06:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
public school teachers here today and
 
06:29:22.730 --> 06:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
some of it's been positive a lot has
 
06:29:25.910 --> 06:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
been pretty negative I taught for many I
 
06:29:27.530 --> 06:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
taught in four different schools my kids
 
06:29:29.350 --> 06:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
went to three different Public Schools
 
06:29:32.270 --> 06:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
the teachers I knew were kind and caring
 
06:29:34.010 --> 06:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
people who had nothing but the best
 
06:29:35.390 --> 06:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
interests of their students at heart
 
06:29:37.190 --> 06:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
they were not radicalized they were not
 
06:29:39.890 --> 06:29:39.900 align:start position:0%
indoctrinating anybody they did not lie
 
06:29:42.350 --> 06:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
to parents they did not tell children to
 
06:29:44.510 --> 06:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
lie to their parents no administrator
 
06:29:46.788 --> 06:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
ever told me to lie to a parent and I
 
06:29:48.708 --> 06:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
never in a million years would have lied
 
06:29:51.230 --> 06:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
to a parent and I have to say as a
 
06:29:52.788 --> 06:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
person who dedicated a good part of my
 
06:29:54.830 --> 06:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
life to Public School teaching it's very
 
06:29:57.110 --> 06:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
painful to hear allegations like that
 
06:29:59.570 --> 06:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
and in my own experience I see nothing
 
06:30:01.730 --> 06:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
like that yes I have heard of teachers
 
06:30:03.708 --> 06:30:03.718 align:start position:0%
being arrested I've heard of hundreds of
 
06:30:06.230 --> 06:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
teachers who have who get honored by
 
06:30:09.470 --> 06:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
their students years later to say you
 
06:30:11.510 --> 06:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
made such a difference a good positive
 
06:30:14.208 --> 06:30:14.218 align:start position:0%
difference in my life I just wanna
 
06:30:15.890 --> 06:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
I just want to point that out too
 
06:30:17.208 --> 06:30:17.218 align:start position:0%
because we haven't heard a lot about
 
06:30:20.150 --> 06:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
that I just would like to say that when
 
06:30:22.070 --> 06:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
you become a teacher you go through
 
06:30:24.830 --> 06:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
training that emphasizes how important
 
06:30:27.288 --> 06:30:27.298 align:start position:0%
it is to work with parents and that the
 
06:30:28.610 --> 06:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
best success you know you'll be more
 
06:30:30.288 --> 06:30:30.298 align:start position:0%
likely to succeed with students they
 
06:30:31.730 --> 06:30:31.740 align:start position:0%
were more likely to succeed if the
 
06:30:34.010 --> 06:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
parent and teacher are teams work as
 
06:30:36.048 --> 06:30:36.058 align:start position:0%
teams and that's the teachers I worked
 
06:30:38.510 --> 06:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
with that's how they saw it
 
06:30:38.520 --> 06:30:43.430 align:start position:0%
with that's how they saw it
um

06:30:43.430 --> 06:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:45.830 --> 06:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
another thing most teachers are parents
 
06:30:48.770 --> 06:30:48.780 align:start position:0%
teachers also the ones I know believe
 
06:30:50.750 --> 06:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
that parents do have the fundamental
 
06:30:52.310 --> 06:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
right to raise their children most
 
06:30:55.250 --> 06:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
teachers I know are respectful of that
 
06:30:58.250 --> 06:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
um but parents rights are not absolute
 
06:31:01.368 --> 06:31:01.378 align:start position:0%
and children do have some rights and
 
06:31:03.470 --> 06:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
even the educator code of the ethics
 
06:31:05.990 --> 06:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
that commissioner edelblue oversaw when
 
06:31:08.570 --> 06:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
it was signed requires that Educators
 
06:31:10.970 --> 06:31:10.980 align:start position:0%
eat reach ensure that every child is
 
06:31:14.090 --> 06:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
treated with dignity and respect and if
 
06:31:17.150 --> 06:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
a child comes to a teacher and confides
 
06:31:19.810 --> 06:31:19.820 align:start position:0%
something and
 
06:31:22.910 --> 06:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
and then the teacher says have you let
 
06:31:25.010 --> 06:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
me back up if a child had come to me and
 
06:31:28.250 --> 06:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
said something in confidence about their
 
06:31:28.260 --> 06:31:29.510 align:start position:0%
said something in confidence about their
gender

06:31:29.510 --> 06:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
gender
 
06:31:31.430 --> 06:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
my first response would have been have
 
06:31:32.930 --> 06:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
you talked about this with your parents
 
06:31:35.448 --> 06:31:35.458 align:start position:0%
if they were looking for advice or help
 
06:31:38.990 --> 06:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
if they said no I haven't and if I do
 
06:31:41.390 --> 06:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'll be kicked out of the house
 
06:31:44.150 --> 06:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
I'm in a quandary that is not clear in
 
06:31:46.190 --> 06:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence that will protect me
 
06:31:49.368 --> 06:31:49.378 align:start position:0%
if I don't tell the parent which is what
 
06:31:51.230 --> 06:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
the law requires the law says oh I'd be
 
06:31:53.510 --> 06:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
fine not telling the parent if it's
 
06:31:55.010 --> 06:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence well we
 
06:31:57.170 --> 06:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
know kids sometimes exaggerate but
 
06:31:58.548 --> 06:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't we heard somebody
 
06:32:01.670 --> 06:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
today from your time is up okay thank
 
06:32:03.470 --> 06:32:03.480 align:start position:0%

06:34:08.090 --> 06:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
how's any child served
 
06:34:10.910 --> 06:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
by teaching them that their parents
 
06:34:12.890 --> 06:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
can't be trusted
 
06:34:15.650 --> 06:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
and that they don't have to tell the

06:36:38.090 --> 06:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
because it prevents students from
 
06:36:40.128 --> 06:36:40.138 align:start position:0%
establishing support networks outside of
 
06:36:41.750 --> 06:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
their families which has been shown to
 
06:36:43.368 --> 06:36:43.378 align:start position:0%
be a mitigating factor for adverse
 
06:36:46.010 --> 06:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences adverse childhood
 
06:36:48.590 --> 06:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
experiences affect approximately 61
 
06:36:50.628 --> 06:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
percent of our population
 
06:36:52.970 --> 06:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
61 percent of adults have experienced at
 
06:36:54.708 --> 06:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
least one adverse childhood experience
 
06:36:56.570 --> 06:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
in their life even if you have great
 
06:36:56.580 --> 06:36:57.708 align:start position:0%
in their life even if you have great
parents

06:36:57.708 --> 06:36:57.718 align:start position:0%
parents
 
06:37:00.470 --> 06:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
life circumstances may just
 
06:37:02.868 --> 06:37:02.878 align:start position:0%
happen to shake out that you have at an
 
06:37:04.850 --> 06:37:04.860 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood experience it can be
 
06:37:06.590 --> 06:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
something like a divorce a parent
 
06:37:09.708 --> 06:37:09.718 align:start position:0%
entering the prison system
 
06:37:11.890 --> 06:37:11.900 align:start position:0%
um severely
 
06:37:14.628 --> 06:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or just severe mental
 
06:37:17.448 --> 06:37:17.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:20.448 --> 06:37:20.458 align:start position:0%
these Aces can accumulate and lead to
 
06:37:22.850 --> 06:37:22.860 align:start position:0%
severely negative mental physical and
 
06:37:25.788 --> 06:37:25.798 align:start position:0%
behavioral health outcomes notably back
 
06:37:28.730 --> 06:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
pain can be caused by Aces so these are
 
06:37:31.490 --> 06:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
really things that are pervasive in our
 
06:37:34.250 --> 06:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
lives and get but the good news is they
 
06:37:37.128 --> 06:37:37.138 align:start position:0%
can be mitigated by having just one
 
06:37:39.470 --> 06:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
adult in our lives that we can trust and
 
06:37:42.650 --> 06:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
and talk to outside of our families
 
06:37:44.330 --> 06:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
the granite state has done an excellent
 
06:37:46.430 --> 06:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
job emphasizing this with their one
 
06:37:48.230 --> 06:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
trusted adult program
 
06:37:50.810 --> 06:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
our fear is that with this bill that one
 
06:37:53.510 --> 06:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
trusted adult program will be unable to
 
06:37:55.368 --> 06:37:55.378 align:start position:0%
continue and that children will be
 
06:37:56.868 --> 06:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
discouraged from forming these
 
06:37:58.430 --> 06:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
relationships that can help mitigate
 
06:38:00.530 --> 06:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
these problematic events in their
 
06:38:00.540 --> 06:38:02.948 align:start position:0%
these problematic events in their
childhood

06:38:02.948 --> 06:38:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:07.070 --> 06:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
as such we would strongly urge this
 
06:38:10.930 --> 06:38:10.940 align:start position:0%
committee to vote Senate Bill 272
 
06:38:14.090 --> 06:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
itl and you should have all my testimony
 
06:38:18.410 --> 06:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:21.650 --> 06:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
uh next speaker would be Rebecca

hi my name is Jen and I'm speaking on

behalf of Rebecca non Rebecca Rose

uh their testimony
 
06:38:50.570 --> 06:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
I'm a global racial and social
 
06:38:52.910 --> 06:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
inequality lab research intern a UNH
 
06:38:55.368 --> 06:38:55.378 align:start position:0%
student studying sociology and a parent
 
06:38:57.590 --> 06:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
I've held membership in numerous lgbtq
 
06:39:00.110 --> 06:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
clubs and support groups both on and off
 
06:39:02.868 --> 06:39:02.878 align:start position:0%
school campuses and as both a minor and
 
06:39:04.850 --> 06:39:04.860 align:start position:0%
an adult in these groups there is an
 
06:39:05.990 --> 06:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
essential agreement that all
 
06:39:08.150 --> 06:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
participants make to preserve
 
06:39:10.310 --> 06:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
confidentiality this is because most
 
06:39:12.830 --> 06:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus people understand that safety
 
06:39:14.510 --> 06:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
is one of the most important issues for
 
06:39:16.250 --> 06:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
a community during a Time
 
06:39:18.788 --> 06:39:18.798 align:start position:0%
of Nationwide anti-lgbtq plus
 
06:39:21.110 --> 06:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
legislative efforts and epidemic
 
06:39:22.930 --> 06:39:22.940 align:start position:0%
epidemic levels of
 
06:39:26.390 --> 06:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
anti-lgbtq hate crimes
 
06:39:28.190 --> 06:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
when I was in eighth grade at runlett
 
06:39:29.810 --> 06:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
middle school I gave to my school
 
06:39:32.330 --> 06:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
counselor a t-shirt covered in blood my
 
06:39:34.070 --> 06:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
blood and an undeveloped role film
 
06:39:35.990 --> 06:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
containing photos of my beat up face and
 
06:39:37.270 --> 06:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
asked for help
 
06:39:39.650 --> 06:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
dcyf was contacted and soon I was
 
06:39:41.330 --> 06:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
interviewed by a social worker at my
 
06:39:43.610 --> 06:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
school I told her every detail about the
 
06:39:45.410 --> 06:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
abuse I faced at home later that weekend
 
06:39:47.570 --> 06:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
she came to my home and interviewed me
 
06:39:50.090 --> 06:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
again in front of my abuser my mother
 
06:39:51.948 --> 06:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
I was terrified of what would happen to
 
06:39:53.570 --> 06:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
me so when she asked me the same
 
06:39:55.128 --> 06:39:55.138 align:start position:0%
questions this time with my abuser
 
06:39:56.930 --> 06:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
staring into my eyes I panicked and I
 
06:39:59.030 --> 06:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
lied the case was dropped and the abuse
 
06:39:59.040 --> 06:40:00.230 align:start position:0%
lied the case was dropped and the abuse
continued

06:40:00.230 --> 06:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
continued
 
06:40:02.030 --> 06:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
the following summer I was arrested for
 
06:40:03.948 --> 06:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
defending myself against my abuser I was
 
06:40:05.750 --> 06:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
put on probation and bounced around
 
06:40:07.730 --> 06:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
group homes for years when I told my
 
06:40:09.708 --> 06:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
probation officer I was being abused she
 
06:40:11.030 --> 06:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
said nothing and changed the subject
 
06:40:13.128 --> 06:40:13.138 align:start position:0%
when my court ordered psychologists
 
06:40:14.868 --> 06:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
reported that she suspected I was being
 
06:40:16.368 --> 06:40:16.378 align:start position:0%
abused my mother simply changed the
 
06:40:17.810 --> 06:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
mental health provider and nothing came
 
06:40:20.390 --> 06:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
up the reports child abuse is a serious
 
06:40:21.770 --> 06:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
social problem that multiplies
 
06:40:24.890 --> 06:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
exponentially for lgbtq children the
 
06:40:26.390 --> 06:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
systems put in place to protect children
 
06:40:28.548 --> 06:40:28.558 align:start position:0%
from abuse at home are inadequate and
 
06:40:31.610 --> 06:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
deeply flawed SB 272 does not protect
 
06:40:33.770 --> 06:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
lgbtq children but increases the
 
06:40:35.570 --> 06:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
likelihood that they would be abused at
 
06:40:38.628 --> 06:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
home this bill opens up lgbtq children
 
06:40:41.330 --> 06:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
to unnecessary trauma I'm speaking to
 
06:40:43.670 --> 06:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
you not only as an lgbtq Survivor of
 
06:40:45.770 --> 06:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
child abuse inflected by a parent but as
 
06:40:47.470 --> 06:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
the mother of a New Hampshire student
 
06:40:49.850 --> 06:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
lgbtq students who choose not to come
 
06:40:51.288 --> 06:40:51.298 align:start position:0%
out to their parents do so for many
 
06:40:53.750 --> 06:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
reasons and all too often that reason is
 
06:40:55.368 --> 06:40:55.378 align:start position:0%
related to fear for their own emotional
 
06:40:57.590 --> 06:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
and physical safety I implore you please
 
06:41:02.628 --> 06:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:14.628 --> 06:41:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:19.250 --> 06:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
hello I'm Lee and I oppose this bill as
 
06:41:23.448 --> 06:41:23.458 align:start position:0%
a trans man who uh transitioned in New
 
06:41:23.458 --> 06:41:24.190 align:start position:0%
a trans man who uh transitioned in New
Hampshire

06:41:24.190 --> 06:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:41:28.670 --> 06:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
and I was fortunate to have a relatively
 
06:41:30.770 --> 06:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
positive experience and a lot of that
 
06:41:34.490 --> 06:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
was due to coming out on my own terms
 
06:41:37.190 --> 06:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
like six or so years after the fact
 
06:41:39.350 --> 06:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
after I started socially transitioning
 
06:41:39.360 --> 06:41:41.708 align:start position:0%
after I started socially transitioning
and

06:41:41.708 --> 06:41:41.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:41:45.310 --> 06:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
the wording of this bill
 
06:41:47.690 --> 06:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
directly targets
 
06:41:51.170 --> 06:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
kids invulnerable situations trans kids
 
06:41:54.110 --> 06:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
kids who may I don't know cut their hair
 
06:41:57.590 --> 06:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
short and suddenly their teacher is
 
06:42:00.170 --> 06:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
having to report on all of these little
 
06:42:02.448 --> 06:42:02.458 align:start position:0%
details that it's frankly none of their
 
06:42:04.430 --> 06:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
business it's
 
06:42:06.410 --> 06:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
that's not a great example I'll admit
 
06:42:07.850 --> 06:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
that I have no notes because I wasn't
 
06:42:10.070 --> 06:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
expecting to be here this is supposed to
 
06:42:12.548 --> 06:42:12.558 align:start position:0%
be a bill about parental rights
 
06:42:15.708 --> 06:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
bolstering support systems within the
 
06:42:17.868 --> 06:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
school and that's not what this is
 
06:42:22.610 --> 06:42:22.620 align:start position:0%
there's no compensation for outing these
 
06:42:26.330 --> 06:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children already at risk
 
06:42:28.730 --> 06:42:28.740 align:start position:0%
there's there's nothing to compensate
 
06:42:29.810 --> 06:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
for that
 
06:42:33.890 --> 06:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
and we've seen today supporters of this
 
06:42:38.410 --> 06:42:38.420 align:start position:0%
bill are relying on just like unfounded
 
06:42:43.330 --> 06:42:43.340 align:start position:0%
graphic claims stories which
 
06:42:47.628 --> 06:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
multiple are true in some cases it
 
06:42:50.330 --> 06:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter because
 
06:42:52.548 --> 06:42:52.558 align:start position:0%
they're relying on
 
06:42:55.368 --> 06:42:55.378 align:start position:0%
accusing people of being groomers and
 
06:42:59.510 --> 06:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
pedophiles and being cult members things
 
06:43:03.048 --> 06:43:03.058 align:start position:0%
like that and it's just unnecessary
 
06:43:03.058 --> 06:43:04.430 align:start position:0%
like that and it's just unnecessary
when

06:43:04.430 --> 06:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
when
 
06:43:08.030 --> 06:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
this should just be a matter of
 
06:43:11.510 --> 06:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
again bolstering a student's support
 
06:43:13.910 --> 06:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
systems and
 
06:43:16.490 --> 06:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
this is kind of the Line in the Sand
 
06:43:18.708 --> 06:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
where you have to decide
 
06:43:22.430 --> 06:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
whether you are going to support a
 
06:43:25.750 --> 06:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
person's right to defend the right for
 
06:43:28.730 --> 06:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
self-determination defend the right to
 
06:43:33.048 --> 06:43:33.058 align:start position:0%
for self-expression and this bill would
 
06:43:36.350 --> 06:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
interfere with that and again could put
 
06:43:40.730 --> 06:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
a lot of kids in danger so I would
 
06:43:43.128 --> 06:43:43.138 align:start position:0%
just highlight
 
06:43:46.788 --> 06:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
that from my perspective as a citizen of
 
06:43:50.390 --> 06:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire being accused of of all
 
06:43:53.690 --> 06:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
these things when I just want

06:44:26.090 --> 06:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
party here uh pretty much everything I

wanted to say has been said by someone
 
06:44:30.110 --> 06:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
probably much more articulate than
 
06:44:32.750 --> 06:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
myself so shout outs to them uh thank
 
06:44:34.368 --> 06:44:34.378 align:start position:0%
you for everyone who shared a personal
 
06:44:38.830 --> 06:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
story uh people here were very brave to
 
06:44:41.330 --> 06:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
express themselves I know it's very
 
06:44:43.250 --> 06:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
difficult to come up here and tell a
 
06:44:45.350 --> 06:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
very personal story about yourself
 
06:44:48.170 --> 06:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
uh well one of the things I just want to
 
06:44:48.180 --> 06:44:49.070 align:start position:0%
uh well one of the things I just want to
uh

06:44:49.070 --> 06:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:44:52.070 --> 06:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh say is that teachers are a very
 
06:44:55.190 --> 06:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
valuable function to society you know
 
06:44:59.690 --> 06:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
like uh it can generally like go into
 
06:45:01.610 --> 06:45:01.620 align:start position:0%
the realm of like public health you know
 
06:45:03.708 --> 06:45:03.718 align:start position:0%
I I never lived through it but I know I
 
06:45:05.390 --> 06:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
can see a lot of people here would have
 
06:45:07.250 --> 06:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
lived through like the age pandemic in
 
06:45:09.830 --> 06:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
the 80s and the 90s and that's an issue
 
06:45:12.708 --> 06:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
that could have been solved like tens of
 
06:45:14.510 --> 06:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
thousands of people didn't need to die
 
06:45:17.868 --> 06:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
just for like teachers being able to say
 
06:45:19.970 --> 06:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
like hey you gotta you gotta wrap it up
 
06:45:22.250 --> 06:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
bud like you got to do something about
 
06:45:22.260 --> 06:45:23.930 align:start position:0%
bud like you got to do something about
that

06:45:23.930 --> 06:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:45:23.940 --> 06:45:24.708 align:start position:0%
that
um

06:45:24.708 --> 06:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:28.368 --> 06:45:28.378 align:start position:0%
and uh like I think that we the the
 
06:45:31.250 --> 06:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
constant undermining of teachers and the
 
06:45:33.530 --> 06:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
culture and just the fact that like I
 
06:45:35.930 --> 06:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
know so many teachers is personally I'll
 
06:45:37.788 --> 06:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
see them just like they work you know
 
06:45:39.110 --> 06:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
the high school and then I see them
 
06:45:42.230 --> 06:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
waiting tables it's like what the hell's
 
06:45:43.670 --> 06:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
with that like shouldn't they be
 
06:45:45.530 --> 06:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
shouldn't they not need another job
 
06:45:47.510 --> 06:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
speaking mostly to you guys right here
 
06:45:49.368 --> 06:45:49.378 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe that's something you can
 
06:45:51.650 --> 06:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
look into but uh
 
06:45:53.510 --> 06:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
yeah no I think it's kind of just
 
06:45:56.150 --> 06:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
disgusting and I think that for the few
 
06:45:58.850 --> 06:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
of you who are still uh in support of
 
06:46:00.708 --> 06:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
this bill you have people in your life
 
06:46:03.350 --> 06:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
that you can talk to and be like hey uh
 
06:46:05.150 --> 06:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
you probably had someone in your life
 
06:46:06.830 --> 06:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
who wasn't completely cool with you
 
06:46:08.810 --> 06:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
how'd that go for you how did that feel
 
06:46:11.570 --> 06:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
to talk to someone like that like to
 
06:46:13.368 --> 06:46:13.378 align:start position:0%
have someone that you care about someone
 
06:46:15.770 --> 06:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
you love who not a completely okay with
 
06:46:17.930 --> 06:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
that how would it feel to that person
 
06:46:20.208 --> 06:46:20.218 align:start position:0%
before they were okay to meet you on
 
06:46:23.448 --> 06:46:23.458 align:start position:0%
your own terms just was told was by a
 
06:46:27.170 --> 06:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
teacher like that suck and that's all I
 
06:46:29.150 --> 06:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
have to say thank you
 
06:46:31.910 --> 06:46:31.920 align:start position:0%

testify in opposition to SB 272.
 
06:47:18.048 --> 06:47:18.058 align:start position:0%
in addition to the many threats to
 
06:47:19.610 --> 06:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
student safety and privacy that you have
 
06:47:20.868 --> 06:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
heard from others opposing this bill
 
06:47:20.878 --> 06:47:21.650 align:start position:0%
heard from others opposing this bill
today

06:47:21.650 --> 06:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:47:23.330 --> 06:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
I want you to also think about kids like
 
06:47:23.340 --> 06:47:24.230 align:start position:0%
I want you to also think about kids like
me

06:47:24.230 --> 06:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
me
 
06:47:25.490 --> 06:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
I've been in the New Hampshire School
 
06:47:27.650 --> 06:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
System since I started Pre-K and once I
 
06:47:29.448 --> 06:47:29.458 align:start position:0%
got to elementary school I remember one
 
06:47:31.368 --> 06:47:31.378 align:start position:0%
of my parents asked me
 
06:47:33.170 --> 06:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
why I didn't like to dress pretty like
 
06:47:34.850 --> 06:47:34.860 align:start position:0%
the other girls
 
06:47:36.890 --> 06:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
why did I wear running sneakers instead
 
06:47:38.510 --> 06:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
of the cute pink sandals like all my
 
06:47:41.208 --> 06:47:41.218 align:start position:0%
friends why did I choose short instead
 
06:47:45.170 --> 06:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
of flower printed dresses and skirts
 
06:47:47.690 --> 06:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
you know what my answer was
 
06:47:49.968 --> 06:47:49.978 align:start position:0%
I like to play at recess
 
06:47:52.430 --> 06:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
I don't like the wood chips in my shoes
 
06:47:55.310 --> 06:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I don't like when my skirt flies up
 
06:47:58.968 --> 06:47:58.978 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:00.948 --> 06:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
this was a pretty common occurrence for
 
06:48:03.288 --> 06:48:03.298 align:start position:0%
me through elementary middle and high
 
06:48:06.708 --> 06:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
school yes even after recess ended
 
06:48:10.070 --> 06:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
I still preferred my sneakers and shorts
 
06:48:12.350 --> 06:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
I wrestled with that for many many years
 
06:48:16.190 --> 06:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
I asked myself why don't I want to have
 
06:48:19.490 --> 06:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
cute outfits like my friends why why
 
06:48:21.650 --> 06:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
don't I have the same interest as them
 
06:48:23.810 --> 06:48:23.820 align:start position:0%
am I non-binary
 
06:48:28.670 --> 06:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:30.590 --> 06:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
I push myself to wear clothes I didn't
 
06:48:32.510 --> 06:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable in so the questions
 
06:48:33.770 --> 06:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
would stop
 
06:48:35.448 --> 06:48:35.458 align:start position:0%
traded my running shoes in for ballet
 
06:48:37.128 --> 06:48:37.138 align:start position:0%
flats in my shorts and pants in for
 
06:48:37.138 --> 06:48:38.090 align:start position:0%
flats in my shorts and pants in for
dresses

06:48:38.090 --> 06:48:38.100 align:start position:0%
dresses
 
06:48:39.650 --> 06:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
I stared in the mirror every morning
 
06:48:42.590 --> 06:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
forced myself to smile knew that I would
 
06:48:44.690 --> 06:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
be told that I looked pretty today
 
06:48:47.150 --> 06:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
and I fit in with my friends a little
 
06:48:48.708 --> 06:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
bit better
 
06:48:52.490 --> 06:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:54.230 --> 06:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
I expressed myself a little bit
 
06:48:55.670 --> 06:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
differently than the traditional
 
06:48:59.628 --> 06:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
feminine standards but I've always been
 
06:49:02.150 --> 06:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
what everyone is so worried about the
 
06:49:03.830 --> 06:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
straight kids I've always been the
 
06:49:05.868 --> 06:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
straight kid
 
06:49:07.788 --> 06:49:07.798 align:start position:0%
I've always known that that's always
 
06:49:09.770 --> 06:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
been in me so
 
06:49:12.048 --> 06:49:12.058 align:start position:0%
what makes it any different for lgbtq
 
06:49:13.368 --> 06:49:13.378 align:start position:0%
plus peers
 
06:49:18.350 --> 06:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:20.330 --> 06:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
the only reason I ever began to question
 
06:49:22.910 --> 06:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
myself was because the people that I
 
06:49:26.090 --> 06:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
trusted began pushing their perception
 
06:49:29.690 --> 06:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
of what was considered right onto me and
 
06:49:32.150 --> 06:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
my personal preferences
 
06:49:35.090 --> 06:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
so my question for you is
 
06:49:38.208 --> 06:49:38.218 align:start position:0%
would you perceive me dressing in
 
06:49:40.010 --> 06:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
athletic shorts and running shoes at
 
06:49:42.530 --> 06:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
eight years old as being gay versus the
 
06:49:44.330 --> 06:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
rest of my peers
 
06:49:46.670 --> 06:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
would your perception of me mean my
 
06:49:48.830 --> 06:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
parents needed a phone call to let them
 
06:49:51.530 --> 06:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
know that I might be trans because this
 
06:49:51.540 --> 06:49:52.430 align:start position:0%
know that I might be trans because this
bill

06:49:52.430 --> 06:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:49:55.368 --> 06:49:55.378 align:start position:0%
does include teachers reporting students
 
06:49:58.610 --> 06:49:58.620 align:start position:0%
that they perceive to be trans
 
06:49:58.620 --> 06:50:02.330 align:start position:0%
that they perceive to be trans
perception

06:50:02.330 --> 06:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:05.570 --> 06:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
this bill SB 272 cannot be implemented
 
06:50:07.310 --> 06:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
without discrimination
 
06:50:09.770 --> 06:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
there is no way around that you would
 
06:50:11.150 --> 06:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
not be treating every student in that
 
06:50:14.750 --> 06:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
school the same that is discrimination
 
06:50:17.030 --> 06:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
there is a very clear line there and the
 
06:50:18.288 --> 06:50:18.298 align:start position:0%
youth in New Hampshire deserve a
 
06:50:20.390 --> 06:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
legislature that protects their rights
 
06:50:23.208 --> 06:50:23.218 align:start position:0%
not infringes on them
 
06:50:26.448 --> 06:50:26.458 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote itl on SB 272
 
06:50:29.208 --> 06:50:29.218 align:start position:0%

hi my name is Alex Frazier and I'm a
 
06:50:40.030 --> 06:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
student at mvms
 
06:50:42.708 --> 06:50:42.718 align:start position:0%

an aunt
 
06:50:48.830 --> 06:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
when I was hearing this when I decided
 
06:50:50.628 --> 06:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
to come to this hearing I did not plan
 
06:50:53.030 --> 06:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
to speak but after sitting here for
 
06:50:55.010 --> 06:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
hours listening to everybody's testimony
 
06:50:57.890 --> 06:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
I finally decided that I would put my
 
06:50:59.990 --> 06:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
opinion in on this matter my age group
 
06:51:02.570 --> 06:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
and those older than me and younger than
 
06:51:04.788 --> 06:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
me are being affected by this one thing
 
06:51:07.310 --> 06:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
I'd like to emphasize is honesty honesty
 
06:51:08.990 --> 06:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
is something that simply can't be argued
 
06:51:10.788 --> 06:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
I'm sure everyone here can agree that
 
06:51:12.650 --> 06:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
honesty is very important this bill
 
06:51:14.510 --> 06:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
promotes honesty between the public
 
06:51:16.968 --> 06:51:16.978 align:start position:0%
education system and parents as well as
 
06:51:20.830 --> 06:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
honesty between parents and children
 
06:51:23.330 --> 06:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
this this has been turned into a battle
 
06:51:26.390 --> 06:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
between oppression and the lgbtq plus
 
06:51:28.368 --> 06:51:28.378 align:start position:0%
Community but that is not what this
 
06:51:30.288 --> 06:51:30.298 align:start position:0%
should be about this is about the safety
 
06:51:31.850 --> 06:51:31.860 align:start position:0%
of children in public schools and
 
06:51:34.010 --> 06:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
parents knowing what they need to know
 
06:51:36.948 --> 06:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
about kids children's children like me
 
06:51:39.468 --> 06:51:39.478 align:start position:0%
are vulnerable as well as our minds are
 
06:51:40.968 --> 06:51:40.978 align:start position:0%
developing and are at a mental health
 
06:51:43.730 --> 06:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
risk on this topic every child wants to
 
06:51:46.490 --> 06:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
fit in with others or be cool with all
 
06:51:48.850 --> 06:51:48.860 align:start position:0%
respect to all lgbtq
 
06:51:51.948 --> 06:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus community members most kids
 
06:51:53.990 --> 06:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
transition to be cool or popular
 
06:51:56.810 --> 06:51:56.820 align:start position:0%
teachers don't always do teachers don't
 
06:51:58.968 --> 06:51:58.978 align:start position:0%
always understand this and socially
 
06:52:00.830 --> 06:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
transition children confusing children
 
06:52:03.170 --> 06:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
more more than 45 percent of the
 
06:52:05.510 --> 06:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
transgender people commit commit suicide
 
06:52:07.128 --> 06:52:07.138 align:start position:0%
after being affirmed in their new
 
06:52:10.250 --> 06:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
identity most kids go through or this
 
06:52:12.410 --> 06:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
around my age when we are all
 
06:52:14.208 --> 06:52:14.218 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with the changes in our
 
06:52:16.368 --> 06:52:16.378 align:start position:0%
bodies children think this is a way to
 
06:52:18.170 --> 06:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
fix that uncomfortable feeling in
 
06:52:20.270 --> 06:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
addition there is a school counselor who
 
06:52:22.430 --> 06:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
anyone can go to and say hey I smoked
 
06:52:23.868 --> 06:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
pot this weekend with my best friend
 
06:52:25.910 --> 06:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
over in the fields across the school and
 
06:52:27.590 --> 06:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
she is not allowed to tell the parents
 
06:52:27.600 --> 06:52:28.368 align:start position:0%
she is not allowed to tell the parents
this

06:52:28.368 --> 06:52:28.378 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:52:30.650 --> 06:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
right now is the most crucial time for
 
06:52:32.208 --> 06:52:32.218 align:start position:0%
honesty and not having secrets between
 
06:52:34.010 --> 06:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
kids and parents and having the people
 
06:52:36.530 --> 06:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
teaching your children lying to you the
 
06:52:38.628 --> 06:52:38.638 align:start position:0%
one raising that child isn't a good way
 
06:52:42.230 --> 06:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:44.570 --> 06:52:44.580 align:start position:0%
and for the record I'm okay with having
 
06:52:47.270 --> 06:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
the lower percent of control as a minor
 
06:52:49.788 --> 06:52:49.798 align:start position:0%
child still developing please vote Yes
 
06:52:51.350 --> 06:52:51.360 align:start position:0%

good afternoon and thank you for your
 
06:53:44.150 --> 06:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
patience I'm Stephen scare from Nashua
 
06:53:46.128 --> 06:53:46.138 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'm here to urge you
 
06:53:48.410 --> 06:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
to support this bill we've heard a lot
 
06:53:50.448 --> 06:53:50.458 align:start position:0%
about transgender children but I have no
 
06:53:52.968 --> 06:53:52.978 align:start position:0%
idea what one is is it someone whose sex
 
06:53:56.090 --> 06:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
was misassigned at Birth someone who
 
06:53:58.670 --> 06:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
somehow was born in the wrong body and
 
06:54:00.770 --> 06:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
has a gendered soul or a gendered
 
06:54:00.780 --> 06:54:01.850 align:start position:0%
has a gendered soul or a gendered
identity

06:54:01.850 --> 06:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
identity
 
06:54:03.350 --> 06:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
or is it someone who's just
 
06:54:03.360 --> 06:54:06.070 align:start position:0%
or is it someone who's just
non-conforming

06:54:06.070 --> 06:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
non-conforming
 
06:54:09.230 --> 06:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
traditionally and why it's in the DSM is
 
06:54:11.750 --> 06:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
that it's a mental health disorder that
 
06:54:13.250 --> 06:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
we need to treat
 
06:54:16.250 --> 06:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
most people I talk to assume that when
 
06:54:18.010 --> 06:54:18.020 align:start position:0%
Physicians and therapists treat
 
06:54:20.690 --> 06:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
childhood gender dysphoria they go
 
06:54:22.730 --> 06:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
through a really regimented process for
 
06:54:24.948 --> 06:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
years evidence-based treatment and work
 
06:54:26.510 --> 06:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
with the family
 
06:54:28.788 --> 06:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
but our school policies show us
 
06:54:31.430 --> 06:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise that a school can be socially
 
06:54:34.330 --> 06:54:34.340 align:start position:0%
transitioned before receiving any
 
06:54:37.430 --> 06:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy for underlying issues and
 
06:54:39.530 --> 06:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
that makes a diagnosis of gender
 
06:54:41.750 --> 06:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
dysphoria inevitable and that's why
 
06:54:43.190 --> 06:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
parents need this law and that's why
 
06:54:45.410 --> 06:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
they need your help in New Hampshire a
 
06:54:48.410 --> 06:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
14 year old girl with autism and PTSD
 
06:54:50.930 --> 06:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
can identify as a boy the school
 
06:54:53.628 --> 06:54:53.638 align:start position:0%
facilitate her social transition with
 
06:54:56.030 --> 06:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
clothes and pronouns and hide her new
 
06:54:58.548 --> 06:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
identity from her parents when she's 18
 
06:55:01.250 --> 06:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
she can get testosterone on her first
 
06:55:03.468 --> 06:55:03.478 align:start position:0%
trip to the clinic without ever having
 
06:55:06.830 --> 06:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
had a psychological evaluation
 
06:55:09.230 --> 06:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's gender affirmation model
 
06:55:11.868 --> 06:55:11.878 align:start position:0%
has been abandoned by England Norway
 
06:55:14.170 --> 06:55:14.180 align:start position:0%
Finland and Sweden as dangerous and
 
06:55:18.230 --> 06:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
ineffective gender affirmation lets kids
 
06:55:20.150 --> 06:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
diagnose themselves and choose the
 
06:55:22.730 --> 06:55:22.740 align:start position:0%
course of treatments any coexisting
 
06:55:25.250 --> 06:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
mental health problems that might be at
 
06:55:27.410 --> 06:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
the root of the gender dysphoria are
 
06:55:29.690 --> 06:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
dismissed as being part of the minority
 
06:55:32.448 --> 06:55:32.458 align:start position:0%
stress of gender dysphoria that's
 
06:55:34.510 --> 06:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
concerning because
 
06:55:37.910 --> 06:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
over 97 percent of trans identifying
 
06:55:40.310 --> 06:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
youth are diagnosed with real leader
 
06:55:43.310 --> 06:55:43.320 align:start position:0%

06:55:46.490 --> 06:55:46.500 align:start position:0%

England's largest gender Clinic
 
06:55:51.530 --> 06:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
social transitioning isn't a neutral
 
06:55:53.868 --> 06:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
intervention because it pushes kids
 
06:55:56.750 --> 06:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
towards irreversible medical transitions
 
06:55:59.030 --> 06:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
that can result in cardiovascular

they need and allow them to go through
 
06:56:14.628 --> 06:56:14.638 align:start position:0%

Levine's young daughter began to

identify as male the school not only
 
06:58:05.690 --> 06:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
concealed this from Amber but gave the
 
06:58:08.448 --> 06:58:08.458 align:start position:0%
daughter who had just turned 13 a chest
 
06:58:10.670 --> 06:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
binder when the mother found out about
 
06:58:12.410 --> 06:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
this and withdrew her daughter from the
 
06:58:14.330 --> 06:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
school she was immediately reported to
 
06:58:16.788 --> 06:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
and investigated by Maine's equivalent
 
06:58:20.690 --> 06:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
of dcyf for alleged low severity

government secretly giving her daughter

a chest binder this is important to us
 
06:58:32.510 --> 06:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
because the policy that this main School
 
06:58:34.850 --> 06:58:34.860 align:start position:0%
District used to do this to Amber
 
06:58:37.368 --> 06:58:37.378 align:start position:0%
Levine's daughter is based on a Model
 
06:58:39.110 --> 06:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
created by a national organization
 
06:58:41.810 --> 06:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
called glsen that's gay lesbian and
 
06:58:44.868 --> 06:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
straight Educators Network and that same
 
06:58:47.868 --> 06:58:47.878 align:start position:0%
model is also the template for the
 
06:58:51.708 --> 06:58:51.718 align:start position:0%
so-called policy jbab jbab that's been
 
06:58:54.048 --> 06:58:54.058 align:start position:0%
enacted by dozens of school districts
 
06:58:55.968 --> 06:58:55.978 align:start position:0%
all over New Hampshire now as you heard
 
06:58:58.628 --> 06:58:58.638 align:start position:0%
quoted in Senator Carson's testimony
 
06:59:01.190 --> 06:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
these policies in New Hampshire will
 
06:59:03.350 --> 06:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
typically just come right out and say
 
06:59:05.930 --> 06:59:05.940 align:start position:0%
explicitly that a school should not only
 
06:59:08.030 --> 06:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
conceal social transitioning from
 
06:59:11.030 --> 06:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
parents but should affirmatively lie to
 
06:59:12.890 --> 06:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
parents to prevent them from finding out
 
06:59:14.750 --> 06:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
about this and these school districts
 
06:59:17.448 --> 06:59:17.458 align:start position:0%
will also lie to parents by falsely
 
06:59:19.430 --> 06:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
claiming that these policies are somehow
 
06:59:21.610 --> 06:59:21.620 align:start position:0%
required by state or federal
 
06:59:23.690 --> 06:59:23.700 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination law even though
 
06:59:25.430 --> 06:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
there's been no cases holding this
 
06:59:25.440 --> 06:59:26.868 align:start position:0%
there's been no cases holding this
anywhere

06:59:26.868 --> 06:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
06:59:28.968 --> 06:59:28.978 align:start position:0%
of course the drum beat that you'll
 
06:59:32.090 --> 06:59:32.100 align:start position:0%
usually hear against this bill is that
 
06:59:34.190 --> 06:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
if parents are allowed to learn that
 
06:59:35.628 --> 06:59:35.638 align:start position:0%
their child is transgender then they
 
06:59:37.368 --> 06:59:37.378 align:start position:0%
will abuse their children
 
06:59:40.368 --> 06:59:40.378 align:start position:0%
but in every other context parents are
 
06:59:42.948 --> 06:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
presumed innocent and retained their
 
06:59:45.288 --> 06:59:45.298 align:start position:0%
parental rights unless there's at least
 
06:59:48.048 --> 06:59:48.058 align:start position:0%
some small Quantum of evidence of
 
06:59:50.868 --> 06:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
specific wrongdoing it's only in this
 
06:59:53.330 --> 06:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
context that we presumptively declare
 
06:59:55.548 --> 06:59:55.558 align:start position:0%
all parents guilty take their rights
 
06:59:57.890 --> 06:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
away by default and at the same time
 
07:00:00.110 --> 07:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
assume that government employees are
 
07:00:02.868 --> 07:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
somehow inherently trustworthy and good
 
07:00:04.968 --> 07:00:04.978 align:start position:0%
the last thing I'll say about this is
 
07:00:08.330 --> 07:00:08.340 align:start position:0%
that Cornerstone much preferred 1146 H
 
07:00:10.310 --> 07:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
which was the amendment to hb10
 
07:00:12.770 --> 07:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
introduced by Chief Justice Lynn
 
07:00:15.170 --> 07:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
relative to that Amendment this bill
 
07:00:17.750 --> 07:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
does actually provide a fairly wide
 
07:00:20.090 --> 07:00:20.100 align:start position:0%
latitude for courts to allow secret
 
07:00:22.548 --> 07:00:22.558 align:start position:0%
transitioning under a broader definition
 
07:00:25.430 --> 07:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
of abuse nonetheless this bill would be
 
07:00:27.230 --> 07:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
a tremendous improvement over the status
 
07:00:29.150 --> 07:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
quo where parents all around New
 
07:00:31.250 --> 07:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are discovering they have no
 
07:00:33.230 --> 07:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
rights against schools secretly
 
07:00:35.330 --> 07:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
transitioning their children and lying
 
07:00:37.128 --> 07:00:37.138 align:start position:0%
to them about it thank you and I'd be
 
07:00:41.270 --> 07:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
happy to to take any questions Mr chair
 
07:00:43.810 --> 07:00:43.820 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
07:00:50.628 --> 07:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:53.570 --> 07:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for taking the time
 
07:00:55.250 --> 07:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
today it's been a long day to hear
 
07:00:58.430 --> 07:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm with the ACLU of New
 
07:00:59.868 --> 07:00:59.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to
 
07:01:03.708 --> 07:01:03.718 align:start position:0%
Echo opposition to this bill because as
 
07:01:05.750 --> 07:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
we've heard through all of these
 
07:01:09.770 --> 07:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
statements SB 272 isn't about parental
 
07:01:12.650 --> 07:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
rights it's about singling out a
 
07:01:14.810 --> 07:01:14.820 align:start position:0%
specific historically marginalized group
 
07:01:17.868 --> 07:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
of people our lgbtq community and in
 
07:01:20.208 --> 07:01:20.218 align:start position:0%
particular trans students
 
07:01:22.730 --> 07:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
the singling out is in the plain text of
 
07:01:23.510 --> 07:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
07:01:26.448 --> 07:01:26.458 align:start position:0%
and it's in the intentions of the
 
07:01:29.208 --> 07:01:29.218 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation because in order
 
07:01:32.510 --> 07:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
for educators or for any school staff to
 
07:01:35.930 --> 07:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
comply with the text or else potentially
 
07:01:37.548 --> 07:01:37.558 align:start position:0%
face litigation
 
07:01:39.890 --> 07:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to surveil their
 
07:01:42.530 --> 07:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
teens behaviors and preferences that are
 
07:01:44.690 --> 07:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
linked to gender expression and gender
 
07:01:44.700 --> 07:01:46.610 align:start position:0%
linked to gender expression and gender
identity

07:01:46.610 --> 07:01:46.620 align:start position:0%
identity
 
07:01:49.250 --> 07:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
and we've heard from testimony from the
 
07:01:51.590 --> 07:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate and child
 
07:01:54.468 --> 07:01:54.478 align:start position:0%
welfare service providers that this can
 
07:01:54.478 --> 07:01:55.570 align:start position:0%
welfare service providers that this can
open

07:01:55.570 --> 07:01:55.580 align:start position:0%
open
 
07:01:59.208 --> 07:01:59.218 align:start position:0%
lgbtq teens to hostility rejection and
 
07:02:01.670 --> 07:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
even violence from their parents if this
 
07:02:03.410 --> 07:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
information is shared before they're
 
07:02:03.420 --> 07:02:04.548 align:start position:0%
information is shared before they're
ready

07:02:04.548 --> 07:02:04.558 align:start position:0%
ready
 
07:02:07.010 --> 07:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
these are not just merely conversations
 
07:02:08.930 --> 07:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
that are uncomfortable there's a real
 
07:02:11.270 --> 07:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
risk of harm and we've heard that from
 
07:02:13.368 --> 07:02:13.378 align:start position:0%
Advocates time and time again about this
 
07:02:13.378 --> 07:02:14.868 align:start position:0%
Advocates time and time again about this
legislation

07:02:14.868 --> 07:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
07:02:17.510 --> 07:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
we know that SB 272 also undermines
 
07:02:19.910 --> 07:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
existing state and federal protections
 
07:02:21.548 --> 07:02:21.558 align:start position:0%
for granite Staters
 
07:02:23.530 --> 07:02:23.540 align:start position:0%
it violates
 
07:02:26.150 --> 07:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional and statutory protections
 
07:02:28.128 --> 07:02:28.138 align:start position:0%
for transgender individuals to be free
 
07:02:30.650 --> 07:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
from discrimination on the basis of sex
 
07:02:32.868 --> 07:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
and gender identity and there have been
 
07:02:35.390 --> 07:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
numerous Federal and State Court rulings
 
07:02:37.670 --> 07:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
Nationwide that set precedent that
 
07:02:39.708 --> 07:02:39.718 align:start position:0%
individuals of gender identity should be
 
07:02:42.110 --> 07:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
free from discrimination
 
07:02:44.510 --> 07:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
I urge legislators to respect that
 
07:02:46.968 --> 07:02:46.978 align:start position:0%
students have free expression rights
 
07:02:48.830 --> 07:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
when they're at school and that this
 
07:02:50.750 --> 07:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
targeted surveillance and Reporting will
 
07:02:53.390 --> 07:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
only make transgender students feel as
 
07:02:56.628 --> 07:02:56.638 align:start position:0%
that they can't be their full selves
 
07:02:58.850 --> 07:02:58.860 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to underscore that the
 
07:03:00.530 --> 07:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
disclosure requirement or the right to
 
07:03:02.030 --> 07:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
know regarding extracurricular
 
07:03:05.090 --> 07:03:05.100 align:start position:0%
activities can also leave lgbtq students
 
07:03:07.310 --> 07:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
without access to safe or affirming
 
07:03:09.708 --> 07:03:09.718 align:start position:0%
environments and that this disclosure
 
07:03:11.990 --> 07:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
could result in lgbtq students in
 
07:03:14.810 --> 07:03:14.820 align:start position:0%
particular who attend gsas and other
 
07:03:16.968 --> 07:03:16.978 align:start position:0%
clubs to no longer view those as safe
 
07:03:19.430 --> 07:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
places to get the support that they need
 
07:03:21.830 --> 07:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
and this is really unfortunate because
 
07:03:25.490 --> 07:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
students with access to gsas are through
 
07:03:28.010 --> 07:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
research less likely to hear negative
 
07:03:30.410 --> 07:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
remarks about gender expression or being
 
07:03:33.048 --> 07:03:33.058 align:start position:0%
transgender to feel unsafe about their
 
07:03:35.090 --> 07:03:35.100 align:start position:0%
Identity or to miss school because of
 
07:03:37.670 --> 07:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
safety concerns and students with access
 
07:03:40.070 --> 07:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
to gsa's often experience lower levels
 
07:03:41.990 --> 07:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
of victimization related to their
 
07:03:44.330 --> 07:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
identity and report a greater sense of
 
07:03:47.390 --> 07:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
belonging to their school and community
 
07:03:49.788 --> 07:03:49.798 align:start position:0%
it's important that we maintain your
 
07:03:52.190 --> 07:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
time is up thank you so much I encourage
 
07:03:54.670 --> 07:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
you to itl this Bill thank you
 
07:04:00.368 --> 07:04:00.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:13.070 --> 07:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:17.270 --> 07:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
well good afternoon my name is Deb has I
 
07:04:18.890 --> 07:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
am president of the American Federation
 
07:04:21.230 --> 07:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
of teachers New Hampshire and I am here
 
07:04:24.368 --> 07:04:24.378 align:start position:0%
to speak in opposition to SB 272
 
07:04:26.510 --> 07:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
particularly because of Those portions
 
07:04:29.230 --> 07:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
that um
 
07:04:33.590 --> 07:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
would affect our public schools and how
 
07:04:38.468 --> 07:04:38.478 align:start position:0%
they deal with LBD LBT G cute students
 
07:04:41.448 --> 07:04:41.458 align:start position:0%
aft stands for public schools they are
 
07:04:43.190 --> 07:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
safe and welcoming and inclusive for all
 
07:04:45.910 --> 07:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
students and that includes our
 
07:04:48.948 --> 07:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus students this so-called
 
07:04:52.368 --> 07:04:52.378 align:start position:0%
parental Bill of Rights SB 272 has very
 
07:04:54.230 --> 07:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
little to do with actually helping our
 
07:04:55.968 --> 07:04:55.978 align:start position:0%
students learn and thrive in school
 
07:04:58.310 --> 07:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
instead it would force schools to divert
 
07:05:00.890 --> 07:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
their limited resources from teaching
 
07:05:03.110 --> 07:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
and supporting kids into spying
 
07:05:05.270 --> 07:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
reporting on and in some cases actually
 
07:05:07.910 --> 07:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
outing and endangering children or just
 
07:05:10.190 --> 07:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
trying to be themselves and live their
 
07:05:10.200 --> 07:05:11.830 align:start position:0%
trying to be themselves and live their
lives

07:05:11.830 --> 07:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
lives
 
07:05:14.030 --> 07:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
it would
 
07:05:17.330 --> 07:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
Force students to act as surveillance
 
07:05:19.610 --> 07:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
agents but only on certain students
 
07:05:23.390 --> 07:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
particularly students that are perceived
 
07:05:26.030 --> 07:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
to be or engaging in behaviors that
 
07:05:30.128 --> 07:05:30.138 align:start position:0%
might mark them as members of the LG
 
07:05:32.810 --> 07:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
btq community
 
07:05:35.628 --> 07:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
and because of that it's discriminatory
 
07:05:38.208 --> 07:05:38.218 align:start position:0%
so you'll be asking teachers and School
 
07:05:40.490 --> 07:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
staff to discriminate against some of
 
07:05:42.830 --> 07:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
their own students and much earlier
 
07:05:45.650 --> 07:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
today I heard someone speculating on why
 
07:05:47.570 --> 07:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
teachers are leaving the profession
 
07:05:49.788 --> 07:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
ask us to discriminate against our
 
07:05:49.798 --> 07:05:50.810 align:start position:0%
ask us to discriminate against our
students

07:05:50.810 --> 07:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
students
 
07:05:52.968 --> 07:05:52.978 align:start position:0%
you'll drive us out
 
07:05:54.830 --> 07:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
I mean you add that on top of the low
 
07:05:56.510 --> 07:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
pay and everything else ask us to
 
07:05:58.548 --> 07:05:58.558 align:start position:0%
discriminate against our students ask us
 
07:06:00.948 --> 07:06:00.958 align:start position:0%
to violate the code of conduct and the
 
07:06:06.048 --> 07:06:06.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:06.058 --> 07:06:08.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:06:08.390 --> 07:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:06:11.030 --> 07:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
SP 272 would impose chilling
 
07:06:13.368 --> 07:06:13.378 align:start position:0%
mccarthyistic Broad and vague restraints
 
07:06:14.990 --> 07:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
that will hinder schools from providing
 
07:06:16.670 --> 07:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
the safe welcoming learning environment
 
07:06:18.530 --> 07:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
that promotes learning and success for
 
07:06:20.868 --> 07:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
all kids and welcomes all children and
 
07:06:23.208 --> 07:06:23.218 align:start position:0%
families this bill tells teachers and
 
07:06:25.250 --> 07:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
School staff they must put aside any
 
07:06:27.830 --> 07:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
obligation to the student it Outlaws the
 
07:06:30.410 --> 07:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
human courtesy and kindness that can be
 
07:06:32.090 --> 07:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
as simple as treating students with
 
07:06:32.100 --> 07:06:33.110 align:start position:0%
as simple as treating students with
respect

07:06:33.110 --> 07:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
respect
 
07:06:34.968 --> 07:06:34.978 align:start position:0%
and that's what we
 
07:06:37.490 --> 07:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
always strive to do
 
07:06:42.230 --> 07:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
to help run our classrooms in a a manner
 
07:06:44.150 --> 07:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
that functions well so our students can
 
07:06:44.160 --> 07:06:47.448 align:start position:0%
that functions well so our students can
learn

07:06:47.448 --> 07:06:47.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:50.330 --> 07:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
it puts Pages stuck together because I'm
 
07:06:52.250 --> 07:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
just sitting here way too long it puts
 
07:06:54.708 --> 07:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
education no wind bind when they try and
 
07:06:56.750 --> 07:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
teach any District approved curriculum
 
07:06:57.948 --> 07:06:57.958 align:start position:0%
that conflicts with the Bill's
 
07:07:00.110 --> 07:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
requirement and as our social worker
 
07:07:01.910 --> 07:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues have pointed out in some
 
07:07:04.430 --> 07:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
cases this bill will put some students
 
07:07:06.890 --> 07:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
in danger at home in cases where parents
 
07:07:09.170 --> 07:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
are unsupportive or actually abusive to
 
07:07:12.590 --> 07:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
our child who is lgbtq plus Deborah time
 
07:07:15.230 --> 07:07:15.240 align:start position:0%

today to speak in opposition to Senate
 
07:07:55.010 --> 07:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
bill 272. over the past decade already
 
07:07:56.990 --> 07:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
high suicide rates have been rising in
 
07:07:58.670 --> 07:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
the United States and in New Hampshire
 
07:08:01.368 --> 07:08:01.378 align:start position:0%
today in the granite state suicide is
 
07:08:03.948 --> 07:08:03.958 align:start position:0%
the second leading cause of death for 10
 
07:08:06.048 --> 07:08:06.058 align:start position:0%
to 24 year olds
 
07:08:08.750 --> 07:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
and we know fifteen thousand youth ages
 
07:08:11.810 --> 07:08:11.820 align:start position:0%
12 to 17 have depression in our state
 
07:08:15.170 --> 07:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
recent results from the 2021 yrbs survey
 
07:08:17.090 --> 07:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
showed that 24
 
07:08:19.670 --> 07:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
.7 percent of New Hampshire High School
 
07:08:21.708 --> 07:08:21.718 align:start position:0%
students seriously considered suicide
 
07:08:24.170 --> 07:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
that's one quarter that's not a trans
 
07:08:27.250 --> 07:08:27.260 align:start position:0%
kids that's of all kids
 
07:08:30.708 --> 07:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
19.3 percent made a plan for suicide and
 
07:08:34.250 --> 07:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
9.8 attempted suicide in the 12 months
 
07:08:36.468 --> 07:08:36.478 align:start position:0%
preceding the survey this is a
 
07:08:38.510 --> 07:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
significant increase over the 2019
 
07:08:38.520 --> 07:08:39.708 align:start position:0%
significant increase over the 2019
numbers

07:08:39.708 --> 07:08:39.718 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
07:08:42.948 --> 07:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
according to the CDC lgbtq youth
 
07:08:44.628 --> 07:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
represent a significant high-risk
 
07:08:47.150 --> 07:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
subgroup as evidenced by higher rates of
 
07:08:48.830 --> 07:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
suicide attempts and more lethal
 
07:08:48.840 --> 07:08:49.850 align:start position:0%

attempts
 
07:08:52.250 --> 07:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
we know that for transgender individuals
 
07:08:54.708 --> 07:08:54.718 align:start position:0%
lack of school belonging internalized
 
07:08:56.990 --> 07:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
stigma and emotional family neglect
 
07:09:00.288 --> 07:09:00.298 align:start position:0%
significantly contribute to suicidality
 
07:09:03.650 --> 07:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 272 only serves to create a
 
07:09:05.448 --> 07:09:05.458 align:start position:0%
less welcoming and affirming environment
 
07:09:08.330 --> 07:09:08.340 align:start position:0%
for these kids in their schools and may
 
07:09:10.070 --> 07:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
potentially expose them to dangerous
 
07:09:12.048 --> 07:09:12.058 align:start position:0%
family rejection
 
07:09:14.208 --> 07:09:14.218 align:start position:0%
Nami New Hampshire actively works with
 
07:09:16.250 --> 07:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
schools on suicide prevention through
 
07:09:17.930 --> 07:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
the Nami New Hampshire connect program

07:09:24.530 --> 07:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
designated as a national best practice
 
07:09:27.468 --> 07:09:27.478 align:start position:0%
in suicide prevention intervention in
 
07:09:30.110 --> 07:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
postvention and has trained in over 40

States and 35 tribal Nations
 
07:09:34.968 --> 07:09:34.978 align:start position:0%
as a part of the connect program youth
 
07:09:36.650 --> 07:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
are encouraged to connect with a trusted
 
07:09:38.628 --> 07:09:38.638 align:start position:0%

the language contained on page 4 line
 
07:09:48.230 --> 07:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
17-25 could create a chilling effect for
 
07:09:50.030 --> 07:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
all students in approaching School

crisis
 
07:09:55.968 --> 07:09:55.978 align:start position:0%
it may also disconnect Educators from
 
07:09:57.708 --> 07:09:57.718 align:start position:0%
their system of support and paralyze
 
07:09:59.448 --> 07:09:59.458 align:start position:0%
them when questioning what steps need to
 
07:10:02.690 --> 07:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
be taken to ensure a student's safety in
 
07:10:04.670 --> 07:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
a time when youth suicide rates are very
 
07:10:07.190 --> 07:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
high New Hampshire needs to take any and
 
07:10:09.770 --> 07:10:09.780 align:start position:0%
all measures to prevent suicide deaths
 
07:10:11.690 --> 07:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
and suicide attempts
 
07:10:14.570 --> 07:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 272 legislatively creates an
 
07:10:16.788 --> 07:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
atmosphere in schools that discourages
 
07:10:18.650 --> 07:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
youth from seeking the assistance of a
 
07:10:19.850 --> 07:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
trusted adult
 
07:10:22.070 --> 07:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
causes confusion for school Personnel
 
07:10:23.690 --> 07:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
about what steps to take of a student
 
07:10:26.330 --> 07:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
comes to them in crisis and is counter
 
07:10:28.128 --> 07:10:28.138 align:start position:0%
to the suicide prevention work that is
 
07:10:29.810 --> 07:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
being done in our state
 
07:10:31.968 --> 07:10:31.978 align:start position:0%
in a time when creating accepting and
 
07:10:34.010 --> 07:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
affirming spaces is Paramount your time
 
07:10:36.170 --> 07:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
is up thank you simply put certain
 
07:10:37.968 --> 07:10:37.978 align:start position:0%
provisions of this bill would be
 
07:10:39.590 --> 07:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
damaging to students and we encourage
 
07:10:43.788 --> 07:10:43.798 align:start position:0%

um Sebastian asked if I would read his
 
07:10:59.390 --> 07:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
testimony he is also a father of four
 
07:11:03.230 --> 07:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
and to go home and take on Daddy Duty

um
 
07:11:06.650 --> 07:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
so he asked me to read the following it
 
07:11:08.270 --> 07:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
is the responsibility of schools
 
07:11:09.948 --> 07:11:09.958 align:start position:0%
Educators and every person in this room
 
07:11:12.110 --> 07:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
to take proactive steps to protect all
 
07:11:15.110 --> 07:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
students including lgbtq students from
 
07:11:17.448 --> 07:11:17.458 align:start position:0%
discrimination harassment bullying and
 
07:11:18.830 --> 07:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
to create a supportive and affirming
 
07:11:20.930 --> 07:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
space for them to learn and grow
 
07:11:22.250 --> 07:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
schools should be a place where they
 
07:11:24.288 --> 07:11:24.298 align:start position:0%
find safety in a nurturing hand
 
07:11:26.150 --> 07:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
creating the space means implementing
 
07:11:28.310 --> 07:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
policies and practices that address bias
 
07:11:30.368 --> 07:11:30.378 align:start position:0%
and promote acceptance and understanding
 
07:11:32.628 --> 07:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
providing resources and support for
 
07:11:35.090 --> 07:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
lgbtq students and their families and
 
07:11:36.530 --> 07:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
fostering a culture of respect and
 
07:11:37.968 --> 07:11:37.978 align:start position:0%
inclusivity throughout the school
 
07:11:37.978 --> 07:11:39.350 align:start position:0%
inclusivity throughout the school
community

07:11:39.350 --> 07:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
community
 
07:11:41.448 --> 07:11:41.458 align:start position:0%
let me on his behalf share a radical
 
07:11:44.448 --> 07:11:44.458 align:start position:0%
idea instead of advocating for the false
 
07:11:46.490 --> 07:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
premise of quote parental rights that
 
07:11:49.430 --> 07:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
actually harms lgbtq students we should
 
07:11:51.288 --> 07:11:51.298 align:start position:0%
be advocating for a student's Bill of
 
07:11:53.030 --> 07:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
Rights this would include the right to
 
07:11:55.490 --> 07:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
an inclusive and honest education the
 
07:11:57.288 --> 07:11:57.298 align:start position:0%
right to no cost School meals for all
 
07:12:00.110 --> 07:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
students the right for protections to
 
07:12:01.730 --> 07:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
protections for educators who offer
 
07:12:03.650 --> 07:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
students a safe inclusive and honest
 
07:12:05.628 --> 07:12:05.638 align:start position:0%
environment it would also include the

will cause direct harm to our children

this bill's invasive requirement that

well-being of lgbtq Youth these

accepting Place away from parents for

as you just heard lgbtq students in
 
07:14:14.090 --> 07:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
schools with gsas feel safer are more
 
07:14:15.590 --> 07:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
likely to come to class and feel a

just for members even students who

07:14:24.350 --> 07:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
that schools with lgbtq inclusive

students
 
07:14:34.430 --> 07:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
gsas can be particularly effective in
 
07:14:35.990 --> 07:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
preparing students to talk to their
 
07:14:37.610 --> 07:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
parents about their gender or sexual
 
07:14:37.620 --> 07:14:38.990 align:start position:0%

07:14:41.150 --> 07:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
they also provide a comforting place for

students who aren't accepted at home and
 
07:14:44.990 --> 07:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
that support from peers can be crucial
 
07:14:47.090 --> 07:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
to those young people's Mental Health
 
07:14:49.310 --> 07:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
to effectively perform these essential
 
07:14:52.070 --> 07:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
functions gsas cannot be forced to track
 
07:14:53.690 --> 07:14:53.700 align:start position:0%
and report to parents on student
 
07:14:53.700 --> 07:14:55.190 align:start position:0%

participation

07:14:55.190 --> 07:14:55.200 align:start position:0%

07:15:04.788 --> 07:15:04.798 align:start position:0%
this GSA surveillance requirement also
 
07:15:06.410 --> 07:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
conflicts with a federal equal access

Act

07:15:07.548 --> 07:15:07.558 align:start position:0%
Act
 
07:15:09.590 --> 07:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
in the 1990s New York a group of
 
07:15:10.968 --> 07:15:10.978 align:start position:0%
Christian students formed a Bible club
 
07:15:12.770 --> 07:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
and wanted a club ruled that only
 
07:15:14.690 --> 07:15:14.700 align:start position:0%
Christians could be officers the school
 
07:15:15.890 --> 07:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
objected saying that their
 
07:15:18.288 --> 07:15:18.298 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination policy was
 
07:15:19.548 --> 07:15:19.558 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with that and wouldn't
 
07:15:20.930 --> 07:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
permit the Bible Club to only have
 
07:15:23.330 --> 07:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
Christian leaders the students sued and
 
07:15:24.830 --> 07:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
in the resulting Court decision the
 
07:15:26.750 --> 07:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in
 
07:15:28.250 --> 07:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
favor of the Bible Club
 
07:15:30.770 --> 07:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
the court found that because Christian
 
07:15:32.510 --> 07:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
leadership was essential to the Bible
 
07:15:34.430 --> 07:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
Club the district couldn't prevent it
 
07:15:35.930 --> 07:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
even though the non-discrimination
 
07:15:38.330 --> 07:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
policy was neutrally applied the court
 
07:15:40.730 --> 07:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
provided a helpful analogy to elaborate
 
07:15:42.830 --> 07:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
a role requiring students to wear
 
07:15:45.170 --> 07:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
appropriate Footwear at all times might
 
07:15:47.150 --> 07:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
effectively ban after-school meetings of
 
07:15:49.128 --> 07:15:49.138 align:start position:0%
the yoga Club
 
07:15:51.830 --> 07:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
similarly it is an essential function of
 
07:15:55.368 --> 07:15:55.378 align:start position:0%
gsas to prepare and support lgbtq youth
 
07:15:57.110 --> 07:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
to talk to their families about their
 
07:15:59.750 --> 07:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
gender or social sexual orientation when
 
07:16:02.570 --> 07:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
the student is ready and not sooner
 
07:16:04.788 --> 07:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
gsas would not be the critical safe
 
07:16:07.010 --> 07:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
spaces we need them to be if they were
 
07:16:08.930 --> 07:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
forced to surveil and report on their
 
07:16:12.468 --> 07:16:12.478 align:start position:0%
members accordingly SB 272 is in direct
 
07:16:14.090 --> 07:16:14.100 align:start position:0%

lgbtq people into this bill we're not
 
07:17:21.890 --> 07:17:21.900 align:start position:0%

a small but loud group of people

committed to misunderstanding this do
 
07:17:28.368 --> 07:17:28.378 align:start position:0%
not speak for all parents we won't be

parental rights parents can and do have
 
07:17:34.368 --> 07:17:34.378 align:start position:0%

that they are regularly notified of them
 
07:17:39.468 --> 07:17:39.478 align:start position:0%
every lgbtq person should be able to

07:17:55.610 --> 07:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
believe us when we talk about our own
 
07:17:57.948 --> 07:17:57.958 align:start position:0%
experiences and when we tell you that it
 
07:17:59.930 --> 07:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
is not safe for others to know that we
 
07:18:03.048 --> 07:18:03.058 align:start position:0%
are lgbtq including family members and

being outed to parents or other family

whether that's conversion therapy or

other abuse my father emotionally abused
 
07:18:18.410 --> 07:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
me when he found out that I was queer in
 
07:18:20.270 --> 07:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
high school before I felt safe to tell
 
07:18:22.910 --> 07:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
him and my relationships with supportive
 
07:18:25.250 --> 07:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
friends and teachers at school kept me
 
07:18:27.530 --> 07:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
alive through that daily abuse
 
07:18:29.270 --> 07:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
he regularly told me that I was
 
07:18:31.430 --> 07:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
disgusting immoral and going to hell
 
07:18:34.010 --> 07:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
unless I changed who I was on a regular
 
07:18:36.468 --> 07:18:36.478 align:start position:0%
basis if he had been notified that I was
 
07:18:38.750 --> 07:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
a member of a GSA he would have made it
 
07:18:41.390 --> 07:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
his mission to go to the club pull me
 
07:18:44.448 --> 07:18:44.458 align:start position:0%
out and keep me from attending
 
07:18:46.548 --> 07:18:46.558 align:start position:0%
like many of the speakers here today he
 
07:18:48.410 --> 07:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
told me that he didn't judge me he was
 
07:18:52.910 --> 07:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:55.128 --> 07:18:55.138 align:start position:0%
do not be fooled by the transitioners
 
07:18:57.890 --> 07:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
transition is not for everyone the vast
 
07:18:59.750 --> 07:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
majority of trans people will tell you
 
07:19:02.750 --> 07:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
that the long Maze of about the long
 
07:19:04.968 --> 07:19:04.978 align:start position:0%
Maze of Hoops we have to jump through to
 
07:19:07.670 --> 07:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
access basic health care d-transitioners
 
07:19:09.468 --> 07:19:09.478 align:start position:0%
can have complex feelings about their
 
07:19:11.990 --> 07:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
bodies just like any of us the problem
 
07:19:14.690 --> 07:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
comes from when they try to deny trans
 
07:19:17.628 --> 07:19:17.638 align:start position:0%
and non-binary people the same bodily
 
07:19:19.368 --> 07:19:19.378 align:start position:0%
autonomy that allowed them to say
 
07:19:22.010 --> 07:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
actually this isn't for me
 
07:19:24.770 --> 07:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
this bill is not based in reality it
 
07:19:26.448 --> 07:19:26.458 align:start position:0%
claims to have loopholes for situations
 
07:19:29.270 --> 07:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
of abuse and neglect but rights a higher
 
07:19:32.330 --> 07:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
legal standard into the law past the
 
07:19:34.968 --> 07:19:34.978 align:start position:0%
existing legal standard for abuse and
 
07:19:37.368 --> 07:19:37.378 align:start position:0%
neglect that is based on assumptions of
 
07:19:39.890 --> 07:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
information and training that teachers
 
07:19:42.530 --> 07:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
simply do not have thank you
 
07:19:49.670 --> 07:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:51.708 --> 07:19:51.718 align:start position:0%
out of Boston Mass
 
07:19:53.750 --> 07:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
hi everyone you have my um written
 
07:19:55.850 --> 07:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
testimony submitted by by my colleague
 
07:19:58.128 --> 07:19:58.138 align:start position:0%
we submitted it jointly
 
07:20:01.310 --> 07:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
um 500 500 bills that's how many bills
 
07:20:02.868 --> 07:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
targeting lgbtq people have been
 
07:20:04.610 --> 07:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
introduced in state legislatures across
 
07:20:07.548 --> 07:20:07.558 align:start position:0%
the country this year in 2023 500 bills
 
07:20:09.350 --> 07:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
and more than 30 of them have been
 
07:20:12.170 --> 07:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
passed into law already Senate Bill 272
 
07:20:14.868 --> 07:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
could add to the list I want to mention
 
07:20:16.968 --> 07:20:16.978 align:start position:0%
this partly to create a context to
 
07:20:18.830 --> 07:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
understand the emotional energy in this
 
07:20:21.410 --> 07:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
room to understand people's passion fear
 
07:20:23.510 --> 07:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
confusion and anger that's been
 
07:20:26.570 --> 07:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
permeating this discussion today I also
 
07:20:28.368 --> 07:20:28.378 align:start position:0%
want to mention it to highlight to
 
07:20:30.890 --> 07:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
underscore that it belies what's
 
07:20:32.628 --> 07:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
actually motivating this piece of
 
07:20:34.548 --> 07:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
legislation make no mistake that
 
07:20:35.930 --> 07:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
parental bills of rights are being
 
07:20:37.730 --> 07:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
introduced across the country and
 
07:20:39.048 --> 07:20:39.058 align:start position:0%
they're all doing the same thing which
 
07:20:40.910 --> 07:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
is targeting transgender youth
 
07:20:42.650 --> 07:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
especially for a special level of
 
07:20:44.390 --> 07:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
surveillance for a special level of
 
07:20:46.670 --> 07:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
reporting back to parents and this bill
 
07:20:50.030 --> 07:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
does not exist in a vacuum
 
07:20:51.948 --> 07:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lot of misinformation today
 
07:20:54.410 --> 07:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
including crazy things like blockers are
 
07:20:56.270 --> 07:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
being distributed at schools which is
 
07:20:57.948 --> 07:20:57.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely false
 
07:21:00.170 --> 07:21:00.180 align:start position:0%
um but one of the biggest falsehoods
 
07:21:02.090 --> 07:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
that has been repeated multiple times
 
07:21:04.090 --> 07:21:04.100 align:start position:0%
today I really want to draw attention to
 
07:21:06.650 --> 07:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
policy jbab
 
07:21:08.390 --> 07:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
I really encourage you to look up Nash
 
07:21:11.090 --> 07:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
OS policy Manchester's policy the policy
 
07:21:12.468 --> 07:21:12.478 align:start position:0%
in Milford the policy in Guilford
 
07:21:14.448 --> 07:21:14.458 align:start position:0%
they're all basically the same thing the
 
07:21:16.310 --> 07:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
Hallmark in each one of those policies
 
07:21:18.770 --> 07:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
is flexibility the policy lays out at
 
07:21:20.570 --> 07:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
the beginning guidelines these are
 
07:21:22.548 --> 07:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
guidelines that are meant to meet the
 
07:21:24.350 --> 07:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
individual needs of individual students
 
07:21:26.510 --> 07:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
and apply it in an individualized
 
07:21:28.490 --> 07:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
fashion these policies are not
 
07:21:31.670 --> 07:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
brightline rules in any sense beyond
 
07:21:33.830 --> 07:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
that there is no directive you can find
 
07:21:36.830 --> 07:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
in these policies that tells that tells
 
07:21:38.390 --> 07:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
schools anything about how they have to
 
07:21:40.250 --> 07:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
give misinformation to parents that is
 
07:21:41.448 --> 07:21:41.458 align:start position:0%
false or how they have to conceal
 
07:21:43.850 --> 07:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
information from parents that is a false
 
07:21:45.830 --> 07:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
reading you have to do mental gymnastics
 
07:21:48.288 --> 07:21:48.298 align:start position:0%
to get there out of respect for parents
 
07:21:50.810 --> 07:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
and in deference to them unless
 
07:21:53.690 --> 07:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
instructed otherwise School staff should
 
07:21:56.030 --> 07:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
use the students enrollment name when
 
07:21:57.948 --> 07:21:57.958 align:start position:0%
talking to the student's family that's
 
07:22:00.650 --> 07:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
it that's just basic respect it's not a
 
07:22:02.750 --> 07:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
directive to lie to parents
 
07:22:05.510 --> 07:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
school policies like jbab are adopted
 
07:22:07.548 --> 07:22:07.558 align:start position:0%
democratically by democratically elected
 
07:22:09.468 --> 07:22:09.478 align:start position:0%
school boards with public input at
 
07:22:11.868 --> 07:22:11.878 align:start position:0%
public meetings they're not this
 
07:22:13.910 --> 07:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
directive that comes down from an uh
 
07:22:15.530 --> 07:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
from an autocratic School Board the way
 
07:22:16.910 --> 07:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
that it's been portrayed here in this
 
07:22:19.850 --> 07:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
room uh these if people have problems
 
07:22:21.350 --> 07:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
with the policies that are being enacted
 
07:22:22.968 --> 07:22:22.978 align:start position:0%
by their school boards they ought to and
 
07:22:25.490 --> 07:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
they do participate in that process and
 
07:22:27.590 --> 07:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's how we get policies that reflect
 
07:22:29.150 --> 07:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
the values of a community in the school
 
07:22:29.160 --> 07:22:30.170 align:start position:0%
the values of a community in the school
district

07:22:30.170 --> 07:22:30.180 align:start position:0%
district
 
07:22:33.110 --> 07:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh this bill ties the hands of school
 
07:22:34.910 --> 07:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
policy makers and it ties the hands of
 
07:22:37.490 --> 07:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
Educators it makes it so that
 
07:22:39.770 --> 07:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
trusted adults in schools can't help
 
07:22:41.690 --> 07:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
facilitate encourage and promote
 
07:22:43.610 --> 07:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
conversation with families it puts them
 
07:22:45.650 --> 07:22:45.660 align:start position:0%
in a box where they have no choice but
 
07:22:47.868 --> 07:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
to surveil and Report or otherwise not
 
07:22:49.968 --> 07:22:49.978 align:start position:0%
take information I'm going to stop now
 
07:22:51.350 --> 07:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
but there was a question about the
 
07:22:53.270 --> 07:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal note asked earlier and I'm happy
 
07:22:54.948 --> 07:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
to like answer it because I believe I
 
07:22:56.990 --> 07:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
can pretty thoroughly give a better
 
07:22:58.128 --> 07:22:58.138 align:start position:0%
explanation than what you might have
 
07:23:01.310 --> 07:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
heard earlier thank you very much
 
07:23:03.230 --> 07:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
no question so thank you no question
 
07:23:03.240 --> 07:23:04.788 align:start position:0%
no question so thank you no question
okay

07:23:04.788 --> 07:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:23:07.610 --> 07:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
that it was the last pink card we have
 
07:23:10.670 --> 07:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
up here is there anybody out there that
 
07:23:14.090 --> 07:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
believes they submitted a pink card and
 
07:23:17.150 --> 07:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
if not not seeing any uh I'm going to
 
07:23:20.090 --> 07:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
close this hearing on 272. thank you for
 
07:23:28.610 --> 07:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:28.620 --> 07:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
okay
