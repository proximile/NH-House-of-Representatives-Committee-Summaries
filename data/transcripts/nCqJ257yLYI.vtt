before uh before we kick off this
 
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
morning i just want to
 
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
there's been a bunch of emails floating
 
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
around relative to
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
our plan for wednesday afternoon
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
and because it's a little atypical
 
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to also be able to
 
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
describe in
 
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 align:start position:0%
in real time what i what i think we're
 
00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:46.710 align:start position:0%
in real time what i what i think we're
doing

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
i think what we're doing is that we
 
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we were really being accessible
 
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
to the public and that we wanted to have
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
our committee members
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
reach out to individuals
 
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
who we think have a particular point of
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
view that we need to consider
 
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
in order to make our decisions relative
 
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
to the dhhs
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
and veterans home budgets so each member
 
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
was giving a given a 20-minute time
 
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
allotment there no requirement to use it
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative weiler is not going to
 
00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
have a guest
 
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
come in but we'll start at 1
 
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
30 on the afternoon of the 10th
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
with a 20-minute allotment per speaker
 
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
or speaker group
 
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
i think we could be done by three
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
o'clock and if we go a little long
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
we will go a little long it's an
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
aspirational goal representative
 
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
right so uh
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
we'll uh and then there was a
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative a question by
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
representative rogers today about
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
can they present powerpoints and and i
 
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.350 align:start position:0%
can they present powerpoints and and i
think

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
that it's important for us to learn so
 
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.550 align:start position:0%
that it's important for us to learn so
if

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
a powerpoint will help us learn then
 
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
yeah they can use a powerpoint i would
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
just encourage them to
 
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
maintain their time discipline so that
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
hear everyone in the time allotted so um
 
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
so we'll figure out how to get a
 
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
powerpoint up i think mr ripple can get
 
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.909 align:start position:0%
powerpoint up i think mr ripple can get
them

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
get them in a position to be able to
 
00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.950 align:start position:0%
get them in a position to be able to
share

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
so the only thing that's outstanding

the meeting
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
on which line numbers or which
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
account numbers they're really talking
 
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.350 align:start position:0%
account numbers they're really talking
about

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
so that when when they start we've
 
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.189 align:start position:0%
so that when when they start we've
already

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
figured out what aspect of the budget
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
we're referring to
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
and that and that we've done our
 
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
homework to get our head ready to hear
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
what they have to say
 
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
so um if we could get them to specify
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
which aspect of the or which line items
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
of the budget they're referring to that
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
would be great
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh with that are there any questions
 
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
from the committee relative to what
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
today's agenda yep sure today you have
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
the division of medicaid services and
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
karen is here as usual
 
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
and uh the director henry lipman is here
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
along with a few other people from the
 
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.909 align:start position:0%
along with a few other people from the
department

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
you said that oh yeah i see henry now
 
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay great um
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
chair may i ask a question about
 
00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:42.830 align:start position:0%
chair may i ask a question about
wednesday

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
yes so we have public health scheduled
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
to present on wednesday
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
is your plan to just have them present
 
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
in the morning and then if they need
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
longer that they would go
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
into next monday um they do have about
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
the 90 accounting units so it does take
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
some time
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
so what i thought we'd be able to do is
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
if we start at our normal time that's in
 
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
the house calendar
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
yeah and just from the way these
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
have been paced i thought we could wrap
 
00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:15.759 align:start position:0%
up by 130.
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
okay and then from 130 on it's one we'd
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
have the
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
other speakers come in if if you don't
 
00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:23.909 align:start position:0%
other speakers come in if if you don't
think

00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
130 can work then you know
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
let's talk about it and i can slide our
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
guest speakers that's
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
really kind of the optional part of the
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
day and the flexible part of the day
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
we we need to hear from you all in the
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
public health group without
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
um you know causing you to go so fast
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
we're missing your points
 
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
okay all right great sorry karen the
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
other thing i would point out is that
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
you have part two of public health
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%

00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%

00:08:53.839 --> 00:08:55.190 align:start position:0%

comports with what you were expecting uh
 
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%

um and uh that's okay i'll just launch
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
into it
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's all right we're all ready um
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
so just as a setting um division of
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
medicaid services this is where you'd
 
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.150 align:start position:0%
medicaid services this is where you'd
find

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
our department identifiers i think the
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
two key people in the presentation today
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
will be myself and athena gagnon the
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid finance director
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
we also have with us today the
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
administrator of our quality
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
program supporting medicaid patrick
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
mcgowan and
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
david weeders the director of
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
information systems for
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
the department um and they'll i'll work
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
them into the presentation at
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate times
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's all right so
 
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
i think one of the things you wanted us
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
to start out with is what is the
 
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
mission and vision of the division of
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
medicaid services
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
henry yes it's not moving we're just
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
still seeing the presentation
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
not the slides okay
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for letting me know no
 
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.230 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for letting me know no
problem

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
if your screen sharing you just it
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
should just show
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
what you're what you're seeing yeah if i
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
had to guess
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
dave just went off camera so he's on his
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
i'm actually remote today so i'm not
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
going to be able to go to his office oh
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
darn i thought that's why
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
beautiful background you have there
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%

00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:22.839 align:start position:0%
excellent choice in are you seeing
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
backgrounds slide
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay in athena
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
i i get the humor of your background by
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
the way just in case you're wondering if
 
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.069 align:start position:0%
the way just in case you're wondering if
anyone

00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%

yes okay thank you
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
um maybe it'll work better if i
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
work it this way as opposed to doing it
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
through the
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
actual screen presentation um so
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
i think where we were starting on the
 
00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:08.150 align:start position:0%
i think where we were starting on the
mission

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
mission
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
and vision of the department of medicaid
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
division of medicaid services
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
again in this division a large part of
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
is provide health insurance coverage to
 
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
a variety of populations
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
medicaid is largely a categorical
 
00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:26.870 align:start position:0%
medicaid is largely a categorical
program

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
for example the individuals who are
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
elderly and poor
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
the aged the blind the disabled
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
and so forth we provide a managed care
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
program medicaid care management program
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
through three commercial mcos
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
and what we look to do is to run that
 
00:13:48.959 --> 00:13:49.990 align:start position:0%
and what we look to do is to run that
program

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
um effectively and efficiently and also
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
just because we're caring for so many in
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
um nearly one in seven at any one time
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
currently we want to make sure that
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
they're receiving quality services with
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
good customer service
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
and in addition to the managed care
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
program we're also
 
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
so um covered a couple points on this
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
slide where
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
we are a publicly funded program and
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
we'll get into
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
um what components the state pays for
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
um other funds pay for as well as the
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
today we um you know my first statistic
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
here is we
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
as of the end of january we're at 214
 
00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:37.910 align:start position:0%
as of the end of january we're at 214
000

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
individuals and just
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
update those stats as of last
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
monday we're covering two hundred and
 
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
five hundred three people in total um
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
72 793 of those individuals
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
were through the granite advantage or
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes known as medicaid expandage
 
00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:01.959 align:start position:0%
expansion and 142
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
760 in the standard program which
 
00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:05.829 align:start position:0%
760 in the standard program which
includes

00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
includes
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
covering the children and the increase
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
since the start of public health
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
emergency the week of march 16th we've
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
seen a total increase of 38 083
 
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.710 align:start position:0%
seen a total increase of 38 083
individuals

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
21 and a half percent increase the
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
granite advantage component which is
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
a component that's driven off of income
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
saw the largest increase 41.6
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
or 21 378. and the standard program
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
is up to 13.3 or 16 705 individuals
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
our division operates programs as well
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
as provides
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
the interface with the federal
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
government centers for medicare and
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
medicaid services
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
we provide support to other divisions
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
that you'll
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
you've heard from or we'll hear from
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
over the course of uh
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
your hearings and basically we're
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
the centers for medicaid medicare
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
services looks for a point of contact
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
me as the medicaid director but we're
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
basically i describe medicaid as a team
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
sport we
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
we support in um both on the technical
 
00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:16.150 align:start position:0%
we support in um both on the technical
side

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
and on the federal claiming side these
 
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
divisions i won't read these all
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
here to you but there'll be all the
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
divisions that you meet with
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
offering a medicaid program is
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
technically an
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
elective for states all 50 states
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
participate um in the medicaid program
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
actually there are also territories of
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
the united states that i think there's
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
seven or eight
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
territories that also participate in
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
medicaid um
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
if you do participate as a state there
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
are certain
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
things that you have to do in terms of
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
offering i see you're asking a question
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
about this i i do i um as you go through
 
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.350 align:start position:0%
about this i i do i um as you go through
this

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
um i i i hope part of what you think
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to walk away with
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
is i would like to understand the extent
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
to which
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
medicaid is offered as a managed care
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
service and that we have so many
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
initiatives in
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
dhhs to build out a systems of care
 
00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:16.949 align:start position:0%
dhhs to build out a systems of care
model

00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
model
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know uh the extent to which
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
the medicaid component of our health
 
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.270 align:start position:0%
the medicaid component of our health
system

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
is actually amenable to
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
being wrapped in a systems of care model
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know if you're going to find
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
that in your slide deck
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
but but when you get to the right point
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
i'd really like to understand how those
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
concepts uh that your program and those
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
concepts fit together
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
so if i think if i could digress and
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
answer that question directly now
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's all right new hampshire has what
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
is described as a 1915
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
b waiver which is a
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
waiver that allows the state to as far
 
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.270 align:start position:0%
waiver that allows the state to as far
as

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
if you will acute care services like
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
hospitalization prescription drugs
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
your typical health insurance bundle is
 
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:10.789 align:start position:0%
your typical health insurance bundle is
nearly

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
nearly
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
all of our enrollment the 215
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
000 i was talking about are in managed
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
care we have what we call next day
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
enrollment so when someone gains
 
00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
eligibility they
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
go right into a managed care or the mcos
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
and so um in terms of the
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
services that would represent health
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
insurance as you typically would think
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
they're mostly nearly the entire
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
population is and those that
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
are not are usually in it only
 
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.870 align:start position:0%
are not are usually in it only
temporarily

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
temporarily
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
not in it temporarily excuse me there
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
are other waivers that
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
um you'll hear i think ltss is later on
 
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.029 align:start position:0%
um you'll hear i think ltss is later on
today

00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
which aspects of that are outside of the
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
managed care program
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
most notably things like the home and
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
community based waivers and
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully that gives you at least a
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of an introduction in terms
 
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.029 align:start position:0%
little bit of an introduction in terms
of

00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
and so we'll be covering a little bit um
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
more about the different services that
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
are mandatory and optional
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
later on the presentation um also
 
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
the key thing in terms of how much does

the federal government
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
finance the sometimes we described as
 
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.230 align:start position:0%
finance the sometimes we described as
the

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
fmap federal matching assistance
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
percentage and sometimes you'll hear it
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
with another acronym but basically it's
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
how does the federal government
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
participate and offering in it
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
and for new hampshire it's always at
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
least 50 percent and
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
we'll get into that a little bit more
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
later on as well
 
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
as part of the family's first coroner's
 
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.270 align:start position:0%
as part of the family's first coroner's
virus

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
response act the public health emergency
 
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
from a medicaid standpoint
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
offered states and i know of no state
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
that has
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
declined this if you maintain continuous
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
enrollment during the public health
 
00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:05.110 align:start position:0%
enrollment during the public health
emergency

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
that the state is eligible for enhanced
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
federal matching percentage on the
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
standard population
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
there's basically the the adults and
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
in that category it's 6.2 it's about
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
four and a half percent
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
in the what we call the children's group
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
or chip sometimes
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
and then for the the granite advantage
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
program which is the medicaid expansion
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
there is no enhancement because the
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
federal match is
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
already at 90
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
and this enhanced match goes through the
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
quarter ending
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
um which the public health emergency
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
ends and we talk about public health
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
emergency we're talking about
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
so i thought might be helpful to have
 
00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
some comparisons
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
out there in terms of how does the
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
federal landscape look
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
like compared to new hampshire
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
and let me see if i can make this a
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
so just in terms of the percent of
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
population covered is sort of
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
the top federally
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
u.s wise 28 of the population
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
is low income and 21 of the population
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
is covered by
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
medicaid or the children's health
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
insurance program
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we we don't have a
 
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.390 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we we don't have a
separate

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
children's health insurance program
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes known as chip it's all part of
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
our medicaid program
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire by contrast 16 of the
 
00:21:43.039 --> 00:21:43.850 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire by contrast 16 of the
population

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:44.950 align:start position:0%
population
[Music]

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
is considered low income 14 are
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of new hampshire being an
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
expansion state the granite advantage
 
00:21:58.559 --> 00:21:59.190 align:start position:0%
expansion state the granite advantage
program

00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
and these statistics go back to 2018-19
 
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.190 align:start position:0%
and these statistics go back to 2018-19
period

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
just before the public health emergency
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
the most
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
recent number would have been 51 000
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
comparatively in terms of the number of
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
people are covered
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
in the adult expansion group and there
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
are now uh 39 states that have adopted
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
and i have a slide later on
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
that will also give you a sense of
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
of those orange states here which ones
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
are moving towards
 
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
offering expansion i'd also note that
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill that was passed by the u.s
 
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.950 align:start position:0%
in the bill that was passed by the u.s
senate

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
there are incentives for those orange
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
states to
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
adopt expansion as well in terms of who
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
medicaid covers i just thought it was
 
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
kind of interesting that
 
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of adults aged 19 to 64.
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
nationally it's one in seven in new
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire it's one in ten
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
for children um it's two and five
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
um about sixty percent uh
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it's uh one and three
 
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.510 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it's uh one and three
um

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
a third excuse me two and fives forty
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
percent one in three
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
thirty three percent um in terms of
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
nursing home it's uh five and eight um
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
and a national level
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
about sixty percent and in new hampshire
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
it's about two-thirds 66 percent that
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
are covered
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
individuals with disability we cover one
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
in four nationally it's one in three
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
and in terms of the total
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
population of medicare
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
individuals who also have medicaid as
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
sort of a secondary
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
um nationally it's one in five in new
 
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:41.990 align:start position:0%
um nationally it's one in five in new
hampshire

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's one in eight down the bottom of
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
this chart
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
is in the eligibility
 
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
levels you'll see that new hampshire um
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
compared to the nation has eligibility
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's basically comparable
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
in every category except for children we
 
00:23:58.799 --> 00:23:59.590 align:start position:0%
in every category except for children we
cover

00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
cover
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit greater number of children
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
but as a percent of the population that
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
are children we actually cover
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
cover less compared than nationally
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
moving to the next slide the top part of
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
this slide is just
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
you know where does the money get spent
 
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.310 align:start position:0%
you know where does the money get spent
and

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:20.790 align:start position:0%
while adults and children
 
00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.149 align:start position:0%
while adults and children
[Music]

00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
represent the largest part of the
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
population it's the elderly and disabled
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
which account for the greatest part of
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
the expenditures and
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
nationally it's uh 23 are elderly and
 
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.470 align:start position:0%
nationally it's uh 23 are elderly and
disabled

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
disabled
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
um and they account for 61 percent of
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
the expenditures
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire historically it spends
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
20 percent
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
a little even disabled in 59
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
of the expenditures and um
 
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
when it's all said and done um you know
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
spends about one in six dollars in the
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
health care system as is done
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
nationally and about one in two dollars
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
are going to support
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
long-term care services and there's a
 
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
chart on the right here that kind of
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
breaks it down but largely
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire spending um follows i
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
think our demographics we have
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
more elderly and
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
disabled an older population and
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
but even with that it still tracks very
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
much the national
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
scene um we'll talk a little bit
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
um in the presentation about different
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
eligibility groups
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
this lodged is the one way of looking at
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
it in terms of
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
from a low income individuals with
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities and elderly individuals
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
and then the next slide is basically
 
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.350 align:start position:0%
and then the next slide is basically
where

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
expansion stands at the moment
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
there are now 39 states plus dc that
 
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.190 align:start position:0%
there are now 39 states plus dc that
have

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
adopted medicaid expansion um
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
and there are two additional states
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
missouri and oklahoma that are in the
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
process of
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
i sort of uh touched on this chart um
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
a week earlier than the updated numbers
 
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
i gave you but this is how
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
in the department level we've been
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
tracking um what's been going on since
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
the start of the public health emergency
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
and again i won't read off all these
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
statistics but
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
you can see here that the darker red
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
areas are where we're seeing the greater
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
percentage increases and on the right
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
hand side
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
is the percent change and the number of
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
so i noticed the bottom stat children's
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
with disabilities in-home care
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
is it because of covid uh
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
clients don't want us in their homes or
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
do we have fewer workers willing to go
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
into homes and therefore
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
were we were in decline in terms of the
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
numbers served
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
um i think it could be that um within
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
on the medicaid program people's
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
eligibility can change within different
 
00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
um uh groupings it may be that they
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
moved to it
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
they may have aged out of one group and
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
went into another um it may be that they
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
fell into another area but it's if we're
 
00:27:18.399 --> 00:27:18.950 align:start position:0%
fell into another area but it's if we're
talking

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
about 50 children and you can see that
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
in other categories our low-income
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
chip non-chip children that which is the
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
lion's share
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
went up over almost over
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
758 children and another
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
2 161 and low-income children
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
and it could be that um they either fell
 
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
into one of those groups or one of the
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
other disability groups that they aged
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
out of
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
can i ask a question to mr chairman oh
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks for saying something i
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
missed your hand uh
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative irv has a question could
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
you just clarify
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
the difference between low income and
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
medicaid chip
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
sure um if you remember one of the
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
earliest slides
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
there's um was a
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
showing where new hampshire compared to
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
the let me just go back to
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
that might make it easier to explain
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
if you remember looking at the um
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
children's eligibility level
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
here we're at 323 and um
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
nationally it's at 255. what this is
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
really representing
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
is that new hampshire adopted a number
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
of years back that
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
children who are 196 up to
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
i think it's 323 of poverty
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
um if you cover that 196 to 323 you get
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
an enhanced federal match
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
on those children and so that's what i
 
00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:56.950 align:start position:0%
on those children and so that's what i
think

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
you're seeing there is that uh the the
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
chip population is that group of
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
children that get the enhanced match
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
because they're in a higher
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
income um category does that answer your
 
00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:09.269 align:start position:0%
income um category does that answer your
question

00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
representative so it's an age thing it's
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
um it's not an age it's a
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's an income thing for children yes if
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
their family income is a little bit
 
00:29:17.679 --> 00:29:18.549 align:start position:0%
their family income is a little bit
higher

00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
higher
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
again um the federal government was
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
trying to provide states with an
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
incentive to cover more children
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
and certain states do and and new
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
hampshire is one of them
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
one of the other things i thought you
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
might find interesting um
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
is kind of how geographically the growth
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
and enrollment has transpired and
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
we've broken into three um groups here
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
the granite advantage
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
which is basically only an income based
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh people that are
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
100 less than 138 percent of the poverty
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
um animal and are typically childless
 
00:29:56.399 --> 00:29:58.310 align:start position:0%
um animal and are typically childless
adults

00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
adults
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
you can see that the growth
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
you know followed i think if you kind of
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
it spread around the state kind of you
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
know the portsmouth
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
area the rockingham county and over in
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
grafton county and carroll county are
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
some of the higher spots but it's pretty
 
00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:18.389 align:start position:0%
some of the higher spots but it's pretty
universally

00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
universally
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
important to a large group of
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
individuals to
 
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh have gained coverage through um
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
through this program i think a lot of
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
your um
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
your hospitality your restaurant um
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
individuals who may have lost their
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage or lost income became
 
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.990 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage or lost income became
eligible

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
and were able to be picked up um as i
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
it's over 21 000 individuals have
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
picked up coverage since the
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
mid-march time frame the standard
 
00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:51.590 align:start position:0%
mid-march time frame the standard
program

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
which is more categorically
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh driven you can see that the growth
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
rate there
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
hasn't been as high but again
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
if you look across the state there's you
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
know it tends to follow a somewhat
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
similar pattern as a
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
granted advantage as people um lose
 
00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.750 align:start position:0%
granted advantage as people um lose
income

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
and then the disabled population
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
again people aging into it a little bit
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
lower growth but also an important
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
um important aspect of being able to
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
provide coverage to those individuals
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
and again this has not been a
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
an economic hit that's just been
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
do you have another question there
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative earth
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
i do thank you mr gentleman so just to
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
clarify for my own
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
sake the grant advantage has expanded
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
medicaid medicaid expansion yes
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
and the standard income base is the
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
children's 9010 match
 
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
it would be it could be um anyone who is
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
in the categorical areas it could be
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
other than the blind and disabled um and
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
and elderly it's the other other groups
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
of standard coverage a lot of this could
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
be children
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
yep well where's the chip that the
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
medicaid chip piece falls
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
they would be in this they'd be in this
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
category as well okay so one of several
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
groups in that category
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
yep all right thank you are there any
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
you're free to continue okay so i know
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
um from sitting into
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
division three in the prior budget
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
and in this one that understanding not
 
00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:37.909 align:start position:0%
and in this one that understanding not
just

00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
the financial numbers but what's being
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
done to improve the program
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
is important so the next number of
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
slides are about what we're doing
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
and quality and um developing
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
the efficiency and effectiveness of the
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
program and
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
i'm going to invite patrick if you could
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
patrick mcgowan who is the administrator
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
of our medicaid
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
quality metrics if you could
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
come in and talk to a few of these
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
sure absolutely and uh thank you for the
 
00:33:09.919 --> 00:33:10.870 align:start position:0%
sure absolutely and uh thank you for the
opportunity

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
um so this slide here um
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
highlights uh sort of the core goals of
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
our medicaid
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
quality strategy which is required by
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
the centers for medicaid and medicare
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
services when you have managed care
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
these are sort of the high level six
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
goals that we have
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
first starting and i think we give a
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
link at some point that
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
will go to the full quality strategy
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
that you can read
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
but this was more for uh sort of the
 
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.230 align:start position:0%
but this was more for uh sort of the
highlights

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
highlights
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
um so the first one in upper left-hand
 
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
corner is to assure delivery of quality
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
and appropriateness of care
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
so this is the section where we do have
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
quality measures that look
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
and monitor our members getting
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
preventative care
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
or actual evidence-based treatment being
 
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:05.029 align:start position:0%
or actual evidence-based treatment being
provided

00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh was there a question representative
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative or you got your
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
hand up oh sorry
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
sure i'm just not used to talking so
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
much without somebody
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
chiming in so anyway so then
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh below that um we look at assure
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
access to quality care
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
so whereas before we looked at the
 
00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:30.389 align:start position:0%
so whereas before we looked at the
actual

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
actual
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
the care that was being provided you
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
know well
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
child visits vaccinations sort of the
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
preventive care the next one looks at
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
are you actually able to access that
 
00:34:39.839 --> 00:34:40.710 align:start position:0%
are you actually able to access that
care

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
so for that we look at our managed care
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
organizations provider networks do they
 
00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.069 align:start position:0%
organizations provider networks do they
allow

00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
members to have the ability to travel
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
within a reasonable time to providers
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
offices and are there enough providers
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
in that managed care organization's
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
network of providers
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
that would allow them to have all the
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
services that a typical member could
 
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.430 align:start position:0%
services that a typical member could
need

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
we also look at utilization data
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
to look at trends as far as how members
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
are accessing services to monitor to see
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
if there was change at all
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
which could indicate uh
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
changes in service patterns might mean
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
that there there could be an issue with
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
members accessing care and then we also
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
do look at
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh member grievances which is a
 
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:29.990 align:start position:0%
uh member grievances which is a
sustained

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
sustained
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
um filed complaint to the managed care
 
00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.230 align:start position:0%
um filed complaint to the managed care
organizations

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
we do look at appeals when services are
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
being denied if members or providers on
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
behalf of the member are reaching out to
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
file that the mco reconsider the action
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
those can all be indications of an
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
access to care
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
of members accessing care and then
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
finally we
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
also do have a member experience of care
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
surveys where we get
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
details back about how members have um
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
if they're getting the care that they
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
need really in the time that seems
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable to them
 
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
and a lot of these are all really any
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
industry standard
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
quality measures that we're using
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
below that we have a sure vendor
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
contract compliance we'll talk about an
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
external quality review organization
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
that we have in a few slides
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
but we do do a annual
 
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
audit of the mcos based
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
on their contract with the state and
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
particularly to see if they have
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
policies or procedures that are in place
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
in all areas of the contract
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
we also do have the ability to enforce
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
liquidated damages we have some internal
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
reports that we do calculate for the
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
medicaid director to see on a regular
 
00:36:45.839 --> 00:36:46.550 align:start position:0%
medicaid director to see on a regular
basis

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
how those managed care organizations are
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
complying with the contract
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
then we move up to the upper right hand
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
box which is manage continuous
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
performance improvement
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
this gets more into the areas of okay we
 
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.510 align:start position:0%
this gets more into the areas of okay we
see

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
rates that or quality measures where we
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
think should things should be better
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
what do we do about it
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
well we do have a quality withhold an
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
incentive program where we do withhold a
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
percentage of the mcos
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
what we call capitation rates and
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
we set goals in particular quality
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
measures and if the mcos can meet those
 
00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:23.990 align:start position:0%
measures and if the mcos can meet those
goals

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
goals
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
then they can get back um what was
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
the uh revenue that was withhold held
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
from them
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
there's also a component of that where
 
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
they could get a bonus
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
we also asked the mcos to do alternative
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
payment models with providers to where
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
they're incentivizing providers to reach
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
certain quality targets
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
um we have a few other programs as well
 
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:48.630 align:start position:0%
um we have a few other programs as well
including

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
our performance based auto assignment
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
program so mcos that score higher on
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
quality metrics
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
they can actually receive more members
 
00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.750 align:start position:0%
they can actually receive more members
that

00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
didn't actively choose a plan when they
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
are determined eligible for medicaid and
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
they could be assigned to
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
that plan um and then we have just
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
general performance improvement projects
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
that we do
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
um target population health activities
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
is the next quality of the quality
 
00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.829 align:start position:0%
is the next quality of the quality
strategy

00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
and to those that's where we have
 
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
particular populations that are
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
priorities in new hampshire
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
particularly those with mental health
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
substance use
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
or misuse some of the special needs
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
members that henry's already talked
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
about particularly with children
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
foster care children um and then
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh also looking at disparities as well
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
and then the final gallon oh sir yeah i
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
wanted i'm sorry
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh i under a managed care model my
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
simple understanding is
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
that other than uh the
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
assuring vendor contract compliance
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
that the contract has the mco
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
doing most of the other five boxes and
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
so i'm just curious
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
where our value add is relative to
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
uh just adding layers of management
 
00:39:12.839 --> 00:39:14.069 align:start position:0%
uh just adding layers of management
redundancy

00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
redundancy
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
can you actually if i could uh
 
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.910 align:start position:0%
can you actually if i could uh
representative

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh there are i think all the boxes that
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
are here are requirements of
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
the state in terms of overseeing if you
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
will it's contractors there
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
are pieces that uh the mcos
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
do of all of these areas but in terms of
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
um if you kind of think of it as uh sort
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
clerk of the works in a construction
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
project making sure that the
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
construction's actually completed to
 
00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.790 align:start position:0%
construction's actually completed to
specifications

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
specifications
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
we're we have a small group of
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
individuals that
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that uh that all that happens
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
we also are involved in setting the
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
goals based on
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
reviewing um the data on the metrics to
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
the areas where the mcos are focusing on
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
are ones that fit the
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
state's priorities um
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's a little bit helpful
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
and we can maybe as we jump into a few
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
other slides it might become a little
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
more apparent what
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
what we're doing and versus what we have
 
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:15.910 align:start position:0%
what we're doing and versus what we have
to

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
have independent third parties by
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
regulation do
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
as well so as you were talking i was
 
00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.109 align:start position:0%
as well so as you were talking i was
thinking

00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
what kind of external benchmarks are
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
there to determine how large
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
staff the state should have to oversee
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
these contracts whether it's a
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
purely judgment or if there's some
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
benchmark that we're
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
looking at and considering uh well i can
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
wait to the resourcing part of this
 
00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:41.510 align:start position:0%
wait to the resourcing part of this
though

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
sure um patrick are you ready for the
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
next slide
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely so
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
so here um this is one value add we do
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
provide for members
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
using a lot of our quality metrics we do
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
have a consumer guide
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
that members who have recently
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
determined eligible
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
or during an open enrollment period have
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
to pick a managed care organization
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
it's a two sheeter you're seeing uh on
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
this slide
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
one page but this link will bring you to
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
the actual guide
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
our vision was for members kind of like
 
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
when you're making a purchase
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
on amazon that you can see how the
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
health plans are rated in various
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
quality measures
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
and we tried to do a broad list of them
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
both children's measures overall
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
satisfaction with the health plan
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
well child visits to members how the
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
plans do for those
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
and then managing some chronic
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
conditions such as asthma
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
heart disease blood pressure all of
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
those i think are on the second page
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
we also compare the health plans to the
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
national medicaid average so there's
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
some benchmark that they're hanging on
 
00:41:53.839 --> 00:41:54.630 align:start position:0%
some benchmark that they're hanging on
to

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
these are all driven by quality measures
 
00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.829 align:start position:0%
these are all driven by quality measures
that

00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
you may have heard the acronym hedis
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
before but they're an industry
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
standard the acronym is probably less
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
relevant than what it
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
actually stands for but it is sort of
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
the industry standard on how
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
health plans are evaluated both for
 
00:42:15.359 --> 00:42:16.069 align:start position:0%
health plans are evaluated both for
clinical

00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
clinical
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
and uh ambulatory uh metrics
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
any questions about this patrick i just
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
add that for example on the top measure
 
00:42:25.119 --> 00:42:25.670 align:start position:0%
add that for example on the top measure
that

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
that can change year between year the
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
prior year would have flipped in terms
 
00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.470 align:start position:0%
prior year would have flipped in terms
of

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
um one plan being ahead of another we
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
have a third plan now
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
which they have to have a certain amount
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
of experience before you can
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
include them in this measure but um
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
patrick i just want to confirm is the
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
top line is their
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
their national uh uh evaluation not just
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire correct
 
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
i know that is the new hampshire
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation okay
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
um we're ready uh go to another slide
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
if there's no questions yes
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
um here are them we just wanted to give
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
you a little flavor for some of the key
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
performance indicators of how we
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
evaluate the plans
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
so you'll see one two three four five
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
different metrics that we look at we do
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
have over 200 metrics that we're
 
00:43:14.319 --> 00:43:16.069 align:start position:0%
have over 200 metrics that we're
evaluating

00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
evaluating
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
at different periodicities here you'll
 
00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.190 align:start position:0%
at different periodicities here you'll
see

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
the i think the dark blue
 
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
is the new hampshire medicaid managed
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
care rate that's the total program rate
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
and then the kind of more turquoise
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
color we're actually able to calculate
 
00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.230 align:start position:0%
color we're actually able to calculate
what

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire commercial payers have
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
scored on the same rate
 
00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
and then we also add the national
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid average for context
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
the licensing on that data prevents us
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
from actually
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
publicly sharing um the rates so that's
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
why you'll just see a bar
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
but no value above it so and then some
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
measures you'll see well child visits
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
in the first 15 months of life breast
 
00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.230 align:start position:0%
in the first 15 months of life breast
cancer

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.109 align:start position:0%

00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
measures
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
of receiving follow-up care after
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
emergency department visits for mental
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
illness or substance use
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
typically in most of our quality
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
measures we do tend to score
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
higher in new hampshire than the
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
national average
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
but it's nice to see the commercial
 
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
perspective to where you can start to
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
see how we fare against
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
other products in new hampshire or other
 
00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.510 align:start position:0%
other products in new hampshire or other
populations

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
populations
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
i have a couple questions about this
 
00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.710 align:start position:0%
i have a couple questions about this
slide

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
at what age does the program begin
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
breast cancer cancer screening
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
um off the top of my head i don't have
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
it i can get it for you though
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
okay and the reason i asked that is
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
because the literature was bouncing all
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
around for a while
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
on what the right age is for women to
 
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
begin uh regular mammograms and so i'm
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
just curious
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
um how how that settled down and if
 
00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.670 align:start position:0%
um how how that settled down and if
we're

00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
complying with it then the other one
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
that i'm curious about is um
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
i see the follow-up visit after
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
emergency room visits for mental illness
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
and then for substance abuse
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
and the substance abuse is obviously
 
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.670 align:start position:0%
and the substance abuse is obviously
substantially

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
substantially
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
lower does that imply that it's
 
00:45:20.319 --> 00:45:21.349 align:start position:0%
lower does that imply that it's
substantially

00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
substantially
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
harder to go do a follow-up for
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
i think the new hampshire data would
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
show that i mean this is a measure that
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
it's kind of ironic because new
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire scores better we're probably
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
about top in the nation
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
for this measure but it's still a rate
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
that we believe is unacceptable
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
um so comparatively is it easier
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
than mental health um i don't know henry
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
can't speak to that but the data would
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
suggest the opposite that it's easier to
 
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
do a mental health follow
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
oh that's what i meant yeah yeah so
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
so then i guess i guess given that
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's just a clear
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
um observation from the data
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
what what do we need to do differently
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
to get that 27
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
at least twice as high so if i could
 
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
patrick i think that we
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
look at it from a number of different
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
angles i think patrick talked
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
earlier about um the
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
programs that we ask the mcos to
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
consider in terms of apms or
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
ways of developing value-based care
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
we've asked the mcos to develop
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
relationships to improve uh that
 
00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.230 align:start position:0%
relationships to improve uh that
follow-up

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
with providers we've um they have
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
requirements in the contract to do
 
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
performance improvement
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh programs in addition to that
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
as well as in our uh withhold measures
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
um incentives we include it there so
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
we're trying to come at it from
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
um a number of different angles and as
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
patrick said well we may be doing
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
very well comparatively it to the to the
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
nation it's a number that
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
we obviously want to have much higher
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
particularly where new hampshire has
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
been one of the higher states affected
 
00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.990 align:start position:0%
been one of the higher states affected
by

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
the sud crisis
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
we also do have some process measures as
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
well uh chairman edwards that um
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
as far as how when members are
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
discharged from the ed
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh the mco is required to make several
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
contact attempts for each of those
 
00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.150 align:start position:0%
contact attempts for each of those
members

00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
so we do track that as well um
 
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
so it certainly is not a measure that
 
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't have multiple quality
 
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
initiatives attached to it so
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
i think it's probably one of the areas
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
between mental health and
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
where we're spending a lot of time
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
come from all different angles to to
 
00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:57.990 align:start position:0%
come from all different angles to to
improve

00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
improve
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
the delivery of care and the breast
 
00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:02.390 align:start position:0%
the delivery of care and the breast
cancer

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
oh sorry just so you know my frustration
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
with that answer
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
is i'm i'm and i'm sorry
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
i may be just a little impatient today
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
but i'm just hearing
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
that we're going to require more
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
planning more documentation more
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
conversation at the staff level
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
but fundamentally we don't know exactly
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
who needs to do what to get that number
 
00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.230 align:start position:0%
who needs to do what to get that number
higher

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
higher
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
no i don't think that that would be
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
accurate representative i think that
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
we have specific measures built into the
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
contract in terms of performance metrics
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
that require for example
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
um and we measure them in terms of the
 
00:48:39.599 --> 00:48:40.790 align:start position:0%
um and we measure them in terms of the
mcos

00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
mcos
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
are they in fact um making those
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
contacts have they at least made the
 
00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:45.910 align:start position:0%
contacts have they at least made the
attempts

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
attempts
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
um and so i think one what i was trying
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
to say is that
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
rather than just looking at one place in
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
the contract where we can try to
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
improve uh this measure we're
 
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
looking at it from a variety of
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
different angles and trying to
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
raise that measure up and so i guess i
 
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
would say that it's
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's not redundant it's complementary
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's trying to
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
um weave together a series of aspects of
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
the contract
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
to improve that measure
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you sir um and just add uh
 
00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.109 align:start position:0%
thank you sir um and just add uh
representative

00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
edwards um we did actually see an
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
increase in this measure from the prior
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
year of about six percent
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
so and which would i think complement
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
when we started to place a greater
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
focus on it certainly is not where it
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
needs to be well we are seeing the right
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
directionality that we're looking for
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
thank you um are you ready for the next
 
00:49:42.839 --> 00:49:44.069 align:start position:0%
thank you um are you ready for the next
slide

00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
yes are you okay with the move ahead um
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
oh yeah no i'll keep interrupting if i
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
have more questions
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
no please um and the breast cancer
 
00:49:53.359 --> 00:49:53.990 align:start position:0%
no please um and the breast cancer
screening

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
screening
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
um just so you know for that that is
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh we're hedis uses percentage of women
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
so there's not a set age it's a it's a
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
range and then they choose the range
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
other uh diagnostic characteristics of
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
the patient
 
00:50:20.549 --> 00:50:20.559 align:start position:0%
i'm i i was expecting there to be an
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
age one age where breast screening
 
00:50:23.839 --> 00:50:25.030 align:start position:0%
age one age where breast screening
begins

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
begins
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
at 50 i think is what patrick was yeah
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
50 to 74.
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
oh so we kind of stopped at age 74.
 
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.750 align:start position:0%
oh so we kind of stopped at age 74.
correct

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay that no i i know and then is that
 
00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.430 align:start position:0%
okay that no i i know and then is that
uh

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
once every two years three years what's
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
what's the frequency once a woman gets
 
00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.309 align:start position:0%
what's the frequency once a woman gets
started

00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
so it's following the us prevention task
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
receive a mammogram every two years
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
can you see the next slide yes
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely so um
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
we showed you sort of some of the key uh
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
key performance indicators that we do
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
when we did the quality strategy
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
updated our quality strategy we did
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
you see we compare a lot against the
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
national average
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
where our desire is to kind of start
 
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.829 align:start position:0%
where our desire is to kind of start
comparing

00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
comparing
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire against a higher bar new
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
england tends to be a healthier
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
so we've started to look at how does new
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire compare in our rates
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
not only against the national average
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
but against the 75th
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
percentile of medicaid uh
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
care plans in the state so in doing this
 
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:48.309 align:start position:0%
care plans in the state so in doing this
we

00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
um got together a group internally
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
and found 10 measures where we were
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
actually below the 75th percentile and
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
those were going to be some of our focus
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
areas over the next three years
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
to raise up to the 75th percentile
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
and the where we look at those as we
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
look at those in areas of prevention and
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
treatment you'll see some of the
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
categories here some
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
we've talked about before adolescent
 
00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
health women's health
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
adult mental health children's mental
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
health substance use disorder and uh
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
one measure as well of appropriate care
 
00:52:19.839 --> 00:52:20.230 align:start position:0%
one measure as well of appropriate care
so

00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh the link here goes to kind of that
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
report we'll kind of tell you a little
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
bit more in depth of the different
 
00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:26.710 align:start position:0%
bit more in depth of the different
measures

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
measures
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
but also how we've um
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
fared we have a after a year and a half
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
of doing this work
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
um henry do you want to jump to the
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
results of that so we're on topic it's
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
the slide and then we'll come back to
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
the external quality review organization
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
all right so what we have here is we've
 
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
given you sort of where new hampshire is
 
00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
in the baseline which is the column nhcy
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
2018 and i see why we mean uh calendar
 
00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:57.230 align:start position:0%
2018 and i see why we mean uh calendar
year

00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
2018 goes different than
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
the state fiscal year and then after
 
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:03.990 align:start position:0%
the state fiscal year and then after
publishing

00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
publishing
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
um those 10 priority quality improvement
 
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.150 align:start position:0%
um those 10 priority quality improvement
priority

00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
priority
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
areas we have um an update of calendar
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
year 2019
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
how we've done and then we have a color
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
coding here which will show you
 
00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:20.839 align:start position:0%
a range particularly in calendar year
 
00:53:20.839 --> 00:53:21.990 align:start position:0%
a range particularly in calendar year
2019

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
2019
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
how those results are red meaning
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
still below the 75th percentile but also
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
below the 50th percentile as well
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
areas probably would need more focus
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
yellow being
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
that the performance was still below the
 
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
75th but we are larger we are higher
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
than the national average at this point
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
um the lighter green being that
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
we had improvement from the prior year
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
but we're still below the 75th
 
00:53:47.839 --> 00:53:48.950 align:start position:0%
but we're still below the 75th
percentile

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
percentile
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
and then the darkest green meaning we've
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
sort of achieved that goal
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
so you see the majority of the
 
00:53:55.359 --> 00:53:56.150 align:start position:0%
so you see the majority of the
categories

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
categories
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
there's ten of them we're showing you
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
five here um
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
have uh the light green where um
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
in the prior slide where uh we've
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
we're improving but not at the target
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
yet this
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
and then the next one shows that of
 
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.069 align:start position:0%
and then the next one shows that of
these

00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
almost all of them are at the 75th
 
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
percentile with one
 
00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
um being still below the 75th and the
 
00:54:19.359 --> 00:54:20.390 align:start position:0%
um being still below the 75th and the
50th

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
50th
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
so that's a lot of information at once
 
00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:23.990 align:start position:0%
so that's a lot of information at once
um

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
kind of the color coding helps a lot so
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
if we could go back to the previous
 
00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.190 align:start position:0%
if we could go back to the previous
slide

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
sure okay so i think the color code is
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
often a couple of these boxes if i if
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
i'm reading your key correctly
 
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
um but let's talk about um immunizations
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh two things is is the hpv
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
via a vaccine is is that settled science
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
now where
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh people think it's really a good idea
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's been out for about 20 years dude
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
are we are we confident that's a good
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
thing to be given kids
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
i think in terms of our measurement
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
we're following um the national
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
committee for equality
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not talking about measurement i'm
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
talking about whether the hpv
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
is good medicine are we convinced it's
 
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
good medicine
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
well i'm not a clinician um
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative edwards i think where we
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
do then the other question is
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
um on these immunizations the for
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
adolescents i
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
i thought the last time i looked at an
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
immunization schedule
 
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
it had i don't know 30
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
40 vaccines that were sort of
 
00:55:35.839 --> 00:55:37.190 align:start position:0%
40 vaccines that were sort of
recommended

00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
so what does it take to get a
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
a green in this area for a kid they have
 
00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
the most critical immunizations or the
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
whole panel
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
so we have two different um
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
populations for child and adolescent
 
00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:56.630 align:start position:0%
populations for child and adolescent
immunizations

00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
immunizations
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
one is focused on the younger children
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
and that may be what i think
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
perhaps what you're referencing that has
 
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
a far higher volume of
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
immunizations when you get to
 
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:08.559 align:start position:0%
adolescence it's really i think
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
three or four um and the most
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
challenging of those is the hpv
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
um vaccination i think it's still
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
open for debate where the challenges are
 
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
i think part of it is that it's a two
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
series set
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
and adolescent well visits what you have
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
adolescents that you just aren't going
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
to the doctor as much
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
as you were with children in their
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
earlier years but if you can see
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
the difference between these two
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
adolescent vaccination measures the
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
first one
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
when you don't include the hvv the rates
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
are far higher than when you actually do
 
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
include the hpv
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
so that first row you see has a 78.2
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
percent compliance rate
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
but then we drop down to 33.1 once we
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
start evaluating
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
members who also had the full hpv set so
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
if you had to say i think to your point
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
i think it's the hpv where we're we're
 
00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.990 align:start position:0%
i think it's the hpv where we're we're
struggling

00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
struggling
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
all right thank you i don't see any
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
questions from anyone else
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
so i would just add here representative
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
what we try to do is
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
you know as patrick talked about we're
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
looking at several
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
up to several hundred different measures
 
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
but we wanted to
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
um where we were not at the 75th
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
percentile of performance we wanted to
 
00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:26.470 align:start position:0%
percentile of performance we wanted to
identify

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
identify
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
ten things to focus on for uh several
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
years to raise them up and
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
you know we wanted to show you that
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
while there are
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
certain areas where we've made that
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
there are other areas where you're so
 
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
into it we still have more work to do
 
00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:41.030 align:start position:0%
into it we still have more work to do
and

00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
again i think you know there are many
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
good things to say about
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's medicaid quality but
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
there are areas where we need to improve
 
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
and we're
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
we're highlighting some of the
 
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
priorities here for you
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
i like that it's a huge program and and
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's a saying something like if you
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
don't measure it you're not going to fix
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
it so
 
00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
i'm glad that i'm glad you're doing this
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
and we you know we try to work with the
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
mcos to focus on this and all the
 
00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:06.549 align:start position:0%
mcos to focus on this and all the
different

00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:06.559 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
ways that the department is interacting
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
with the public on these areas we're
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
you know leverage focus on this
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
um so i think that's what we had for
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
quality and
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
like to now i think one part of the
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
slide deck we were asked to address were
 
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
sort of for
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
four areas where um we feel like we've
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
had some key accomplishments and i think
 
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
i'll start to drive again from here
 
00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
um so i think in terms of things that
 
00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:37.829 align:start position:0%
um so i think in terms of things that
we're

00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
sort of proud about from the division of
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
medicaid services
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
is uh over this past year certainly the
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
response to the public health emergency
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
uh the division of medicaid services has
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
played a key role in it
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
i talked about earlier during the public
 
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
health emergency if you
 
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
follow the maintenance of effort
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
requirements the state is eligible for
 
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
enhanced federal match
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
and you can see here for for state
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
that represented 22.8 million dollars
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
of additional funding and for state
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
21 i'm expecting that to be another 45
 
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
million i will stop here for a moment as
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
to just mention that
 
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.190 align:start position:0%
to just mention that
[Music]

00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
the the length of the public health
 
00:59:25.599 --> 00:59:27.430 align:start position:0%
the the length of the public health
emergency

00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
and has seemed
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
to have some different perspectives on
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
how long that would last when we
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
prepare the agency budget as an instance
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
we thought it would end
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
a lot earlier than it is you know we
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
didn't have the spike
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
that we saw um you know from the
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
thanksgiving period through
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
early february and then even
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
into the governor's phase of the budget
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's since i think the
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
the top end of the spike that the
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
federal government has anticipated based
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
on the rollout of vaccine
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
and the variance that
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
there's an expectation that the public
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
health emergency might last
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
as long as the end of the year calendar
 
01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.030 align:start position:0%
as long as the end of the year calendar
year

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
21 or maybe even longer and so as we
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
look at some of our numbers
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
as we move towards the the next phase of
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
the budget process there'll be some
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
updates to these numbers as we learn
 
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
more definitively how long things are
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
going to last in terms of the public
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
health emergency so i just
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
as we get into this later just i'll
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
repeat that i think again but
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
also at the beginning of the public
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
health emergency before provider relief
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
money became
 
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
available to to our medical community
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
we were concerned about the
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
sustainability of our safety net and we
 
01:00:51.359 --> 01:00:53.109 align:start position:0%
sustainability of our safety net and we
renegotiated

01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
renegotiated
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
the mco contract to not bring
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
not spend new money but money that was
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
already appropriate within the
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
capitation payments to
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
reallocate it to our safety net
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
providers because
 
01:01:07.829 --> 01:01:07.839 align:start position:0%
utilization of services were down um
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
and so that was i think an important
 
01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:11.450 align:start position:0%
early help to
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:13.109 align:start position:0%
early help to
[Music]

01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
safety net providers at qhcs um
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
in another way we were able to help the
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers home
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
health agencies
 
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
all of our what i'll call more
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
subsistence agencies
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of the provider relief funds
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
that did come
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
in the federal government depended on
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
state medicaid programs to provide
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
information so they could figure out how
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
to design it and it was quite a bit of
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
work that our
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
mmis team put together to make sure that
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government had what they
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
needed to give new hampshire's fair
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
share of that allocation
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
um one of the big issues that we'll talk
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
about um
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
later on a little bit more is that while
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
we continue eligibility there'll be a
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
time when the
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
public health emergency ends and there
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
are issues in terms of
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
if you will flexibilities the state of
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was able to acquire
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
through waiver
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
as well as eligibility that we'll have
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
to work through all that
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
and um that's uh we've been
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
if you will standing up all the things
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
that the opportunities that made sense
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
and at some point we'll need to also
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
unwind those things and so we've been
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
involved in standing up and planning for
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
the ultimate end um
 
01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
am i interpreting that bullet correctly
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
to think that there may be some
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
providers that will be disenrolled
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
no this when we're talking about
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
provider enrollment here for example at
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
the very beginning of the
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
public health emergency if you remember
 
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
the there was an executive order around
 
01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.309 align:start position:0%
the there was an executive order around
telemedicine

01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
telemedicine
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
and for example new hampshire depends a
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
lot on
 
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
say children's hospital um to
 
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:01.039 align:start position:0%
uh provide care for children for those
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
children in need but in terms of getting
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
them enrolled so they could
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
provide telemedicine services we were
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
get some flexibility to be able to
 
01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.950 align:start position:0%
get some flexibility to be able to
enroll

01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
enroll
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
if you will of the boston medical
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
community to be available
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
to provide telemedicine services if that
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
was needed
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
and so it allowed us to use if someone
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
was already enrolled in medicare
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
or in another state's medicaid program
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
we'd be able to accept that enrollment
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
that eligibility for enrollment
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
on a uh temporary basis during the
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative that's really great
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
it it triggers a few others but let's
 
01:03:43.599 --> 01:03:46.069 align:start position:0%
it it triggers a few others but let's
continue

01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
um 1135
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
is a section of the social security act
 
01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.470 align:start position:0%
is a section of the social security act
that

01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
deals with the waivers that typically
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
come into play
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
during a public health emergency and and
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
one that we
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
were able to help
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
some families there's been a real
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
shortage out there as you may have
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
followed the news
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
that um you know some of the people left
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
the workforce
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh for a variety of reasons
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of whether they be nurses or
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
or aids or what or lnas and
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
um family members who had to provide
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
care for
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
for children um in particular and adults
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
um that it was hard to get workforce
 
01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:31.750 align:start position:0%
um that it was hard to get workforce
they

01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
were concerned about bringing workforce
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
into their home
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
um what we've been able to do leverage
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
our existing 1135
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
waiver in personal care to allow us
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
where you can't get help is to
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
provide some compensation for families
 
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
to provide services that would otherwise
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
be delivered for example a family member
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
may be
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
involved in providing a service that
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
a home health agency may have been
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
providing earlier or
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
another agency that they just they can't
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
there's just no help
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
available and so this is providing
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
for a certain number of families some
 
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
temporary relief this
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
this flexibility will go away after the
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
public health emergency but one of the
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
things i think from a public policy
 
01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.870 align:start position:0%
things i think from a public policy
standpoint

01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
is that um after the public health
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
emergency is over
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
that our workforce um whether it be
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
nursing homes or hospitals or
 
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
or home care there's been a reduction uh
 
01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:32.799 align:start position:0%
due to
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
people leaving the workforce and also
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
the effect that
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
education programs um you know training
 
01:05:39.119 --> 01:05:40.069 align:start position:0%
education programs um you know training
people

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
that that we've we've lost some
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
workforce here and we're
 
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
trying to work to see what flexibilities
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
in the long term we'll be able to maybe
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
bring to bear to
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
help deal with what i think is going to
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
be an upcoming uh
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
shortage that will be very difficult to
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
work for when meeting people's needs
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
so expand on that word flexibilities
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
what are you thinking
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
give me give me a couple of examples of
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
what flexibility do you think we might
 
01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.589 align:start position:0%
what flexibility do you think we might
need

01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:10.820 align:start position:0%
so as an example today for
 
01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.950 align:start position:0%
so as an example today for
[Music]

01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
private duty nursing that we provide for
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
someone who might get be
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know a severely disabled child at
 
01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.309 align:start position:0%
you know a severely disabled child at
home

01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
that there just aren't nurses available
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
through agencies sometimes to do that
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
and in some states for example they
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
allow individual nurses who get enrolled
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
in the program to be able to provide
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
those services so it's basically
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
opening up what might be
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
available in terms of nursing coverage
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
that some people don't necessarily want
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
to work for an agency
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
and so we're looking at that option
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
we're also
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
looking at seeing if the federal
 
01:06:57.359 --> 01:06:58.630 align:start position:0%
looking at seeing if the federal
government

01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
will work with us on um extending this
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
personal care
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity um and when i say um
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
this opportunity it's not just the
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly thing that the individual
 
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
has to go through a
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
criminal background check and and
 
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
training and be seen to be
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
um capable of of delivering that
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
personal care
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
but is there a way outside of the 1135
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
authority which ends the day of the
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
end of the public health emergency that
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
we can structure some things but
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's kind of looking at um you know
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
we have um as you can see sort of
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
in the area of telemedicine we've opened
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
up a lot more avenues for
 
01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
for care to be delivered and you know
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
taking out some of the
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
the time to get to people i think we
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
need to look at how we can expand the
 
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
existing workforce's ability to
 
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
to meet our beneficiaries needs and i
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh we're also looking at nurse
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
delegation under
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
under and that may require us to work
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
with the office of professional
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
licensure in terms of
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
you know can individuals who have
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
received trainings for example
 
01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
um you know like trait care as an
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
example is that
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
something that would be able to be with
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
a certain uh
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
supervision and sign off be something
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
that someone could specialize in
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
as opposed to having to rely on a
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
certain level of licensure to do that
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
these are types of things that we're
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
we're looking into
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
because we know that there's going to be
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
an increasing shortage that
 
01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:33.759 align:start position:0%
there are people who you know are not
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
able to get all of the
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
the care that's assessed to be needed
 
01:08:37.839 --> 01:08:39.110 align:start position:0%
the care that's assessed to be needed
and

01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to figure out ways to
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
be creative to work around that
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
so i assume your internal procedure is
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
that when you come up with flexibility
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
ideas that require
 
01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
you figure out if a new hampshire
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
statute needs to be modified and
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
in which case you work with mr williams
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
who then in turn works with the senator
 
01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:00.309 align:start position:0%
who then in turn works with the senator
house

01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
hhs is that your normal process
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
yes and also with other um bodies
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
you know a good example of that is what
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
we will talk a little bit about
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
later is the in the medicaid schools
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
area in terms of trying to get
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
um last session just before the pandemic
 
01:09:25.969 --> 01:09:25.979 align:start position:0%
kicked in was senate bill 684 which
 
01:09:25.979 --> 01:09:27.189 align:start position:0%
kicked in was senate bill 684 which
[Music]

01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
provided licensure for school
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
psychologists so that they could build
 
01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:33.669 align:start position:0%
psychologists so that they could build
medicaid

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
and also masters prepared people brought
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
them under the
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
so we do have to work with john as well
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
as other agencies
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
and the legislature of course as well
 
01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:54.070 align:start position:0%
and the legislature of course as well
yeah

01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
so in this budget do you have any uh
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
requests for funding to help with any of
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
these manpower flexibility
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
pilot projects or or if you had
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
a pilot project you wanted to try um
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
and you needed money where would you get
 
01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.950 align:start position:0%
and you needed money where would you get
it

01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
um i guess in terms of um if care is not
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
being delivered that
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
is been assessed as being needed that
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
that would create
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
some flexibility for us to um
 
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
be creative where we wouldn't need new
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
money to do something like that for
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
example if
 
01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:35.930 align:start position:0%
private duty nursing shortage
 
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:37.110 align:start position:0%
private duty nursing shortage
[Music]

01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
it would just basically moving from one
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
bucket to another some of the other
 
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
things that would require
 
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
legislative changes i think would
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
probably be things that we'd have to
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you we also
 
01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
took advantage of the federal government
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
provides states and the ability to
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
create a new
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
eligibility group um to do covid testing
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
the space basically provided 100
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
federal match and
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
you know early on in the pandemic in
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
terms of increasing our testing level so
 
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
we had some sense of
 
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.310 align:start position:0%
we had some sense of
[Music]

01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
what what the incidence of the disease
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
was in the state
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
that this was helpful to that today we
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
have just under 7
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
000 individuals who are in this
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
testing group this testing group would
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
end at the end of the public health
 
01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:36.709 align:start position:0%
end at the end of the public health
emergency

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
and there is federal legislation that
 
01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:40.950 align:start position:0%
and there is federal legislation that
may

01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
extend this for a longer period of time
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
we'll see
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
what comes out of the latest legislation
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
when it goes through the
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
this basically provided for testing and
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
some limited
 
01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
diagnostics around it to ascertain
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
and then we were also involved in the
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
execution of
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
the expanded telehealth from a medicaid
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
perspective in terms of getting
 
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
the executive order um implemented as
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
well as
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
working on the rules uh as they affect
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid with respect to legislation
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
that was passed
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
last session on telehealth who is the
 
01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:21.430 align:start position:0%
last session on telehealth who is the
lead

01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
lead
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
person in dhhs who's the most
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about
 
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
dhh efforts to support telehealth
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
so um dr ballad who's our medical
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
director is
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
um and uh jane hipps who heads our
 
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
medical unit of the two
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
individuals that are involved um
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
at a legislative level on the committees
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
working on the telehealth rule i think
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
dr ballard certainly
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
um from the physician perspective um
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of how it can be used um and uh
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
jane from
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
um basically the licensure and medicaid
 
01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.790 align:start position:0%
um basically the licensure and medicaid
rules

01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
could you show me their contact
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
very good so
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that the department
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
does is implement
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
legislative policy and federal
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
regulations and state regulations i've
 
01:13:24.159 --> 01:13:24.630 align:start position:0%
regulations and state regulations i've
talked

01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
talked
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
about the top bullet here which is the
 
01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
medicaid to schools
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
program which school psychologists was
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
most important things but there were
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
other aspects of that
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that helped speech uh speech
 
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.030 align:start position:0%
legislation that helped speech uh speech
therapy

01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
that helped administration medication in
 
01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:42.950 align:start position:0%
that helped administration medication in
schools

01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
we've also worked um you know
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
in hb4 in 2019 and adult dental benefit
 
01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
design was uh passed and then
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
there's been a legislation there's two
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
bills actively
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
being considered right now in terms of
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
financing an adult
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
dental benefit we work with a
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
and actuaries to to help shape and
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
design that
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
so so i want to stop and talk about this
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
a little bit more because
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
you you came in and you gave us a
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
special review of the dental program
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
and i got to tell you i forgot some of
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
the key stuff but
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
um i have an email from the governor's
 
01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:25.990 align:start position:0%
um i have an email from the governor's
office

01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
who who it makes it sound
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
like there is no dental care program
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
in medicaid in this budget at all
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
and that he cited that uh
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
that we that the governor vetoed hb 250
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
in 2020 which which would have
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
established the program
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
and so i what i'm confused about
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
is is there a legal authorized program
 
01:14:58.630 --> 01:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
or not it's a yes or no
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
yes and um
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
what's the source of the authority so
 
01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.510 align:start position:0%
what's the source of the authority so
hb4

01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
hb4
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
hb4 in 2019 the issue is is that while
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
there's a benefit there's not
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
adequate funding to to to to do so and
 
01:15:14.719 --> 01:15:15.990 align:start position:0%
adequate funding to to to to do so and
really

01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh 250 last year and the two bills
 
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
this year really about um you know
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
providing both the funding
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
and the benefit design that would be
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
more economical to implement i think the
 
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
governor vetoed
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
at 250 based on cost and the
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
the two bills have a more economical uh
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
approach to them than what was in 250
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
there's also to my understanding in the
 
01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:46.070 align:start position:0%
there's also to my understanding in the
senate

01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
a timing issue that's being looked at in
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
trying to minimize um
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
the cost in this upcoming biennium and
 
01:15:55.679 --> 01:15:56.390 align:start position:0%
the cost in this upcoming biennium and
to

01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
but to start the program and i i do i do
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know in the governor's
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
inaugural address he talked about this
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
as being an area that there might be
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to um
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
work with the legislature on i you know
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
from a standpoint of
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
of uh need the need is there i think you
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
know ultimately whether it goes forward
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
or not is a decision
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
of the legislature and the governor but
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
we've we have a requirement under hb4 to
 
01:16:25.679 --> 01:16:26.070 align:start position:0%
we've we have a requirement under hb4 to
be

01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm thinking about what you just said
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
there are two bills currently uh before
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
to take the authority of hb4
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
and to shape it a little further and to
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
fund it
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
is that is that accurate i think that's
 
01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:50.790 align:start position:0%
is that is that accurate i think that's
a

01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
fair overall assessment of it um there
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
may be other people like john williams
 
01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:55.590 align:start position:0%
may be other people like john williams
who

01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
could give you a more technical
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
explanation but i think that's a fair
 
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
characterization of it
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
okay so that would be another one of my
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
questions could you tell me
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
the two bill numbers so i can go look at
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
them and figure out
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
where it is in the committee process
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
please senate bill
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
um 150 which passed the commit
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
the health and human services committee
 
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
um unanimously
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that there's
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
that's the bill that is
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
considered a date further out i think
 
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
january of
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
22 beginning um which would change the
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
date that was in hb4 right
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
um and then there's uh house bill
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
i believe it's 103. um both those bills
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
are in hearings uh this week to my
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
understanding i also have dr finney if
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
you want to get into this a little bit
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
further who's i believe
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh um out there who could be brought in
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
to give you a little bit more update
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
than i
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
just did right now if you'd like that
 
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's sufficient i just
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
i just needed to be reminded of what i'd
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
forgotten and you did that
 
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you you also had sent something
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
kevin ripple i don't know kevin if uh if
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
that has been able to be distributed yet
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
i think it was just sent to you probably
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
the end of the week
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
just some notes from the meeting that we
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
did have
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
i think that exact document though on
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
our website hasn't been emailed out
 
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
although that information was contained
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
in a separate email i sent i had linked
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 103 or the senate bill 150
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note i'm not sure which so it
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
contained the same financial information
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
as in the document you emailed last week
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
good thank you um
 
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
so i think those two things give you uh
 
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
um the background that can be given i
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
think right now we're really
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
at the discretion of what the
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
legislature and the governor is willing
 
01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:51.110 align:start position:0%
legislature and the governor is willing
to

01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
willing to do in this area i think it's
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
generally good health care to take care
 
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:56.310 align:start position:0%
generally good health care to take care
of

01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
people's mouths and uh and that it saves
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
money in the long run
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
the issue is what's the right size i
 
01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:04.070 align:start position:0%
the issue is what's the right size i
think

01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:07.350 align:start position:0%
think
right

01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
another area that has to do with sort of
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
federal compliance
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
um the federal government
 
01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:17.330 align:start position:0%
uh asked the state to um
 
01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:18.790 align:start position:0%
uh asked the state to um
[Music]

01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
document beyond what's in statute how
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
the intergovernmental transfers
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
that fund the county cap um and
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
to to put that into sort of a a written
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
agreement form
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
and we were able to um
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
complete a document um that
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
addressed the federal government's uh
 
01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.149 align:start position:0%
addressed the federal government's uh
cons

01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
cons
 
01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
concerns to uh to put something into
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
writing beyond what's in our
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
state statutes we work with the
 
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
counties and coming up something that
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of state plan amendments
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of legislative activity
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
that came out of the last
 
01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
session probably double the amount of
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
state plan amendments that we had to
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
execute on
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
and we had to do that at a time of both
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
a public health emergency
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
as well as losing one of our key staff
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
who uh works in this role and so i'm
 
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:22.719 align:start position:0%
proud of the
 
01:20:24.629 --> 01:20:24.639 align:start position:0%
the team stepping up and making sure
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
that the work got done at a time
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
you know double the work with with a key
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
individual wasn't able to
 
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
to be there the whole time for us um we
 
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:34.629 align:start position:0%
to be there the whole time for us um we
also

01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
um to i'm sorry see representative eric
 
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
oh yeah he does go ahead thank you
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
mr chairman can we get a copy of the
 
01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
intercon governmental transfer agreement
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
you were referring to between the state
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
and the counties
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
and then the last two bullets on the
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
page are our policy that was
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
passed again a prior legislative session
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
implementing the medicaid for older
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
adults with disabilities and
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
and expanding the need these basically
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
are programs that help
 
01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities to be able to
 
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
participate in the workforce without
 
01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
losing benefits and
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
with as a result of earning some
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
additional income
 
01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
the benefits of being able to to be
 
01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:39.669 align:start position:0%
the benefits of being able to to be
engaged

01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
engaged
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
in your community without the risk of
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
of losing benefits with a little bit of
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
additional income is kind of the key
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
thing here
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
me just for people who are less than 64
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
and less
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
mode is for adults
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
greater in mead we also
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
updated the financial
 
01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:01.830 align:start position:0%
updated the financial
[Music]

01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements there and we'll
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
talk about a little bit that when we
 
01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
get into some of the prioritized needs
 
01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:09.270 align:start position:0%
get into some of the prioritized needs
that

01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
weren't necessarily funded in the budget
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
so far
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
so one of uh representative weiler's not
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
here but one of the things
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh he he emphasizes in this is that
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
um if if you know that
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
the federal government has changed
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
eligibilities or that we're planning on
 
01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:29.990 align:start position:0%
eligibilities or that we're planning on
changing

01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
changing
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
eligibilities in a way in which it
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
increases our
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
financial obligations that you're
 
01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:37.590 align:start position:0%
financial obligations that you're
letting

01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
letting
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
you're letting us know in a in a
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
formal direct clear communication what
 
01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:44.790 align:start position:0%
formal direct clear communication what
those

01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
um eligibilities are and what your
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
anticipated impact
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
will be right we did we did do through
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
our fiscal notes
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
um and with the legislation it's just
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
that the funding didn't end up
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
following through um and we didn't have
 
01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
control of that
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately well i'm talking in general
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
programs with all of them having
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
eligibilities if the eligibilities
 
01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:11.910 align:start position:0%
eligibilities if the eligibilities
change

01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
in a way in which it's going to cost
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
more money or save us money
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
you're letting us know on all of them i
 
01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:19.590 align:start position:0%
you're letting us know on all of them i
assume

01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
assume
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes and by statute there are certain
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
things that we have to take through
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
various committees of the legislature in
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
order to even um submit a state plan on
 
01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:32.550 align:start position:0%
order to even um submit a state plan on
those

01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
the next slide in terms of program
 
01:23:35.199 --> 01:23:37.270 align:start position:0%
the next slide in terms of program
development

01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know one of the major areas of focus
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
that we work on is a major part of
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
funding for the department comes from
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
the medicaid enhancement tax and the
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
the disproportionate share payments that
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
we make to uh
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
to hospitals um and basically in 2018
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
legislation passed in hb 1817 to
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
put together an agreement between the
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
state and the providers and
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
and the rules that have to be followed
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
there are governed
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
by both state and federal
 
01:24:16.629 --> 01:24:16.639 align:start position:0%
authority changes and as those things
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
change we have to work to
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
to modify the program to continuous
 
01:24:20.159 --> 01:24:22.149 align:start position:0%
to modify the program to continuous
compliance

01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
we also have reporting obligations um
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
which we work with
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
the medicaid finance unit and complying
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
with with the granite advantage program
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
i heard before the meeting started that
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
there's a committee that some of you may
 
01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
be participating on in terms of
 
01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:38.470 align:start position:0%
be participating on in terms of
evaluating

01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
evaluating
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
the granite advantage program and those
 
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
are the types of things that we would
 
01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:43.350 align:start position:0%
are the types of things that we would
help

01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
provides information to the committee on
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
non-emergency medical transportation is
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
an area that
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
is part of the recent reprocurement
 
01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:56.709 align:start position:0%
is part of the recent reprocurement
[Music]

01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
was was bid out differently than it had
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
been historically
 
01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
um and implemented that and i'm also
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
um proud to say that uh our team um
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
brook belanger in particular uh
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
supported the eoc and standing up
 
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
in less than two weeks time the
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
transportation to support the
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
non-medicaid benef
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
individuals in the state who otherwise
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to have transportation
 
01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and that program kicked off
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
this weekend in particular um
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
mmis is an area that we'll spend some
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
more time with but
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
for most of this past fiscal year we've
 
01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:40.550 align:start position:0%
for most of this past fiscal year we've
operated

01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
operated
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
with some significant staff vacancies
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk about that more
 
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
later and then lastly on this slide is
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
operationalizing the maternal opiate
 
01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.550 align:start position:0%
operationalizing the maternal opiate

01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%

01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
model grant that we received um
 
01:25:59.590 --> 01:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
manchester medical community coming to
 
01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
the state to help them
 
01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
be eligible to apply for two grants and
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
um these have both recently gone through
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
um both fiscal committee and governor
 
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
and council
 
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
we had a delay because of the the kovit
 
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
19 situation the first
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
people that will be enrolled and this
 
01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
will be in
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
july but basically the idea is to
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
support uh moms and the care of their
 
01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:29.189 align:start position:0%

i see representative you have a question
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative yeah representative irv
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman since you're on
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
this topic since you mentioned it
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
can you remind me what the source of
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
funds is for the advantage the grant
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
the granite advantage program sure
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
and the granite advantage program the
 
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
federal government kicks in 90 then
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
10 percent non-federal share and really
 
01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:57.990 align:start position:0%
10 percent non-federal share and really
there

01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
are that non-federal share component the
 
01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:01.030 align:start position:0%
are that non-federal share component the
10

01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
10
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
is derived from several sources
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
the premium taxes on the policies
 
01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:07.830 align:start position:0%
the premium taxes on the policies
themselves

01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
is one source
 
01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:12.470 align:start position:0%
is one source
[Music]

01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
five percent of gross liquor
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
profits is another source and
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire health plan which
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
historically was the high risk pool
 
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
that they contribute amount up to the
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
what those other two sources uh generate
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
so the liquor fund five percent
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
and the premium tax that that uh
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
those monies are kicked in to come up
 
01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
with a ten percent
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
there was also legislation passed last
 
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
session that that wasn't
 
01:27:49.110 --> 01:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
sufficient that additional liquor funds
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
could be accessed
 
01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
and that turned out to be uh timely from
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
the standpoint of the
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
surge in enrollment as a result of the
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
public health emergency
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
but that should back off when enrollment
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
goes back to
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
historic levels do you have to know the
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
rsa that
 
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:10.010 align:start position:0%
specifies all of that um i do
 
01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:11.590 align:start position:0%
specifies all of that um i do
[Music]

01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
and just to make sure i uh give it to
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
you correctly uh
 
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
um i'll ask uh athena if uh
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
gag didn't make sure to uh maybe if we
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
could bring her on if she has but i
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
think it's rsa 126
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
double a 3 is where you'll find that
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
okay so just so you know
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
um uh mr lemon uh we're gonna
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
we're gonna break for lunch uh when
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
we're through with your slides
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
so if anyone's getting hungry they can
 
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
blame you
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
the challenges facing the department
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
so public health emergency and how long
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's going to last
 
01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
creates a lot of uncertainty um in terms
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
of predicting
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
impacts um and
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
then we've as we'll talk about a little
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
bit more later we have substantial
 
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
vacancies that we've been
 
01:29:43.510 --> 01:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
contending with while at the same time
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
expanding the scope of work that we need
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
to do and then
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
lastly in terms of the unwind of the
 
01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
public health emergency if
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
we want to keep those people who are
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
eligible enrolled
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
as the public health emergency unwinds
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
but those people who aren't eligible
 
01:30:04.709 --> 01:30:04.719 align:start position:0%
that we also need to disenroll those
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
people who aren't
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
eligible any further at the end of the
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
public health emergency because
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
you know it costs 500 roughly per person
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
per month
 
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
and if you had 20 000 people who weren't
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
eligible as an example i'm not saying
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's the number but if you did that's
 
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
like 10 million dollars of expense total
 
01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:24.390 align:start position:0%
like 10 million dollars of expense total
funds

01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
and so it's important that we
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
work to um what i described is avoiding
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
a tsunami at the end of the public
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
health emergency of working through
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment and eligibility issues that
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
we're working at all along the way
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
and um so that's one area that we're
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
spending um
 
01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719 align:start position:0%
we've been planning uh and working on
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
for for many many months now
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
and uh is a high priority to make sure
 
01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:50.550 align:start position:0%
and uh is a high priority to make sure
that

01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:58.530 --> 01:30:58.540 align:start position:0%
um in terms of some workload things it's
 
01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:00.870 align:start position:0%
um in terms of some workload things it's
[Music]

01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
currently um in terms of
 
01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
medicaid staffing today we have 19 staff
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
in the division of medicaid services
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
and fully staffed including what was in
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget
 
01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
including the temporary positions would
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
be 35
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
and you know based on um
 
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
on that you can see where we have some
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
some holes and we'll talk about those a
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of beneficiaries typical
 
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
thing that is looked at as a ratio of
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries to staff
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
you know today we're operating at over
 
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
11 000 beneficiaries to
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
to division of medicaid staff you know
 
01:31:43.110 --> 01:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
if we were fully staffed we'd be
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
operating almost half of that
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
now you ask how does that compare to the
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
rest of the world
 
01:31:51.669 --> 01:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
i think you can find that new hampshire
 
01:31:52.629 --> 01:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
is probably
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
on the upper end of staff too meaning
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
less staff compared to beneficiaries but
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
it was really it's a hard statistic to
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
compare because
 
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
how a department of health and human
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
services organized a different state
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know like for example the state of
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
vermont is is organized
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
as a fifa service program and they may
 
01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:15.910 align:start position:0%
as a fifa service program and they may
have

01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
their for example their division of
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
finance may be combined with their
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
division of medicaid in
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
our department of health and human
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
services you know legal
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
and and fine and finance are organized
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
under their respective
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
um if you will uh expert areas so that
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know all the finance people are
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
under a finance department which i think
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
makes the most sense
 
01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that um you know the right
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
supervision and quality
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
is there but uh it's this just gives us
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit of sense that we've been
 
01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with some vacancies
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
um we talked about earlier in this
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
middle slide here that
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
if before you hit the middle slide
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative earth had a question
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
yeah mr clerk i'm having a hard time
 
01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
keeping up with you i apologize for that
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
um a couple slides ago the manage the
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
medicaid managed care
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
program you mentioned two two things
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
about provider rates
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
december 2019 you implemented a 3.1
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
percent increase and then
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
the first of this year or this year i
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
guess yes
 
01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
another one so are those is that
 
01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
basically six percent of our time are
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
those going to different groups and it's
 
01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent to different groups
 
01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
so the legislation that was passed was
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh across the board for providers a 3.1
 
01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
percent increase
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
so it affected nursing homes home health
 
01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
care providers
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
committee mental health centers fqhcs
 
01:33:35.679 --> 01:33:36.550 align:start position:0%
committee mental health centers fqhcs
hospitals

01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
doctors um psychologists all
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
all different areas of the department
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
that you know we have 30
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
000 providers that are enrolled in the
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
medicaid program
 
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
and um you know all the different
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
categories of providers receive some
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
type of rate increase if they were a
 
01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:55.750 align:start position:0%
type of rate increase if they were a
licensed

01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
01:33:58.629 --> 01:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
or supervised by a licensed medical
 
01:33:58.639 --> 01:33:59.590 align:start position:0%
or supervised by a licensed medical
provider

01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
provider
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
so so those are two sequential increases
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
one yes
 
01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
one just this year right thank you very
 
01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:07.350 align:start position:0%
one just this year right thank you very
much

01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
and before we get on that i i want to
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
jump to the end
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
um so to keep moving you
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
you our mms i think mm-is i think he
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
said we
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
have 100 vacancy in this area
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
yes so so what are you what are you
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
doing to maintain the systems and
 
01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
and what what's getting in the way of
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
recruiting people to
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
to manage this system so
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
if i could take the last one first there
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
was a hiring freeze
 
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
it was one aspect in terms of being able
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
to recruit them recently we've been
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
authorized to hire for the positions
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
that are available
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know we operate this system in
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the department of
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
i.t um the oit and so
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of if you will the hardware and
 
01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:57.109 align:start position:0%
in terms of if you will the hardware and
maybe

01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
it might be a good time to bring in um
 
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
david weeder's but you know basically
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
there's if you will the technical
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
performance of the system and then
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
there's if you will the applications
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's really the the application and
 
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
business development side of things that
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
um we were tremendously short-handed and
 
01:35:15.679 --> 01:35:16.070 align:start position:0%
um we were tremendously short-handed and
we've

01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
we've
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
we've had um one um vendor consultant
 
01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
that we've been using to try to
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
um keep us keep us afloat in this time
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
period of the
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze and and so forth but uh
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know we we've if you will
 
01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
underfunded last
 
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh last budget
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh appropriation we've had to find
 
01:35:42.310 --> 01:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
funds within the department to to try to
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
maintain it we
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
will talk about in a moment that we had
 
01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:47.430 align:start position:0%
will talk about in a moment that we had
risks

01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
risks
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
around the federal match percentage but
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
if if you're okay with it i think
 
01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
jumping if you want to get into mmis the
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
next two slides i think would be
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
good once to to dive into it and david
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
take the lead on that if you're okay
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
with that jim
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
before we get going uh representative
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
walner had a question i think on this
 
01:36:07.199 --> 01:36:08.629 align:start position:0%
walner had a question i think on this
slide

01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
slide
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
well i no actually it go it goes back to
 
01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:12.870 align:start position:0%
well i no actually it go it goes back to
um

01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
what representative earth was asking
 
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
about um the
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
rate increase that was in the previous
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
budget in the previous budget
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
is there any rate increase in for
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
providers in this budget
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
for the next two years there is not
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
um in the division that i oversee there
 
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
i believe you'll see in ltss there may
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
be some
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
okay but but none none for two years
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
and actually they will have gone
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
since the last rate increase was what
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
january of
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
21 yes
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
so they will have gone 27 months
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
at least before there would be any sort
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
of rate increases for these services
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative i'm i'm i'm curious why
 
01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
you didn't ask if they'd requested it
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
and the governor's
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
office didn't fund it that's that sounds
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
like a normal question you ask
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
i guess i was just a little a little uh
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
asleep at the wheel like
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
okay mr mr lipman did you request a rate
 
01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:31.430 align:start position:0%
okay mr mr lipman did you request a rate
increase

01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
um we we did not uh based on
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
um you know funding what we already
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
had in place that it was uh particularly
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
at the time we were preparing the agency
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
budget and the
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
shortfalls that were forecasted for the
 
01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
for the state that um practically uh
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
maintaining what we had was going to be
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you we can uh i'm sorry to just go
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
skim over your second slide but i think
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
we can read it and it's
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
kind of self-explanatory so we can go to
 
01:38:07.199 --> 01:38:08.149 align:start position:0%
kind of self-explanatory so we can go to
26.

01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
26.
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
okay i think this would be our plan was
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
to have david lead this and i'll add
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
some commentary as he goes through those
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
two slides
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
can you minimize your slide just a
 
01:38:21.109 --> 01:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
little bit because the way it's
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
zoomed now it's it's exceeds the screen
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
okay sorry about that thank you for
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
letting me know
 
01:38:32.229 --> 01:38:32.239 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair and members of the
 
01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
committee my name is david weeders i'm
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
the information services director for
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
health and human services and our goal
 
01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
was to go
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
dive into the medicaid management
 
01:38:44.229 --> 01:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
information system
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
the current state and where we're going
 
01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
with the system in this next biennium
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
please let me know and i'm aware of the
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
process for questions
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
so representative edwards mr chair i
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
will recognize you
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
waving your hand as you go through thank
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
you so this system
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
has gone through what we call an
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
application lifecycle management over
 
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
16 years so back in 2005 we
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
identified the system design of how we
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to implement
 
01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
the mmis system we worked with the
 
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
center for medicaid medicare and

medicaid services
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
for that system design and went out to
 
01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:23.830 align:start position:0%
for that system design and went out to
rfp

01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
rfp
 
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
and initially purchased the hardware and
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
software in 2007
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
after reward that was the last time that
 
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
we actually
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
acquired hardware and software up until
 
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
this past year where we did acquire
 
01:39:40.629 --> 01:39:40.639 align:start position:0%
some hardware and and some software
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
associated with what we call a technical
 
01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:42.950 align:start position:0%
associated with what we call a technical
stack

01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
stack
 
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
upgrade that capital project was funded
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
at about 26 million dollars of the
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
original 90 million dollars that we
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
requested to
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
manage this system in 2013 we went live
 
01:39:57.990 --> 01:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
with the system
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
six years after procuring the hardware
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
and software
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
due to many different reasons current
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
the original design was for a fee for
 
01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:08.070 align:start position:0%
the original design was for a fee for
service

01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
solution over time we also we migrated
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
to a managed care
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
in this state which required lots of
 
01:40:14.639 --> 01:40:15.189 align:start position:0%
in this state which required lots of
changes

01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
along the way as well as federal and
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
state mandates that required some
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
changes in the system and of course
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
the final complexity of it as well two
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
years later in 2015 the system was
 
01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:29.109 align:start position:0%
years later in 2015 the system was
certified

01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
certified
 
01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
and certification is a key component for
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
federal matching dollars
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
as it relates to our maintenance and
 
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
operations of these systems
 
01:40:41.669 --> 01:40:41.679 align:start position:0%
so prior to being certified we had a 50
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
match for for the maintenance and
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
operations after certification
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
we received an additional 25 percent
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
which equates to about 6.6 million
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
dollars in
 
01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
federal matching funds reducing our
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
01:40:59.430 --> 01:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
impact by that amount
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
as we as we have heard recently
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
this system is our core system to
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
process medicaid claims
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
provider services it also includes
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
third-party liability
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
um components from our other division
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
for quality
 
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
program and program integrity as well as
 
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
does the basic functions of mailroom
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
processing of reports
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
and call center functionality for the
 
01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
when you look at this yes i thought
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
you're about to go to the next slide
 
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
go ahead i'll try this i have a question
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
on this slide before you go to the next
 
01:41:39.119 --> 01:41:39.990 align:start position:0%
on this slide before you go to the next
one

01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
certainly um so just from a overall
 
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
perspective our current contract expires
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
this june
 
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
and we're anticipating an extension of
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
that contract for five years
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
to support our reprocurement efforts so
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
this system
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
based off of researching different types
 
01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
of reprocurement strategies and
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
working with other states within the
 
01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
country as well as
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
looking at different functions of
 
01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
leveraging the national association of
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
state procurement officers or looking at
 
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
regionalized government to
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
reduce our costs we've identified a
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
five-year plan
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
to replace the system through a modular
 
01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:20.390 align:start position:0%
to replace the system through a modular
reprocurement

01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
reprocurement
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
cms or center for medicare medicare
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
medicaid services
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
has a recommendation that we would do a
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
modular re-procurement
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
and has supported many other states in
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
that effort
 
01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
that five-year plan requires us to
 
01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
maintain our existing system
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
and so in the operating budget for that
 
01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
you're looking at today
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
that actually shows the increased cost
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
to maintain
 
01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
the existing system as well as ensure
 
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
that we're not
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
seeing a spike in hardware and software
 
01:42:52.239 --> 01:42:53.109 align:start position:0%
seeing a spike in hardware and software
purchases

01:42:53.109 --> 01:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
purchases
 
01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the time period the goal of
 
01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:56.229 align:start position:0%
throughout the time period the goal of
that

01:42:56.229 --> 01:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:59.590 --> 01:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
is to really flatten that that
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
investment in the mmis the current mmis
 
01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:03.510 align:start position:0%
investment in the mmis the current mmis
system

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
and not have any surprises when it comes
 
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
to hardware and software going forward
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
will i'll go ahead and stop there on
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
this slide um for any questions
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
so thanks mike my question there is over
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
this next five year cycle
 
01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
will some of the mi mmis
 
01:43:25.590 --> 01:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
functionality be able to move to
 
01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
software as a service
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
model to get us less in the hardware
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
business that's a very good question mr
 
01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:34.790 align:start position:0%
business that's a very good question mr
chair

01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
certainly our goal is to look at
 
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
software as a service modules as they
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
come available
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
for instance the provider services mod
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
module that the national association of
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
state procurement officer did a
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
a fairly large multi-state bidding
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
process that we could use as a
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
participating agreement
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
awarded to six different vendors of
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
which two or more of them
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
provide shops with some of them still
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
host their own server and software in
 
01:44:06.310 --> 01:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
their own call center
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
which you can consider a private cloud
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily the
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
software as a service that you're
 
01:44:13.590 --> 01:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
looking for all of which
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
all of our future ones would be looking
 
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
at a subscription type software as a
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
service module and i'm not a fan of the
 
01:44:22.950 --> 01:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
regionalized government approach
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't sound like that's what
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
that's when you've considered you're
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
just not going that way
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
that is correct mr chair currently when
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
we looked at the regionalized government
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
it required a lot of either one of two
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
different things
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
and so you need normally have a lead
 
01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:40.310 align:start position:0%
and so you need normally have a lead
agency

01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:44:42.550 --> 01:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
and a follow in following agencies or
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
lead state and following states
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
the lead state has a large investment in
 
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
no that's all right if we're not going
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
we don't need to spend time on it but i
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
think thank you
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
um or i don't see any other questions on
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
this slide
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
we can go to the next slide
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
so as i discussed earlier the mmis is
 
01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
a very complex system it's com it
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
composes several different modules which
 
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
you see across the top of your slide
 
01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:10.310 align:start position:0%
you see across the top of your slide
there

01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
those are just the high level modules
 
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
there are several other modules included
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
in the mmis but the the core of the
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
system is a claims processing system
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
we we look at this and we get our
 
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:24.790 align:start position:0%
we we look at this and we get our
direction

01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
primarily from state and federal
 
01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:27.990 align:start position:0%
primarily from state and federal
legislation

01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:45:30.310 --> 01:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
and we need to address our five-year
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
plan in terms of
 
01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
the priorities our current priorities
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
right now is to be able to
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
maintain our federal reporting um
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
address some of our pain points and
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
provider services
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
and call center management as well as
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
as go into what you heard maybe last
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
week i guess i believe
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
a third party liability module
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
i'm going to kick it over to henry
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
briefly to go over the some of the key
 
01:45:58.470 --> 01:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
benefits of this system
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
and then i have a i have a technical
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
question before you give it to mr
 
01:46:02.159 --> 01:46:03.270 align:start position:0%
question before you give it to mr
lippman

01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
lippman
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
um so so historically
 
01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh the concept of departmental systems
 
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
was essential because that's that's how
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
we grew right
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
we had a specific departmental need and
 
01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
we solved it
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
increasingly i think the model is
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
intended to be
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
modular at the enterprise level so
 
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
as i'm looking at these modules i'm
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
seeing a call center
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
and federal reporting and maybe training
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
and communications
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
as names of
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
modules that could potentially
 
01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
become enterprise level modules
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
so because everyone all departments have
 
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
to do some level of federal reporting
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
so so my question is kind of a strategic
 
01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:53.270 align:start position:0%
so so my question is kind of a strategic
one

01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the sense that when you're looking at
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
replacing the mmis with the more modular
 
01:47:02.709 --> 01:47:02.719 align:start position:0%
saf saas model
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
or are i assume you're also looking at
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
more of an enterprise
 
01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
concept than a departmental concept
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
could you could you speak to that
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair that's a good
 
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
question actually falls into in our
 
01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:18.639 align:start position:0%
into our strategic plan that we're
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
working on with department of
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
information technology
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
and leveraging platforms to not only
 
01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
address the medicaid but also
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
other parts of our division and
 
01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
potentially other parts of our state
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
we we actually plan on doing that kind
 
01:47:35.109 --> 01:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
of platform approach
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
in the federal reporting certainly which
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
we already started about
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
three years ago um building our
 
01:47:41.590 --> 01:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
enterprise business intelligence
 
01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:42.390 align:start position:0%
enterprise business intelligence
platform

01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
platform
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
but we have not had a chance to fully
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
integrate or basically take out of the
 
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
mmis that component
 
01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
this prod the next five years our goal
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
is to take that component out
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
and leverage that enterprise business
 
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
intelligence platform that
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
spans our entire department as well as
 
01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
our partner agencies within the state
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
continue that process of looking at
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
certainly call center training
 
01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.629 align:start position:0%
certainly call center training
communications

01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
communications
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
was another one and then the final one
 
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
that we we believe that we could
 
01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:12.709 align:start position:0%
that we we believe that we could
leverage

01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
leverage
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
enterprise approach is the claims
 
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
processing we process claims in our
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
children youth and family
 
01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
system our long-term supports and
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
services our child support as well as on
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
our medicaid and we believe that we can
 
01:48:26.470 --> 01:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
leverage that one claims engine
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
with four different what we call
 
01:48:30.709 --> 01:48:30.719 align:start position:0%
business rules and processes
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
from one vendor which will reduce our
 
01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:33.990 align:start position:0%
from one vendor which will reduce our
our

01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
footprint of systems over time does that
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
address your question mr chair
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
i i i love the concept and and hopefully
 
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh you guys will continue to work on
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
that in the strategic
 
01:48:49.109 --> 01:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
plan so i think that
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
i think that's going to give us the best
 
01:48:52.629 --> 01:48:52.639 align:start position:0%
solution at the least cost
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh and the greatest simplicity over time
 
01:48:58.950 --> 01:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
so hopefully hopefully that'll that
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
vision pans out we agree and
 
01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
we we are also hopeful for that vision
 
01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
to pan out we we've seen
 
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
um quite a bit of effort and increa
 
01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:09.669 align:start position:0%
um quite a bit of effort and increa
improved

01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
improved
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
data quality in in leveraging the
 
01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
enterprise approach for
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
for the enterprise business intelligence
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
we anticipated to
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
continue to enhance the medicaid program
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
by doing that as well as other modules
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
throughout this project any other
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
questions on this slide so unless you've
 
01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:27.030 align:start position:0%
questions on this slide so unless you've
got

01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
something you you you want to say that
 
01:49:30.629 --> 01:49:30.639 align:start position:0%
you can continue or
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
give the mystery i would like to if i
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
could uh chairman um
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
just on the right side the penalty and
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
risk is that
 
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
what we're pointing out here is that um
 
01:49:44.470 --> 01:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
without funding we would end up um
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
with a system um situation where
 
01:49:50.229 --> 01:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay uh penalties that are
 
01:49:50.239 --> 01:49:51.109 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay uh penalties that are
equal

01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
equal
 
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
to the cost of what we need to implement
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
that we haven't been able to implement
 
01:49:56.229 --> 01:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
due to lack of funding
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
and also in terms of your constituent
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
services if you will that
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
you know 30 000 providers and 215 000
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
citizens depend on the system in one way
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
or another
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
and i think that um i think the
 
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
the point we're trying to make here on
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
the right-hand side is that
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
without adequate funding we're going to
 
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
end up you know
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
running the risk of um we're going to
 
01:50:23.109 --> 01:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
have to come up with general funds of
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh somewhere around 6.6 million over the
 
01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:26.629 align:start position:0%
uh somewhere around 6.6 million over the
biennium

01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
as well as have a system that
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
potentially could lose its
 
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
compliance status and that will cost us
 
01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:34.310 align:start position:0%
compliance status and that will cost us
25

01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
federal match so i
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
i just i i i need you to be a little
 
01:50:41.109 --> 01:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
more clear with me
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
are you saying that you need money
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's not in the governor's budget and
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
we have to add it
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
no the money is in the governor's budget
 
01:50:51.030 --> 01:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
we last
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
last uh biennium we were not funded for
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
projects that we know that we needed
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
and as a result of that uh the time
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
frame to implement things we're not
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
going to make those time frames
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
without approving what's in the
 
01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
governor's budget we'll be at risk of
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
financial penalties
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
that are equal to or greater than what
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
the cost would be in general funds
 
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
if the governor's budget is funded we're
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
saying that the governor's
 
01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
budget funding is very important
 
01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
so you're also then saying that uh in
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
the fy
 
01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
21 budget if we were to uh
 
01:51:29.589 --> 01:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
freeze your funding at fy21 levels
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh you would not have enough money to
 
01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
cover this
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely we would probably also run
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
the risk of losing certification and
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
take a
 
01:51:43.109 --> 01:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
so that's good to know um
 
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
would you just send me a little note of
 
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
specifically what
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
line item this is and what the change is
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
from fy 21 to 22.
 
01:51:59.830 --> 01:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
the bottom left-hand side i think when
 
01:52:03.189 --> 01:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
we go through the line by line it'll
 
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
be fairly evident where it is and if
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
after that you still
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
need something i'll certainly provide it
 
01:52:10.629 --> 01:52:10.639 align:start position:0%
for you so i'm still learning to swing
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
through the budget i know that i need a
 
01:52:16.070 --> 01:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
a lot an accounting unit line number
 
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere and make sure that i'm i'm
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
tracing the right account
 
01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to make myself a note so then
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
we'll get to that point and karen's
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
going over things that we cover that
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
um if it's okay i can continue yes yes
 
01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
i don't see any questions i think athena
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
was going to uh athena gagnon our
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
director of
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
medicaid finance was going to help
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
address this slide athena who
 
01:52:54.070 --> 01:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
good morning so the first item that i'm
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
going to cover here is what we spoke
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
about earlier and that's the
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
funding the adult dental program we do
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
have a priority need we have a new
 
01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:06.070 align:start position:0%
have a priority need we have a new
request

01:53:06.070 --> 01:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
in the house where i'm actually lowering
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
the priority need in fiscal year 22
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
due to the change in the proposed
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
implementation date of april 1
 
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
as opposed to an implementation date of
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
september 1
 
01:53:22.229 --> 01:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
of 22.
 
01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
the other priority need that we need to
 
01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:25.589 align:start position:0%
the other priority need that we need to
actually

01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
revisit is funding the increased
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
cost of the pre-coveted enrollment if we
 
01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
don't reach it
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
until march of 2022 as henry litman
 
01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier when we built the
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
budget in august we were actually
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
anticipating that our enrollment would
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
be at pre-covered levels
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
by july 1 of 2021
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
new indications of course with the
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
rollout of the vaccination
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
and the second surge that we saw during
 
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
the holiday season
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
we are anticipating in the governor's
 
01:53:59.199 --> 01:53:59.910 align:start position:0%
we are anticipating in the governor's
budget

01:53:59.910 --> 01:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
that the public health emergency period
 
01:54:05.430 --> 01:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
will end in december of 2021
 
01:54:08.229 --> 01:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
which would allow us 90 days to
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
disenroll those members
 
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
and we would reach pre-covered levels by
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
the third item that we also need funding
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
for again is something that mr whitman
 
01:54:25.589 --> 01:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
and that is in relation to the mead
 
01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:29.030 align:start position:0%
and that is in relation to the mead
program

01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
in funding the in and out
 
01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:34.719 align:start position:0%
and that priority need in total funds
 
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
and general funds is listed
 
01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:40.950 align:start position:0%
and general funds is listed
below

01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
if we were to decrease our budget
 
01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
there are some items that are listed
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
obviously not recommended but they would
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
be eliminating coverage for the optional
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility groups
 
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
we could not make any changes to those
 
01:54:58.950 --> 01:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
until after the public health emergency
 
01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:00.310 align:start position:0%
until after the public health emergency
period

01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
same goes for optional covered services
 
01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
now the top three being pharmacy
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
home and community based services and
 
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
community mental health
 
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
centers those are all listed in the
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
briefing book on pages 70 and 71
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
and then also just mentioned earlier is
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
the risk if the mmis
 
01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
is not funded the risk certification
 
01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
which um
 
01:55:26.950 --> 01:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
david readers mentioned would be a
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
impact of 6.6 million annually
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
i guess i would emphasize that these are
 
01:55:35.589 --> 01:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
things that we're not
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
recommending but in terms of trying to
 
01:55:38.159 --> 01:55:39.030 align:start position:0%
recommending but in terms of trying to
reduce

01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
01:55:41.350 --> 01:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh based on the requirements of what a
 
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
mandatory services there's
 
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
not a lot of room um to to do things
 
01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
other than things that really
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
would have a negative effect on on many
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state if you were to
 
01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
recommend reducing your budget you would
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
be the first director i think in
 
01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
u.s history to ever have done that so so
 
01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:02.870 align:start position:0%
u.s history to ever have done that so so
we

01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
we're not breaking ground on that today
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
hey but i did want to say
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh this is the uh about the
 
01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
eighth or ninth time we've seen a slide
 
01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
like this and this is really the most
 
01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:14.629 align:start position:0%
like this and this is really the most
developed

01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
developed
 
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
um so so thank you it's the most useful
 
01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:56:23.189 --> 01:56:23.199 align:start position:0%
i'm fortunate to have an excellent
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
finance director and working with athena
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
very experienced and
 
01:56:30.629 --> 01:56:30.639 align:start position:0%
on the on the next slide kind of shows
 
01:56:30.639 --> 01:56:31.510 align:start position:0%
on the on the next slide kind of shows
the

01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
the the team um that's within the
 
01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:34.870 align:start position:0%
the the team um that's within the
division

01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
um well athena is technically in the
 
01:56:38.709 --> 01:56:38.719 align:start position:0%
finance division
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
um she's a key player to making the
 
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
division of medicaid services
 
01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
work in terms of budget and policy
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
issues that require
 
01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
money is the size of the slide okay
 
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
can you see this okay sure oh yeah it's
 
01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:57.350 align:start position:0%
can you see this okay sure oh yeah it's
great

01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
so just in terms of the the team i'm
 
01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have a lot of
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
good people that have been able to and
 
01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
willing to step
 
01:57:11.109 --> 01:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
up and do go above and beyond
 
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with a lot of the vacancy issues
 
01:57:14.310 --> 01:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
that we've had
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
um there's my role as the the director
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
and again
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
consultant to many other divisions and
 
01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:21.669 align:start position:0%
consultant to many other divisions and

had someone who retired
 
02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
who had been with us over 40 years who
 
02:00:33.669 --> 02:00:33.679 align:start position:0%

02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
tremendously during this time
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
but all the eligibility uh rules and
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%

pharmacy drug list pharmaceutical drug
 
02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
list and
 
02:01:22.149 --> 02:01:22.159 align:start position:0%
that's a recommended practice uh to help
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
with pharmacy costs from a financial
 
02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
standpoint as well as from

person retired during early 2020
 
02:01:43.109 --> 02:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
and that position again helps us
 
02:01:44.229 --> 02:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
interface with
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
the 30 000 providers we actually have
 
02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:49.679 align:start position:0%
two vacancies currently in that unit
 
02:01:52.629 --> 02:01:52.639 align:start position:0%

02:03:43.030 --> 02:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
and the the governor's budget there's
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
also two temporary positions which are
 
02:03:44.719 --> 02:03:45.750 align:start position:0%
also two temporary positions which are
footnoted

02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
footnoted
 
02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
in the mmis areas temporary the
 
02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:51.690 align:start position:0%
next column is our vacancies
 
02:03:51.690 --> 02:03:52.950 align:start position:0%
next column is our vacancies
[Music]

02:03:52.950 --> 02:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:03:55.109 --> 02:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
and then the vacancy rate in those
 
02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
positions and then
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
just kind of the the general description
 
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
of kind of where they fit
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
under our um medicaid services
 
02:04:08.709 --> 02:04:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
just suffice it to say we the mmis whole
 
02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:12.550 align:start position:0%
just suffice it to say we the mmis whole
is

02:04:12.550 --> 02:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
very important to to fill um
 
02:04:19.990 --> 02:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
and we're struggling with the
 
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
you know in the clinical area and
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
the provider relations area in
 
02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:26.149 align:start position:0%
the provider relations area in
particular

02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:04:28.470 --> 02:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh with the workload and you know
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
rolling out new benefits and having
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
fewer people and and greater enrollment
 
02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:34.550 align:start position:0%
fewer people and and greater enrollment
so

02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
these are i think are very important
 
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
positions i think the governor saw as
 
02:04:38.709 --> 02:04:38.719 align:start position:0%
well in his
 
02:04:41.750 --> 02:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
proposed budget well if you
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
pay more than 100 a year i'll start
 
02:04:43.679 --> 02:04:46.709 align:start position:0%
pay more than 100 a year i'll start
monday

02:04:46.709 --> 02:04:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
and henry could i just jump in there for
 
02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
a half a second
 
02:04:52.709 --> 02:04:52.719 align:start position:0%
so one of the things i wanted to mention
 
02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
chair and i know that the report is
 
02:04:55.669 --> 02:04:55.679 align:start position:0%
outstanding still
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
and as soon as it is public i will have
 
02:04:58.870 --> 02:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
it to the committee
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
uh but one of the things that alvarez
 
02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
and marcel looked at
 
02:05:04.629 --> 02:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
was staffing across the department but
 
02:05:06.550 --> 02:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
especially staffing and medicaid and
 
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
comparing it to
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
some of our neighboring states and
 
02:05:11.589 --> 02:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
compared to some of our neighboring
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
states we
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
most certainly run leaner in our
 
02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
medicaid department
 
02:05:18.790 --> 02:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
so that's just something of note thank
 
02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:19.350 align:start position:0%
so that's just something of note thank
you

02:05:19.350 --> 02:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
and speaking of the end of the m a
 
02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:22.950 align:start position:0%
and speaking of the end of the m a
report

02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
when one what's the most current
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
estimate for
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
for when we can get our uh our first
 
02:05:33.270 --> 02:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
secret copy of it so unfortunately i
 
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
can't provide you a secret copy of it i
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
will provide you the document as soon as
 
02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
it is public
 
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
um i i don't want to promise you a date
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then not meet it uh
 
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
i really don't like to do that i i hope
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
it'll be this week but
 
02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
i think karen you're gonna pick up from
 
02:05:56.560 --> 02:05:58.149 align:start position:0%
i think karen you're gonna pick up from
here

02:05:58.149 --> 02:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:06:01.109 --> 02:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
or is it am i right on that or athena
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
i don't see athena unmuting so i'll go
 
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
ahead um and just speak to it
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
of course medicaid budget is one of our
 
02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
largest budgets
 
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
so um well this although this chart
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
lays out all of the information i don't
 
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
know that um
 
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's the most helpful to to see it this
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
way i think
 
02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
looking at each of the accounting units
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
is probably going to be a lot more
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
helpful but this does give you
 
02:06:29.109 --> 02:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
a little bit of sense of the overall
 
02:06:29.119 --> 02:06:33.510 align:start position:0%
a little bit of sense of the overall
budget

02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
what's the overall issue between the
 
02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:37.750 align:start position:0%
what's the overall issue between the
expansion

02:06:37.750 --> 02:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
02:06:41.109 --> 02:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
of of general funds in the current
 
02:06:41.119 --> 02:06:42.069 align:start position:0%
of of general funds in the current
budget

02:06:42.069 --> 02:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:06:44.069 --> 02:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
and the reduction in general funds in
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
the next budget
 
02:06:47.990 --> 02:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
what's just the general story the one
 
02:06:50.310 --> 02:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
sentence uh so the general funds are
 
02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
actually increasing they're the
 
02:06:55.030 --> 02:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
the red um piece of the chart
 
02:06:58.149 --> 02:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh uh i
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
would say half of that is related to the
 
02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:02.709 align:start position:0%
would say half of that is related to the
dcyf

02:07:02.709 --> 02:07:02.719 align:start position:0%
dcyf
 
02:07:04.229 --> 02:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
costs coming over into the medicaid
 
02:07:08.069 --> 02:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
somewhere in that range but you'll see
 
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
more of that as we go through the actual
 
02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:13.430 align:start position:0%
more of that as we go through the actual
budget

02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:07:14.950 --> 02:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
and the federal matching percentage
 
02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
change right
 
02:07:18.069 --> 02:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
right and the federal matching percent
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
just in terms of federal matching this
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
is just a
 
02:07:28.310 --> 02:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
reference slide for you in terms of you
 
02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
know how the federal match is determined
 
02:07:33.430 --> 02:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
nationally as has to do with per capita
 
02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
incomes and
 
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
so we said earlier in the slot earlier
 
02:07:38.229 --> 02:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:07:39.990 --> 02:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
presentation that new hampshire's
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
minimum is 50
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
um but some states like you know
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
mississippi comes to mind
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
you know that are um the poorer states
 
02:07:51.510 --> 02:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
um get a higher match and that's just
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
there's nothing we can do about that
 
02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
it's a statutory thing at a federal
 
02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:56.149 align:start position:0%
it's a statutory thing at a federal
level

02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:07:59.910 --> 02:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
so mississippi has a higher proportion
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
of federal money to state money because
 
02:08:03.270 --> 02:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
of their higher need
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
is that what you just said correct their
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
poverty in particular
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
the you can see the northeast is tends
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
to be lighter
 
02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh new hampshire's
 
02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079 align:start position:0%
has poverty that needs to be addressed
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
for sure but
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
you know relatively we're compared to
 
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country you know we're
 
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
economically as is massachusetts
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
connecticut rhode island
 
02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:28.290 align:start position:0%
um in better shape
 
02:08:28.290 --> 02:08:31.910 align:start position:0%
um in better shape
[Music]

02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
and we put together a slide again this
 
02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
is sort of a reference slide for you
 
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the different federal
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
matching rates
 
02:08:42.550 --> 02:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
at different time periods if you'd like
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
us to
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
to dive into this a little bit be
 
02:08:47.589 --> 02:08:47.599 align:start position:0%
willing to do so but i just
 
02:08:49.030 --> 02:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you something here in the
 
02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
interest of time that shows how the
 
02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
federal matching rate
 
02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
changes under the enhancement and how
 
02:08:56.510 --> 02:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
the enhancement changes over time
 
02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:58.310 align:start position:0%
the enhancement changes over time

02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:09:02.550 --> 02:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman can you speak to
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
how you intend
 
02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
to share the benefit of the enhanced
 
02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
federal match with
 
02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
the medicaid providers in particular the
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
counties and all the county lines not
 
02:09:14.390 --> 02:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
just the
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
not just the nursing home line
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
so the i guess the short answer is it's
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a simple
 
02:09:26.390 --> 02:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
um response i think as as you know
 
02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
because you serve on it there's a
 
02:09:30.390 --> 02:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
county and state finance committee
 
02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
that's looking at it with respect to the
 
02:09:38.470 --> 02:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
county cap but the intent of the
 
02:09:41.189 --> 02:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
enhanced fmap is to cover the expanded
 
02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
population we have as i
 
02:09:47.030 --> 02:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier you know a 21.5
 
02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:47.589 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier you know a 21.5
percent

02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
increase in total enrollment
 
02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
and that comes with some cost and
 
02:09:58.069 --> 02:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
so that um you know in terms of covering
 
02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
the increased enrollment the the
 
02:10:01.910 --> 02:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
published studies on this for example
 
02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
the kaiser foundation
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
does not expect at least to the this
 
02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
point the enhanced fmap to cover states
 
02:10:09.910 --> 02:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
costs in total
 
02:10:11.750 --> 02:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of the expanded enrollment and
 
02:10:14.229 --> 02:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
expanded utilization
 
02:10:16.550 --> 02:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
i think i'll let karen maybe add to that
 
02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:17.270 align:start position:0%
i think i'll let karen maybe add to that
explanation

02:10:17.270 --> 02:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
if she would like to but i think
 
02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
generally the enhanced
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
f map is intended to cover the expanded
 
02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
population that you have to cover
 
02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
and is also sort of the you know at the
 
02:10:29.109 --> 02:10:29.119 align:start position:0%
time that
 
02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
it ends um the public health emergency
 
02:10:33.430 --> 02:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
ends we're obligated to
 
02:10:35.589 --> 02:10:35.599 align:start position:0%
provide uh coverage to the end of that
 
02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
month and
 
02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
um i think that's uh
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the story to this point
 
02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
that could be um i think over time
 
02:10:46.629 --> 02:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
um you know we've identified for example
 
02:10:48.069 --> 02:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
in the county area that
 
02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
you know there is by statute a
 
02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
percentage that
 
02:10:54.709 --> 02:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
that the counties are responsible for if
 
02:10:55.990 --> 02:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
if the fmap goes
 
02:10:59.109 --> 02:10:59.119 align:start position:0%
on for a certain amount of time that
 
02:11:01.109 --> 02:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
it would potentially become a credit
 
02:11:02.229 --> 02:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
available i know there are other
 
02:11:05.430 --> 02:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
discussions there that i don't want to
 
02:11:09.189 --> 02:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
get ahead of but i think in general that
 
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
the additional f maps intended to cover
 
02:11:12.310 --> 02:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
the additional enrollment
 
02:11:14.790 --> 02:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
and and again that for many states the
 
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
additional f map might not cover
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
all the additional enrollment costs
 
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
know karen if you want to add to that at
 
02:11:25.270 --> 02:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
all i guess the only thing i would add
 
02:11:26.069 --> 02:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
is that the
 
02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:29.599 align:start position:0%
the county funds are not in the medicaid
 
02:11:31.669 --> 02:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
budget they're in the long term supports
 
02:11:33.189 --> 02:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
and services budget which we will cover
 
02:11:37.510 --> 02:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead so yeah no i thank you i'm just
 
02:11:46.069 --> 02:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
trying to um
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
form the question so they are medicaid
 
02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
services or no
 
02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
yes it is medicaid uh but because
 
02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:55.109 align:start position:0%
yes it is medicaid uh but because
they're

02:11:55.109 --> 02:11:55.119 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
for long-term supports like nursing
 
02:11:58.229 --> 02:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
facilities we
 
02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
we do have that within the long-term
 
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
supports budget as well as
 
02:12:04.629 --> 02:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
like the uh the dd budget is also
 
02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid it's a medicaid waiver
 
02:12:08.229 --> 02:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
and that is in with the long-term
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
supports and services budget we if we
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
lumped that all into one budget
 
02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
more than half of dhhs's budget would be
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
there are 16 accounts that have some
 
02:12:22.149 --> 02:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
level of medicaid participation that's
 
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
what i was
 
02:12:24.629 --> 02:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
speaking at the beginning that we both
 
02:12:28.069 --> 02:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
run a program and provide support to
 
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
other divisions in the department to be
 
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
able to draw medicaid funds
 
02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
for their programs so just so i
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
the medicaid component actually shows up
 
02:12:40.390 --> 02:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
in many different budgets it doesn't
 
02:12:43.990 --> 02:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily say medicaid with it
 
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
um apparently how the the different
 
02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
units um designate the medicaid
 
02:12:52.550 --> 02:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
component in their budgets but i might
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
let you or or athena answer that part of
 
02:12:55.669 --> 02:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
the question
 
02:12:58.790 --> 02:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
or so as far as medicaid services
 
02:13:01.589 --> 02:13:01.599 align:start position:0%
like paying a provider for the most part
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:13:05.109 --> 02:13:05.119 align:start position:0%
in the medicaid budget and in the long
 
02:13:07.030 --> 02:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
term supports and services budget
 
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
there might be a little bit in other
 
02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
areas of the department but that was
 
02:13:12.229 --> 02:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
as we spoke about moving the dcyf
 
02:13:14.149 --> 02:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
medicaid costs into standard medicaid
 
02:13:15.910 --> 02:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
that was part of trying to consolidate
 
02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:16.709 align:start position:0%
that was part of trying to consolidate
that

02:13:16.709 --> 02:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes to medicaid administration
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
that is probably in
 
02:13:25.830 --> 02:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
75 of the accounting units across the
 
02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:26.550 align:start position:0%
75 of the accounting units across the
department

02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
right my salary is partially paid with
 
02:13:30.629 --> 02:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
medicaid administration
 
02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
the commissioners is et cetera et cetera
 
02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:34.310 align:start position:0%
the commissioners is et cetera et cetera
but

02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:13:36.790 --> 02:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
as far as paying providers for the most
 
02:13:39.030 --> 02:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
part it's in those two budgets
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative it sounds like you're
 
02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:46.229 align:start position:0%
representative it sounds like you're
satisfied

02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
satisfied
 
02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
yes thank you all right so
 
02:13:53.589 --> 02:13:53.599 align:start position:0%
we can go on and just i want to give a
 
02:13:55.270 --> 02:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i want to give a heads up to
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
the folks who are listening in the
 
02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:59.030 align:start position:0%
the folks who are listening in the
attendees

02:13:59.030 --> 02:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
attendees
 
02:14:02.629 --> 02:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
i see several of you who are
 
02:14:05.589 --> 02:14:05.599 align:start position:0%
expected guests on wednesday afternoon
 
02:14:07.109 --> 02:14:07.119 align:start position:0%
i'm looking forward to talking to you
 
02:14:07.119 --> 02:14:07.910 align:start position:0%
i'm looking forward to talking to you
then

02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
if there's any attendee that has a short
 
02:14:13.189 --> 02:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
comment to make to help
 
02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
the committee make some of these
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
decisions we have to make
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh you'll you'll get an opportunity here
 
02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
in a moment to raise your hand
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to like you to keep it
 
02:14:25.750 --> 02:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
short if you do have something to say
 
02:14:28.310 --> 02:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
all right so so go ahead sorry for the
 
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
interruption and i think we're ready to
 
02:14:32.069 --> 02:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
close out
 
02:14:34.229 --> 02:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
so the last two slides are really the
 
02:14:35.669 --> 02:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
the detail i think you're looking to
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
walk through
 
02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
um after you have your lunch break which
 
02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
is the
 
02:14:42.629 --> 02:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
unit by unit uh line by line items
 
02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
i think uh where we've done i think with
 
02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:47.030 align:start position:0%
i think uh where we've done i think with
what

02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:14:50.229 --> 02:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
we needed to share with you um unless
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
there are further questions on
 
02:14:55.750 --> 02:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
the prize slides i just have a general
 
02:14:57.430 --> 02:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
question and we will dive into the
 
02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
details but the idn
 
02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
fund yes what what what do we think
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
we're buying
 
02:15:06.550 --> 02:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
with an idn fund so when the new budget
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
there's there's no money in the budget
 
02:15:10.149 --> 02:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:15:11.589 --> 02:15:11.599 align:start position:0%
in terms the reason that's still in
 
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
there is because of the history
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh aspect of of it and so there are zero
 
02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:17.510 align:start position:0%
uh aspect of of it and so there are zero
funds

02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:15:19.750 --> 02:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
requested and zero funds appropriated in
 
02:15:21.430 --> 02:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget
 
02:15:25.030 --> 02:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
for uh 22-23 the waiver ended
 
02:15:28.870 --> 02:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
december 31st of of 21 there is a
 
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
run-out period that runs through the
 
02:15:31.589 --> 02:15:31.599 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year
 
02:15:35.990 --> 02:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh 21 but there won't be expenses in 20
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
right uh are there any questions at this
 
02:15:42.239 --> 02:15:43.669 align:start position:0%
right uh are there any questions at this
point

02:15:43.669 --> 02:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:15:46.950 --> 02:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh are there anyone in the
 
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
attendees that have something to share
 
02:15:49.990 --> 02:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
for the good
 
02:15:53.830 --> 02:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
of the cause uh if not we're gonna go to
 
02:15:53.840 --> 02:15:54.310 align:start position:0%
of the cause uh if not we're gonna go to
uh

02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:57.910 --> 02:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
to lunch and we'll break until 12
 
02:16:01.990 --> 02:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
30 i think i'm not seeing any hands up
 
02:16:03.830 --> 02:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
do you see any hands up mr ripple and
 
02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:04.069 align:start position:0%
do you see any hands up mr ripple and
the

02:16:04.069 --> 02:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:16:08.950 --> 02:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
so um i i'm proposing we uh take a lunch
 
02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
break until 12 30.
 
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
does anyone think they need more time
 
02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
than that
 
02:16:22.069 --> 02:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
speak up if you do all right
 
02:16:25.270 --> 02:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
so let's uh i will put our hearing into
 
02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:25.910 align:start position:0%
so let's uh i will put our hearing into
recess

02:16:25.910 --> 02:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
recess
 
02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:37.270 --> 02:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
karen do you need me to share no i will
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
share as soon as the chair is ready
 
02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay so being 12 30 and being
 
02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
that hopefully everyone's had enough
 
02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
time to
 
02:16:48.950 --> 02:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
eat a satisfying lunch we're ready to
 
02:16:51.750 --> 02:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
get into the financials of the medicaid
 
02:16:54.790 --> 02:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
area and
 
02:16:59.349 --> 02:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:01.509 --> 02:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
oh wait wait uh representative irf has
 
02:17:03.589 --> 02:17:03.599 align:start position:0%
an initial question yes sir
 
02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
i just that's a question touching on
 
02:17:07.349 --> 02:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
what we end with last
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
you talked about the fmap is here um
 
02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
expansion that that was where the costs
 
02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:15.030 align:start position:0%
expansion that that was where the costs
were

02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:17:16.709 --> 02:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
what is that expansion who's in that
 
02:17:19.509 --> 02:17:19.519 align:start position:0%
expansion population
 
02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
so um the way the maintenance of effort
 
02:17:25.669 --> 02:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
is anybody who as of the date of the
 
02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
start of the public health emergency
 
02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:29.110 align:start position:0%
start of the public health emergency
remains

02:17:29.110 --> 02:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
remains
 
02:17:31.509 --> 02:17:31.519 align:start position:0%
covered by medicaid through the end of
 
02:17:33.349 --> 02:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
the public health emergency
 
02:17:35.669 --> 02:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether there's a change
 
02:17:37.509 --> 02:17:37.519 align:start position:0%
in circumstance or not that
 
02:17:39.669 --> 02:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
has a national policy that to make sure
 
02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
that people have health insurance
 
02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:41.589 align:start position:0%
that people have health insurance
coverage

02:17:41.589 --> 02:17:41.599 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
through the pandemic that um if
 
02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
if we ordinarily would have a churn of
 
02:17:49.509 --> 02:17:49.519 align:start position:0%
maybe like 2500 people a month
 
02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
we we don't have that because of the
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort requirement
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay but still i'm not who is it what
 
02:17:56.709 --> 02:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
what i mean
 
02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
you you implied it wasn't people in
 
02:17:59.750 --> 02:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
nursing homes so who is it
 
02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
it is it is people um and long-term
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
services and support it's every
 
02:18:08.070 --> 02:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
every category if you go back to the
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
um trying to think of what slide it was
 
02:18:11.910 --> 02:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
in the slide deck
 
02:18:14.870 --> 02:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
um give me one second here it's
 
02:18:15.750 --> 02:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
basically just
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
everyone who at the date of the
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
emergency was in medicaid
 
02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
for whatever eligibility reason
 
02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
continues with medicaid
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
throughout regardless of change
 
02:18:27.359 --> 02:18:28.469 align:start position:0%
throughout regardless of change
circumstances

02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
right if you go to slide 11
 
02:18:31.509 --> 02:18:31.519 align:start position:0%
representative earth of the
 
02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
slide deck that was this morning that
 
02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%
shows you each of the the categories the
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
the growth in that so it was
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
but just on a global level of the 37 000
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
increase you know a good percentage of
 
02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:44.549 align:start position:0%
increase you know a good percentage of
those

02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:18:48.469 --> 02:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
are um are people from the moe
 
02:18:51.830 --> 02:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
and about a little more than half are a
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
granted advantage
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
um and then the other part is the
 
02:18:58.870 --> 02:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
standard population and again i think
 
02:19:00.549 --> 02:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
the maps also give you a little bit of
 
02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
insight into that as well
 
02:19:06.150 --> 02:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
can i follow up does does that
 
02:19:08.629 --> 02:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
is that slide specifically talking about
 
02:19:08.639 --> 02:19:09.589 align:start position:0%
is that slide specifically talking about
the

02:19:09.589 --> 02:19:09.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
enhanced f now that's the slide
 
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
of people that have remained on medicaid
 
02:19:15.910 --> 02:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
or or how
 
02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
the population growth has gone in um but
 
02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
we could
 
02:19:22.230 --> 02:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
do something different in terms of i
 
02:19:24.309 --> 02:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
think your precise question may be is
 
02:19:27.429 --> 02:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
how many people are are the moe
 
02:19:29.190 --> 02:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
category we don't exactly know that
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
number um
 
02:19:33.429 --> 02:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
because we don't haven't seen whether
 
02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
people's circumstances have changed or
 
02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:35.669 align:start position:0%
people's circumstances have changed or
not

02:19:35.669 --> 02:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
entirely i i'm not really looking for
 
02:19:42.549 --> 02:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
the what i'm trying to understand i the
 
02:19:42.559 --> 02:19:43.349 align:start position:0%
the what i'm trying to understand i the
implication

02:19:43.349 --> 02:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
implication
 
02:19:46.230 --> 02:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
you in your previous comments about when
 
02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:46.469 align:start position:0%
you in your previous comments about when
i

02:19:46.469 --> 02:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:19:48.870 --> 02:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
was asking you about the nursing homes
 
02:19:50.309 --> 02:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
in those facilities
 
02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
when you spoke about the expanded fmap
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
the implication to me that i heard
 
02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
saying was that that's not where the
 
02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
extra expense was
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
it was some is some other age group some
 
02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:00.389 align:start position:0%
it was some is some other age group some
other

02:20:00.389 --> 02:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:20:03.110 --> 02:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
group of people not the ones who are in
 
02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes or in those other
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
long-term facilities so
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
can you just clarify that for me sure so
 
02:20:12.710 --> 02:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
as an example in medic
 
02:20:15.270 --> 02:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
medicaid the health insurance program as
 
02:20:16.150 --> 02:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
an example
 
02:20:19.510 --> 02:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
we were operating at 177 000 or so
 
02:20:21.429 --> 02:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
individuals before the start of the
 
02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
public health emergency
 
02:20:26.070 --> 02:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
um we had to increase our contract
 
02:20:28.070 --> 02:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
limitation for example the mco program
 
02:20:30.150 --> 02:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
by almost a half a billion dollars
 
02:20:32.389 --> 02:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
initially to account for the extra
 
02:20:33.830 --> 02:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
enrollment um
 
02:20:35.429 --> 02:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
that was going to be in that that
 
02:20:37.590 --> 02:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
program and so
 
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about nursing home we
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
do know that the number of missions
 
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
because of
 
02:20:44.230 --> 02:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
covid went down but in home and
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
community-based services and other
 
02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
parts of the medicaid budget there are
 
02:20:50.389 --> 02:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
increases in enrollment so someone
 
02:20:53.429 --> 02:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
in the nursing home um
 
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
nursing home days went down you're right
 
02:20:58.230 --> 02:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
you're correct about that
 
02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:09.110 --> 02:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
no okay so as long as you prime that
 
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
area um
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
i i'm um i'm curious if
 
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
we are doing any if there's any way for
 
02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:19.910 align:start position:0%
we are doing any if there's any way for
us

02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:21:23.190 --> 02:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
to track people whose circumstances have
 
02:21:23.200 --> 02:21:24.230 align:start position:0%
to track people whose circumstances have
changed

02:21:24.230 --> 02:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
changed
 
02:21:27.510 --> 02:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
that need to be disenrolled or you know
 
02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:28.230 align:start position:0%
that need to be disenrolled or you know
how

02:21:28.230 --> 02:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:21:30.150 --> 02:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
it sounded to me like you already were
 
02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
aware of some that
 
02:21:33.429 --> 02:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
that are candidates for disenrollment
 
02:21:35.830 --> 02:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
once the emergency is order
 
02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
over but uh to what extent do we have
 
02:21:42.150 --> 02:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
visibility into that population
 
02:21:45.270 --> 02:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
so we have visibility into for example
 
02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:45.750 align:start position:0%
so we have visibility into for example
people

02:21:45.750 --> 02:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
like children that age out of the
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
children's category we have visibility
 
02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
of people who
 
02:21:53.349 --> 02:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
are maybe wearing granite advantage and
 
02:21:53.359 --> 02:21:53.910 align:start position:0%
are maybe wearing granite advantage and
age

02:21:53.910 --> 02:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
age
 
02:21:57.190 --> 02:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
and agent to medicare as their primary
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
so those are types of things we have
 
02:22:00.309 --> 02:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
visibility on
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
whether someone's income for example has
 
02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:04.550 align:start position:0%
whether someone's income for example has
changed

02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
changed
 
02:22:06.790 --> 02:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
we have some visibility on on that for
 
02:22:08.790 --> 02:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
certain groups of people where
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
we can access uh certain databases
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
federal databases and
 
02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
state databases but for other people we
 
02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
02:22:19.429 --> 02:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
um but we know for example today there
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
are about
 
02:22:24.630 --> 02:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
18 000 um redeterminations that
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
that where we're waiting or we need to
 
02:22:29.349 --> 02:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
know which is about half the population
 
02:22:31.510 --> 02:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
of the 37 000 increase we're waiting to
 
02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
see um
 
02:22:34.630 --> 02:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
you know whether at the time the public
 
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
health emergency ends whether
 
02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason would they continue
 
02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
or not continue to to qualify and that's
 
02:22:40.960 --> 02:22:41.590 align:start position:0%
or not continue to to qualify and that's
a

02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:22:43.110 --> 02:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
when i was talking about the end of the
 
02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
public health emergency and the
 
02:22:46.630 --> 02:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
unwinding we have to sort through
 
02:22:48.309 --> 02:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
that group to make sure that people who
 
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
aren't eligible don't continue but those
 
02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
who are
 
02:22:52.150 --> 02:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
most importantly particularly the
 
02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
vulnerable mentally ill and
 
02:22:56.790 --> 02:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
other disabilities that we make sure
 
02:22:58.389 --> 02:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
that people who are eligible remain
 
02:23:00.309 --> 02:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
eligible and that's a
 
02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
one of our biggest i think tasks and um
 
02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
again i think when
 
02:23:07.990 --> 02:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
um there's a ability to share the a
 
02:23:09.349 --> 02:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
m report you'll see that they have some
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
comment on that as well
 
02:23:14.550 --> 02:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
so 18 000 redeterminations
 
02:23:17.429 --> 02:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
that sounds like easily six to 12 months
 
02:23:18.870 --> 02:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
worth of workload
 
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
um we're not going to be able to uh
 
02:23:24.070 --> 02:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to let it
 
02:23:26.950 --> 02:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
take that long we're doing pre-work we
 
02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
want to do it considerably shorter time
 
02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
than that
 
02:23:32.790 --> 02:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh we uh you know
 
02:23:34.870 --> 02:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
we're trying to target it to get it done
 
02:23:37.750 --> 02:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
um within the quarter that um that the
 
02:23:37.760 --> 02:23:38.230 align:start position:0%
um within the quarter that um that the
federal

02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
match is available is is kind of what
 
02:23:41.270 --> 02:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
we're working towards
 
02:23:44.710 --> 02:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
operationally all right sounds
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
sounds uh sounds great thank you um
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions before we
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
start to to break out the financial
 
02:23:52.319 --> 02:23:54.389 align:start position:0%
start to to break out the financial
sheets

02:23:54.389 --> 02:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
sheets
 
02:24:00.150 --> 02:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
okay i think we're ready great
 
02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
all right so uh just going to the end of
 
02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
henry's presentation you'll see here
 
02:24:08.469 --> 02:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
the first account accounting unit is the
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
mom grant which is
 
02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
on page 989 accounting unit
 
02:24:30.150 --> 02:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
chair if you're speaking we can't hear
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
you i i'm just letting you know i i
 
02:24:38.389 --> 02:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
surf to that part of my spreadsheet
 
02:24:41.830 --> 02:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
so i can see it more easily
 
02:24:43.990 --> 02:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
so this looks like it's all federal
 
02:24:45.990 --> 02:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
funds and the federal funds are about to
 
02:24:48.150 --> 02:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
grow dramatically
 
02:24:50.070 --> 02:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
that's what we anticipate i do believe
 
02:24:52.469 --> 02:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
that this is a grant that's awarded
 
02:24:56.950 --> 02:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
annually so you know it's possible um
 
02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
that things will change but this is what
 
02:25:01.110 --> 02:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
we're anticipating
 
02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay why are these several pages do we
 
02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:04.469 align:start position:0%
okay why are these several pages do we
show

02:25:04.469 --> 02:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
show
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:12.950 --> 02:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
there are no employees associated with
 
02:25:15.110 --> 02:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
this grant the the employees that help
 
02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
manage this grant are in the
 
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
medicaid administrative accounting unit
 
02:25:22.150 --> 02:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you there there is actually one
 
02:25:24.469 --> 02:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
position that's tied to this grant
 
02:25:28.070 --> 02:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
and it is in class 59 thank you
 
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
and i just want to add to you that this
 
02:25:31.429 --> 02:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
grant was awarded um
 
02:25:34.870 --> 02:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
january of 2020.
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
so how many how many moms do we think we
 
02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:43.190 align:start position:0%
so how many how many moms do we think we
can

02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:25:46.309 --> 02:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
service with 750 000
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
of federal money we're
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
i think targeting approximately 300
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:00.950 --> 02:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay does that also mean we have 300
 
02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:01.830 align:start position:0%
okay does that also mean we have 300
moms

02:26:01.830 --> 02:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
moms
 
02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
who are pregnant and on who are also on
 
02:26:06.309 --> 02:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
opioids or is this
 
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of prevention effort as well um
 
02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
it could be both it could be someone who
 
02:26:14.790 --> 02:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
is is using or someone that
 
02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
is at risk but generally it's targeted
 
02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
at those
 
02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
who um from a net from a historical
 
02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
standpoint looking at nas
 
02:26:27.190 --> 02:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
babies uh those that are uh addicted on
 
02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:27.910 align:start position:0%
babies uh those that are uh addicted on
birth

02:26:27.910 --> 02:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
birth
 
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
that we estimate at least on a
 
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
historical basis that you know between
 
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
200 and 300
 
02:26:36.469 --> 02:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh births of potential um exposure
 
02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
so what's the nature of this contract
 
02:26:46.550 --> 02:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
we've got contract for program
 
02:26:49.190 --> 02:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
services what what what kind of what
 
02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
kind of scope is in that contract
 
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
so just from a bit of a background
 
02:26:55.910 --> 02:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint it was the
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
manchester community came to the
 
02:26:57.680 --> 02:26:58.950 align:start position:0%
manchester community came to the
department

02:26:58.950 --> 02:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to apply for this federal
 
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
grant because they were applying for two
 
02:27:04.790 --> 02:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
grants and they needed the state to be
 
02:27:07.670 --> 02:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
the state medicaid program to be the if
 
02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
you were the lead applicant
 
02:27:12.870 --> 02:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
in it so um in large measure the funding
 
02:27:16.790 --> 02:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
goes to the lead agency which was
 
02:27:19.110 --> 02:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
if you will drafted from the greater
 
02:27:20.550 --> 02:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
manchester medical community and that's
 
02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
elliott hospital
 
02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
there then would subcontract with other
 
02:27:27.270 --> 02:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
medical providers in their um their
 
02:27:28.630 --> 02:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
community and this is
 
02:27:31.510 --> 02:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
not for direct services it's for the
 
02:27:33.270 --> 02:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
coordination and development of
 
02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:34.070 align:start position:0%
coordination and development of
follow-up

02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:27:36.389 --> 02:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
an ordinary for example mom might get
 
02:27:38.150 --> 02:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
six months of follow-up the idea here is
 
02:27:38.790 --> 02:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
it'd be
 
02:27:41.190 --> 02:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
two years of follow-up to help make sure
 
02:27:42.070 --> 02:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
that if
 
02:27:43.750 --> 02:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
they're on the right track and remaining
 
02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:45.590 align:start position:0%
they're on the right track and remaining
free

02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
free
 
02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
abuse so the follow-up uh
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
implies that they're getting some sort
 
02:27:52.389 --> 02:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
of a counseling service
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
if for no other reason than to find out
 
02:27:55.830 --> 02:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
what their
 
02:27:59.270 --> 02:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
what their drug status is they may be
 
02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
um receiving a counseling service but
 
02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
that's not what this money's paying for
 
02:28:03.429 --> 02:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
02:28:07.110 --> 02:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
it's the part of tracking and
 
02:28:09.830 --> 02:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
providing the care coordination to get
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
them to the various services that they
 
02:28:13.110 --> 02:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
need those services are built to
 
02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:13.990 align:start position:0%
need those services are built to
medicaid

02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:18.309 align:start position:0%
medicaid
directly

02:28:18.309 --> 02:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:20.309 --> 02:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions about
 
02:28:20.319 --> 02:28:23.190 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions about
this

02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:26.309 --> 02:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not i'm not seeing any but to
 
02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
your earlier question
 
02:28:30.870 --> 02:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh represent me was it while or you
 
02:28:33.030 --> 02:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
talking about personnel there is a
 
02:28:34.389 --> 02:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
attempt full-time
 
02:28:37.590 --> 02:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
budget line you know
 
02:28:39.510 --> 02:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay i assume that's what's paying for
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
the the help yes
 
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
and is that person employed in this
 
02:28:48.550 --> 02:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
department or borrowed
 
02:28:50.469 --> 02:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
manpower from a different department and
 
02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
this is a cost transfer
 
02:28:58.230 --> 02:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:01.190 --> 02:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
new new to the program and previously
 
02:29:02.550 --> 02:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
had worked in the department of health
 
02:29:03.750 --> 02:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
02:29:06.550 --> 02:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
but wasn't currently the position is not
 
02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:06.950 align:start position:0%
but wasn't currently the position is not
now

02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:29:21.990 --> 02:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
vacant correct very good thank you
 
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
you have something you want to make sure
 
02:29:25.510 --> 02:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
we know i think we've asked our
 
02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:27.190 align:start position:0%
we know i think we've asked our
questions

02:29:27.190 --> 02:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:29:30.990 --> 02:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
great the next accounting is
 
02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
5201 which is the idn fund as
 
02:29:36.150 --> 02:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh henry has already talked about that
 
02:29:38.070 --> 02:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
waiver has ended so this accounting unit
 
02:29:40.630 --> 02:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
is no longer budgeted
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to ask a similar question
 
02:29:45.190 --> 02:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
to the one i asked earlier
 
02:29:47.429 --> 02:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
what did we buy with this money because
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
we spent it looks like we
 
02:29:52.150 --> 02:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
spent almost 11 million in
 
02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
fy 20 and almo and budgeted 26 million
 
02:29:59.910 --> 02:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
what did we think we were getting karen
 
02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
did i address that
 
02:30:07.270 --> 02:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
yeah please henry um so i think the
 
02:30:11.190 --> 02:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
it was a five year uh uh demonstration
 
02:30:14.950 --> 02:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
um and the things that we were able to
 
02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:15.750 align:start position:0%
um and the things that we were able to
demonstrate

02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
demonstrate
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
that are be carried forward um
 
02:30:21.030 --> 02:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
are a number of different things that
 
02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
the department is
 
02:30:25.590 --> 02:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
um working on um
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
utilizing so for example um
 
02:30:32.469 --> 02:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
the years of technology for
 
02:30:34.469 --> 02:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
tracking admissions discharges and
 
02:30:35.830 --> 02:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
transfers so that
 
02:30:39.110 --> 02:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
when for example someone is admitted to
 
02:30:41.990 --> 02:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
the state hospital
 
02:30:45.190 --> 02:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
and that there be notification to their
 
02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
provider that they've been
 
02:30:48.630 --> 02:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
admitted or if they're going to be
 
02:30:48.640 --> 02:30:50.710 align:start position:0%
admitted or if they're going to be
discharged

02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
discharged
 
02:30:54.230 --> 02:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's a technology that is
 
02:30:57.510 --> 02:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
widely used by the mcos the
 
02:31:00.469 --> 02:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
various medical providers and you know
 
02:31:03.510 --> 02:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
that being an example of where
 
02:31:06.150 --> 02:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
acting sooner on admissions and
 
02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
discharges prevent
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
readmissions the state hospital
 
02:31:15.429 --> 02:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
allow for um connection to their regular
 
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
provider to
 
02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
coordinate medical information to be
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
able to to provide
 
02:31:24.950 --> 02:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
um better coordination of care to reduce
 
02:31:27.429 --> 02:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
length to stay or reduce readmissions
 
02:31:29.190 --> 02:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
that's kind of one track of things
 
02:31:30.710 --> 02:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
a technology and a process another thing
 
02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:34.630 align:start position:0%
a technology and a process another thing
was

02:31:34.630 --> 02:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:31:37.270 --> 02:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
the employment and expansion of
 
02:31:38.950 --> 02:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
providers to treat substance use
 
02:31:38.960 --> 02:31:39.830 align:start position:0%
providers to treat substance use
disorder

02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
02:31:43.030 --> 02:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
there was some 300
 
02:31:47.030 --> 02:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
expansion of providers that treated
 
02:31:50.710 --> 02:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
sud there was coordination
 
02:31:54.150 --> 02:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
with for example the correctional system
 
02:31:56.070 --> 02:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
in some counties that
 
02:31:59.270 --> 02:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
to once the treatment was
 
02:32:02.710 --> 02:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
for example for sud was done in the
 
02:32:04.710 --> 02:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
prison system to carry forward their
 
02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:05.910 align:start position:0%
prison system to carry forward their
coordination

02:32:05.910 --> 02:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
coordination
 
02:32:08.070 --> 02:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
once they leave the prison system so a
 
02:32:12.710 --> 02:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
lot of different features to
 
02:32:15.910 --> 02:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
improve care coordination to improve
 
02:32:19.270 --> 02:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
transitions of care to increase the
 
02:32:24.070 --> 02:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
capacity of the labor workforce
 
02:32:26.389 --> 02:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
those are just some of the things that
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
we've got from this i think that
 
02:32:32.230 --> 02:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
you know care coordination and care
 
02:32:33.590 --> 02:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
management are
 
02:32:37.110 --> 02:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
are important aspects of of
 
02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
of what happens to control um costs
 
02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
and to for example in the earlier
 
02:32:45.429 --> 02:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
analogy someone who's using the
 
02:32:47.590 --> 02:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
emergency room
 
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
you know tens of maybe even hundreds of
 
02:32:50.870 --> 02:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
times that
 
02:32:53.990 --> 02:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
being able to provide insight to to
 
02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
different uh
 
02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
parts of the health care system to be
 
02:32:58.790 --> 02:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
able to intervene
 
02:33:00.469 --> 02:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
to get them to the right level the right
 
02:33:02.710 --> 02:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
care at the right time right place
 
02:33:05.270 --> 02:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
right cost if that's helpful
 
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative edwards oh
 
02:33:09.990 --> 02:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
it is it's it's uh you you told me more
 
02:33:11.349 --> 02:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
than i thought i
 
02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
was asking and that was helpful um i
 
02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
guess my last question here is
 
02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh we in the budget for this year we
 
02:33:21.710 --> 02:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
thought we were going to spend
 
02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
3.3 million dollars and
 
02:33:27.030 --> 02:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
that there was a 10 million dollar local
 
02:33:27.040 --> 02:33:28.150 align:start position:0%
that there was a 10 million dollar local
funds

02:33:28.150 --> 02:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:33:30.550 --> 02:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh i'm curious what those local funds
 
02:33:30.560 --> 02:33:31.190 align:start position:0%
uh i'm curious what those local funds
are

02:33:31.190 --> 02:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
and if both those budget amounts are
 
02:33:34.950 --> 02:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:33:36.870 --> 02:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
spent or if they're going to be
 
02:33:36.880 --> 02:33:39.030 align:start position:0%
spent or if they're going to be
underspin

02:33:39.030 --> 02:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
underspin
 
02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
so this is a bit of a complicated
 
02:33:42.710 --> 02:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
question representative edwards but let
 
02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:43.190 align:start position:0%
question representative edwards but let
me

02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
try to keep it simple here um part of
 
02:33:48.070 --> 02:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
the financing of this waiver came
 
02:33:52.070 --> 02:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
from county contributions and
 
02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
obviously because of the pandemic
 
02:33:54.160 --> 02:33:56.150 align:start position:0%
obviously because of the pandemic
counties

02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
counties
 
02:33:58.230 --> 02:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
are having some of their own financial
 
02:33:59.429 --> 02:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
challenges so
 
02:34:02.389 --> 02:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
some of what we expected to be able to
 
02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
obtain as the non-federal share
 
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
were not expecting to obtain any further
 
02:34:09.349 --> 02:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
funds from the counties
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
so against a waiver that at one point
 
02:34:13.990 --> 02:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
could have been
 
02:34:16.389 --> 02:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
110 million dollars it's probably going
 
02:34:20.309 --> 02:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
to be closer to 75 or 80.
 
02:34:23.590 --> 02:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
okay and so we are going to understand
 
02:34:25.429 --> 02:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to how about the general
 
02:34:27.110 --> 02:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
funds are you are we
 
02:34:30.389 --> 02:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
returning some amount of that to the
 
02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
treasury well there there aren't um
 
02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
the way this waiver was structured we
 
02:34:37.429 --> 02:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
were receiving money for
 
02:34:40.469 --> 02:34:40.479 align:start position:0%
um in certain programs um
 
02:34:42.550 --> 02:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
in the department in behavioral health
 
02:34:43.830 --> 02:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
public health
 
02:34:47.670 --> 02:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
where the feds gave us money for
 
02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
areas that they would not otherwise
 
02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
typically match and
 
02:34:54.790 --> 02:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
so in in other parts of the budget we're
 
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
gonna have to make up for the fact those
 
02:34:57.750 --> 02:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
funds will no longer be coming to us
 
02:34:58.389 --> 02:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
they were
 
02:35:01.110 --> 02:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
expected to be temporarily um and that's
 
02:35:03.270 --> 02:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
what they are
 
02:35:05.830 --> 02:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
i think what i just heard you say is yes
 
02:35:08.070 --> 02:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend the full 3.3
 
02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:09.030 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend the full 3.3
million

02:35:09.030 --> 02:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:35:11.110 --> 02:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
and because we didn't match enough on
 
02:35:12.389 --> 02:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
the federal money
 
02:35:13.830 --> 02:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to come up with some
 
02:35:15.590 --> 02:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
more money in this budget year to
 
02:35:18.309 --> 02:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
transfer over
 
02:35:23.590 --> 02:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
um henry can i can i jump in
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
so as far as fiscal year 21. i don't
 
02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
think that we're going to expend all
 
02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
that 3.2 but what i can tell you is that
 
02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
we have shortfalls elsewhere in the
 
02:35:32.950 --> 02:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
department that we're transferring
 
02:35:35.349 --> 02:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
general funds around but our overall
 
02:35:37.590 --> 02:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
lapse for dhhs is expected to be in
 
02:35:39.349 --> 02:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
excess of 75 million dollars
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 21. um as far as 22 and
 
02:35:45.590 --> 02:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
23 this gets back to a question
 
02:35:47.750 --> 02:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
that representative earth asked and is
 
02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
still an outstanding item that i'm
 
02:35:49.990 --> 02:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
working on
 
02:35:52.389 --> 02:35:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh which was a behavioral health
 
02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
question and
 
02:35:55.270 --> 02:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
the general funds had increased and the
 
02:35:56.870 --> 02:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
question was why did the general funds
 
02:35:58.309 --> 02:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
increase what happened to the federal
 
02:35:58.319 --> 02:35:59.110 align:start position:0%
increase what happened to the federal
funds

02:35:59.110 --> 02:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
this that was related to this program so
 
02:36:03.270 --> 02:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
the general funds that are budgeted here
 
02:36:05.190 --> 02:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 21
 
02:36:09.030 --> 02:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
are budgeted elsewhere and 22 and 23.
 
02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
i think what henry is also saying is
 
02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
because this was a half of the year
 
02:36:14.550 --> 02:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
this is only half of the year the
 
02:36:16.309 --> 02:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
general funds that were moved elsewhere
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
however uh in fiscal year 21 those
 
02:36:21.110 --> 02:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
behavioral health contracts would have
 
02:36:22.469 --> 02:36:22.479 align:start position:0%
been budgeted knowing
 
02:36:25.750 --> 02:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
that the uh waiver was ending so there's
 
02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
not additional funds
 
02:36:29.349 --> 02:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
general funds needed um but these
 
02:36:32.070 --> 02:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
general funds will be moved elsewhere
 
02:36:35.030 --> 02:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay all right well that was that that
 
02:36:35.750 --> 02:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
was more
 
02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
what i was expecting to hear that kind
 
02:36:39.510 --> 02:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
of an answer uh
 
02:36:41.670 --> 02:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
fundamentally i'm just looking at 26
 
02:36:43.030 --> 02:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars and it was a
 
02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:43.910 align:start position:0%
million dollars and it was a
demonstration

02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
demonstration
 
02:36:46.550 --> 02:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
project but i'm i wonder what was
 
02:36:48.790 --> 02:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that was worth 26 million
 
02:36:50.469 --> 02:36:50.479 align:start position:0%
dollars but
 
02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
we can go on okay right the next
 
02:36:56.309 --> 02:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
accounting unit is 7937 which is
 
02:36:56.319 --> 02:36:56.950 align:start position:0%
accounting unit is 7937 which is
medicaid

02:36:56.950 --> 02:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:36:59.110 --> 02:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
administration this is where the
 
02:37:00.710 --> 02:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
medicaid employees are budgeted
 
02:37:05.110 --> 02:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
including the mmis employees
 
02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:06.850 align:start position:0%
and karen also the
 
02:37:06.850 --> 02:37:08.550 align:start position:0%
and karen also the
[Music]

02:37:08.550 --> 02:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
the transfer to other state agencies
 
02:37:13.270 --> 02:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
being in the state hospital with the
 
02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:14.309 align:start position:0%
being in the state hospital with the
dish

02:37:14.309 --> 02:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
dish
 
02:37:17.510 --> 02:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
yes yes the line 49 is the transfer to
 
02:37:18.070 --> 02:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:37:21.349 --> 02:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
hospital their dish payment is reflected
 
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
there so
 
02:37:23.830 --> 02:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire hospital they receive
 
02:37:25.590 --> 02:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
it as other income
 
02:37:27.349 --> 02:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
it's received as federal income here in
 
02:37:34.230 --> 02:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take a second and look at
 
02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
this are there any oh lots of questions
 
02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative waller um on that line
 
02:37:46.469 --> 02:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
karen on the transfer
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
why is it so much more what what's the
 
02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:50.230 align:start position:0%
why is it so much more what what's the
increase

02:37:50.230 --> 02:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:37:53.110 --> 02:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
what's causing that increase athena can
 
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
you speak to that at all or would we
 
02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:54.950 align:start position:0%
you speak to that at all or would we
just

02:37:54.950 --> 02:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:37:57.349 --> 02:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
what we need to get that info from joe
 
02:37:58.150 --> 02:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
yeah that's
 
02:37:59.910 --> 02:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's something that we budget based on
 
02:38:02.469 --> 02:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
joe's projections
 
02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
symbol are you making that line 49 is
 
02:38:07.030 --> 02:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
that the line we're talking about
 
02:38:10.950 --> 02:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
yes okay and that line 49 is 100
 
02:38:13.510 --> 02:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
federal there are no general funds in
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
that line
 
02:38:17.349 --> 02:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
because the the match to the federal
 
02:38:18.870 --> 02:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
funds for new hampshire hospital are
 
02:38:20.630 --> 02:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
essentially in kind it's the general
 
02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
funds that are spent at new hampshire
 
02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:23.510 align:start position:0%
funds that are spent at new hampshire
hospital

02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
02:38:25.030 --> 02:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
and actually dish doesn't have a general
 
02:38:26.550 --> 02:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
fund match now that i
 
02:38:29.670 --> 02:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
say that out loud okay so
 
02:38:32.710 --> 02:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
the 14 million dollar increase
 
02:38:34.389 --> 02:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
i mean that's great if it's 14 million
 
02:38:36.469 --> 02:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
dollar increase in federal funds
 
02:38:38.950 --> 02:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
i just wondered why what what was the
 
02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
formula what caused it to
 
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
increase so much why why did the federal
 
02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
government decide
 
02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
to increase that so much i don't think
 
02:38:50.309 --> 02:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
it's based on the federal government
 
02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's based on a calculation of
 
02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care so
 
02:38:55.349 --> 02:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
what i'll do jonah if you can just put
 
02:38:56.950 --> 02:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
that on the questions i'll make sure to
 
02:38:57.750 --> 02:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
have joe
 
02:38:59.910 --> 02:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
um provide that information as to the
 
02:38:59.920 --> 02:39:01.910 align:start position:0%
um provide that information as to the
increase

02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any more follow-ups
 
02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:06.389 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any more follow-ups
representative

02:39:06.389 --> 02:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:39:12.710 --> 02:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:14.230 --> 02:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
if i could just back up for a moment
 
02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:16.309 align:start position:0%
if i could just back up for a moment
karen

02:39:16.309 --> 02:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
karen
 
02:39:18.550 --> 02:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
1371 did that exist in the previous
 
02:39:23.110 --> 02:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:26.469 --> 02:39:26.479 align:start position:0%
the maternal opioid misuse uh it only
 
02:39:28.389 --> 02:39:28.399 align:start position:0%
existed when it was created when they
 
02:39:30.389 --> 02:39:30.399 align:start position:0%
we accepted the grant funds it was not
 
02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
created during the budget process
 
02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
i think we tried to create it during the
 
02:39:36.389 --> 02:39:36.399 align:start position:0%
budget process and kevin told me i was
 
02:39:37.670 --> 02:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
too late
 
02:39:40.630 --> 02:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
if i recall correctly we got the grant
 
02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
award i want to say
 
02:39:45.030 --> 02:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
super late in that second year
 
02:39:46.870 --> 02:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah oh so we were actually in the
 
02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
continuing resolution
 
02:39:52.710 --> 02:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
that was a federal fund grant is it yes
 
02:39:53.190 --> 02:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:39:56.790 --> 02:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:56.800 --> 02:40:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
weiler

02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:05.670 --> 02:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
you're on mute sir the next
 
02:40:08.830 --> 02:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
you show editions of one classified and
 
02:40:12.550 --> 02:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
unclassified with 22 and 23.
 
02:40:14.710 --> 02:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
is that because of the increases in
 
02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
things or
 
02:40:19.590 --> 02:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
who would we add unclassified
 
02:40:21.830 --> 02:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
athena do you know which uh position was
 
02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
which unclassified position was that
 
02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
brooks position that was transferred
 
02:40:29.269 --> 02:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
i believe it was brooks yes okay so
 
02:40:30.550 --> 02:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
it came from somewhere else in the
 
02:40:32.230 --> 02:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
budget i don't remember what that who
 
02:40:33.910 --> 02:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
held that position before her it might
 
02:40:34.309 --> 02:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
have been
 
02:40:38.389 --> 02:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:42.230 --> 02:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
um as far as the permanent position
 
02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
increase is that moving from somewhere
 
02:40:47.030 --> 02:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
else or is that the conversion
 
02:40:50.150 --> 02:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
because we abolished a position
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that's actually a number of things
 
02:40:56.550 --> 02:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:59.750 --> 02:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
you're you're fading out um the last
 
02:41:01.830 --> 02:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
few seconds was just completely faded
 
02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:02.870 align:start position:0%
few seconds was just completely faded
out

02:41:02.870 --> 02:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
sorry is that better oh yeah okay good
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
so uh part of that are the mmis
 
02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
positions that were previously
 
02:41:14.710 --> 02:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
unfunded in 20 and 21 in addition to
 
02:41:17.269 --> 02:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
we also moved in two or three other mmis
 
02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
positions that should have been moved in
 
02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:20.389 align:start position:0%
positions that should have been moved in
2021

02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
2021
 
02:41:22.670 --> 02:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
they were unfunded we moved them in in
 
02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:24.710 align:start position:0%
they were unfunded we moved them in in
22-23

02:41:24.710 --> 02:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
22-23
 
02:41:28.070 --> 02:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you no more follow-up there
 
02:41:31.030 --> 02:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative no thanks all right
 
02:41:35.750 --> 02:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:39.429 --> 02:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you so on
 
02:41:44.630 --> 02:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
line 102 contract for program services
 
02:41:46.630 --> 02:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's increased by about five million
 
02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
dollars i was wondering
 
02:41:52.790 --> 02:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
what new contracts or what is that sure
 
02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:53.590 align:start position:0%
what new contracts or what is that sure
so

02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:57.590 --> 02:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
this is um contract funds that really
 
02:41:59.990 --> 02:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
are to support the entire department but
 
02:42:01.590 --> 02:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
i anticipate that it will come from
 
02:42:01.600 --> 02:42:02.309 align:start position:0%
i anticipate that it will come from
medicaid

02:42:02.309 --> 02:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
at administration funding so i put it
 
02:42:07.110 --> 02:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
all here but these would be the contract
 
02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:07.750 align:start position:0%
all here but these would be the contract
funds

02:42:07.750 --> 02:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:42:10.790 --> 02:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
to support the transformation projects
 
02:42:13.349 --> 02:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2. so the funds in house
 
02:42:14.070 --> 02:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
bill 2
 
02:42:15.990 --> 02:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
the 10 million dollars in general funds
 
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
with with the authority to accept any
 
02:42:20.870 --> 02:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh federal funds those are to pay for
 
02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:21.349 align:start position:0%
uh federal funds those are to pay for
the

02:42:21.349 --> 02:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:42:24.070 --> 02:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
projects themselves right to implement
 
02:42:24.870 --> 02:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
the it
 
02:42:28.550 --> 02:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
processes to hire temporary employees
 
02:42:31.349 --> 02:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
this fund is to hire a contractor to
 
02:42:32.550 --> 02:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
help us support
 
02:42:36.389 --> 02:42:36.399 align:start position:0%
that transformation so project manage
 
02:42:39.670 --> 02:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
and and research and analysis and all of
 
02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:46.309 --> 02:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up great yeah uh so karen
 
02:42:49.110 --> 02:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
are you talking about in house bill 2
 
02:42:50.630 --> 02:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
are you talking about
 
02:42:53.990 --> 02:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
the alvarez and marcel
 
02:42:56.630 --> 02:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
the the contract with them is that what
 
02:42:57.750 --> 02:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
02:42:59.910 --> 02:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
so the 10 million dollars that's in hb2
 
02:43:01.830 --> 02:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
is not to contract with
 
02:43:05.030 --> 02:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
alvarez and marcel it's to implement the
 
02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
projects that alvarez and
 
02:43:09.349 --> 02:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
marcel is suggesting we implement which
 
02:43:09.359 --> 02:43:10.150 align:start position:0%
marcel is suggesting we implement which
is

02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:43:14.150 --> 02:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
the um the imd waiver
 
02:43:17.269 --> 02:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
and the uh the projects within
 
02:43:19.030 --> 02:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
behavioral health as well as the
 
02:43:22.309 --> 02:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
dd system uh transformations
 
02:43:25.590 --> 02:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
that so that's for the actual department
 
02:43:27.670 --> 02:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
cost of making those changes
 
02:43:30.150 --> 02:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
and this is to hire a contractor whether
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
it's alvarez marcel or another
 
02:43:34.389 --> 02:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
contractor to help us to help support us
 
02:43:37.190 --> 02:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
in making those transitions
 
02:43:42.950 --> 02:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:47.030 --> 02:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
so um this is an addition this is a new
 
02:43:48.870 --> 02:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars
 
02:43:54.070 --> 02:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
to do the things that alvarez and marcel
 
02:43:55.830 --> 02:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
had in their review
 
02:43:59.349 --> 02:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
yes so if
 
02:44:02.870 --> 02:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
if i'm following this
 
02:44:06.950 --> 02:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
then that is 10 million dollars
 
02:44:11.349 --> 02:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:14.550 --> 02:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
we spent last year but last year we
 
02:44:15.670 --> 02:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
spent 7
 
02:44:18.469 --> 02:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
800 in the year before we sent 5 million
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
so there's only 2 million
 
02:44:23.590 --> 02:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
700 left what are we what aren't we
 
02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:24.710 align:start position:0%
700 left what are we what aren't we
doing

02:44:24.710 --> 02:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:44:26.870 --> 02:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
if we took the 10 million out for the
 
02:44:28.230 --> 02:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
for the alvarez and
 
02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
marcel we would have 2 million left
 
02:44:35.030 --> 02:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
what are we not doing nope so the
 
02:44:37.510 --> 02:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
the funds in addition here the 7 million
 
02:44:38.389 --> 02:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
to 12 million
 
02:44:41.830 --> 02:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
is about uh 6 million a year
 
02:44:43.910 --> 02:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
the 10 million that i was talking about
 
02:44:45.110 --> 02:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
is an hb2
 
02:44:47.110 --> 02:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
this is a separate appropriation the 6
 
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
million in hb1
 
02:44:55.590 --> 02:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:57.750 --> 02:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
okay just less than the 7.8 really
 
02:44:59.590 --> 02:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
bringing it back in line to
 
02:45:01.830 --> 02:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
what we actually spent around six a
 
02:45:04.469 --> 02:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
little over six
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up um i'm just i'm
 
02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:09.110 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up um i'm just i'm
just

02:45:09.110 --> 02:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:45:14.230 --> 02:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
thinking about it for a minute um we get
 
02:45:15.030 --> 02:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
a list
 
02:45:18.469 --> 02:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
of what exactly we're doing with um
 
02:45:20.150 --> 02:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
with the 10 million dollars that's in
 
02:45:22.230 --> 02:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 2.
 
02:45:24.870 --> 02:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
sure what i can do is provide a an
 
02:45:26.389 --> 02:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
explanation of our plan
 
02:45:28.469 --> 02:45:28.479 align:start position:0%
the part of the problem is that we still
 
02:45:30.070 --> 02:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
have planning to do
 
02:45:33.349 --> 02:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
um and so the what you'll see in the
 
02:45:36.150 --> 02:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
alvarez marcel report are ranges
 
02:45:38.630 --> 02:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
to implement many of these things and
 
02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:39.429 align:start position:0%
to implement many of these things and
for

02:45:39.429 --> 02:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:45:42.070 --> 02:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
many of them we chose a number that was
 
02:45:44.150 --> 02:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
sort of in the middle of the range
 
02:45:46.230 --> 02:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
but the reason part of the reason that
 
02:45:47.510 --> 02:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's in hb2 and
 
02:45:49.830 --> 02:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
and matt the governor's budget director
 
02:45:51.110 --> 02:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
alluded to this
 
02:45:53.269 --> 02:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
is that we're not sure exactly where
 
02:45:55.030 --> 02:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
everything is going to land so the
 
02:45:56.469 --> 02:45:56.479 align:start position:0%
governor's office was trying to give us
 
02:45:58.230 --> 02:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
some flexibility to say you need to
 
02:46:00.070 --> 02:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
implement all of these things
 
02:46:03.269 --> 02:46:03.279 align:start position:0%
but it could be that um implementing the
 
02:46:05.269 --> 02:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
imd waiver ends up a little more
 
02:46:07.429 --> 02:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
expensive than we anticipated but one of
 
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
the other things that we're implementing
 
02:46:10.309 --> 02:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
ends up costing a little bit less
 
02:46:12.389 --> 02:46:12.399 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason that they put it in
 
02:46:13.590 --> 02:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
hb2 to offer
 
02:46:15.429 --> 02:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
us some flexibility around that but i
 
02:46:17.190 --> 02:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
can definitely give you
 
02:46:19.030 --> 02:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
um the projects that we're looking to
 
02:46:22.870 --> 02:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
implement with that with those funds
 
02:46:25.510 --> 02:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome so i have a
 
02:46:27.349 --> 02:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
question for mr ripple and then we'll go
 
02:46:27.359 --> 02:46:27.750 align:start position:0%
question for mr ripple and then we'll go
to

02:46:27.750 --> 02:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:46:30.870 --> 02:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
um uh representative weiler nerf so
 
02:46:34.230 --> 02:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
so mr ripple this weekend as you were
 
02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:34.790 align:start position:0%
so mr ripple this weekend as you were
working

02:46:34.790 --> 02:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:46:37.670 --> 02:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
hard during the weekend your off hours
 
02:46:39.750 --> 02:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
one of the emails that you sent me
 
02:46:42.150 --> 02:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
sounded like you were going to take the
 
02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:43.110 align:start position:0%
sounded like you were going to take the
hb2

02:46:43.110 --> 02:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
items and put it into a spreadsheet so
 
02:46:47.030 --> 02:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
that we could
 
02:46:49.510 --> 02:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
see where we thought those hp2 items
 
02:46:51.990 --> 02:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
were lining up
 
02:46:55.750 --> 02:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
so are you are you going to be
 
02:47:01.990 --> 02:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:05.110 --> 02:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
aggregate or gross uh allocation
 
02:47:07.910 --> 02:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
against any of these budget areas or are
 
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
you just going to do an overall
 
02:47:12.389 --> 02:47:12.399 align:start position:0%
here's 10 million dollars associated
 
02:47:13.429 --> 02:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
with a m
 
02:47:18.710 --> 02:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:20.790 --> 02:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
i was going to do an overall because the
 
02:47:22.070 --> 02:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars for
 
02:47:23.830 --> 02:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
alvarez and marcel for example i don't
 
02:47:25.190 --> 02:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
know where that would be distributed
 
02:47:26.550 --> 02:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
throughout the department
 
02:47:28.150 --> 02:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh so at this point i don't think i have
 
02:47:30.150 --> 02:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
the information to align it with
 
02:47:33.670 --> 02:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:34.950 --> 02:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank units for that and that's going to
 
02:47:37.190 --> 02:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
be a helpful spreadsheet i think so
 
02:47:39.990 --> 02:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative weiler oh thank you i've
 
02:47:41.429 --> 02:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
heard this
 
02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
ind waiver ind waiver a few times and
 
02:47:44.550 --> 02:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
i've never
 
02:47:47.190 --> 02:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
i didn't find it in the list of acronyms
 
02:47:48.150 --> 02:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
what does it
 
02:47:50.710 --> 02:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
stand for oh i will have to ask john to
 
02:47:52.710 --> 02:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
add a to the list of acronyms henry do
 
02:47:53.349 --> 02:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
you want to
 
02:47:56.630 --> 02:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
yeah it's institutions of medical uh
 
02:47:59.750 --> 02:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
mental disease that um the
 
02:48:02.870 --> 02:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
feds as you know representative weiler
 
02:48:04.950 --> 02:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
you know when someone's admitted to the
 
02:48:07.030 --> 02:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
state hospital as an example that
 
02:48:08.950 --> 02:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
they limit the amount that they pay in
 
02:48:10.950 --> 02:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
the rest of that obligation
 
02:48:14.550 --> 02:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
um rests with the state in general funds
 
02:48:17.670 --> 02:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
what the imd waiver would allow is for
 
02:48:20.150 --> 02:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
the state to be able to access
 
02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
additional federal fund matching um for
 
02:48:23.590 --> 02:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
care of people
 
02:48:26.870 --> 02:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
who are admitted to different facilities
 
02:48:29.110 --> 02:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
including the state hospital
 
02:48:30.630 --> 02:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
thank you i guess i was looking it up
 
02:48:32.469 --> 02:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
wrong because i thought i
 
02:48:35.990 --> 02:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
ampersand d or i november d
 
02:48:39.349 --> 02:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
but uh i didn't look at them but on imd
 
02:48:41.349 --> 02:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
i kept hearing it as i nd
 
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mike delta yeah
 
02:48:47.510 --> 02:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
indiana mike delta okay representative
 
02:48:49.510 --> 02:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up sir
 
02:48:51.670 --> 02:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
no i don't thank you representative
 
02:48:51.680 --> 02:48:53.830 align:start position:0%
no i don't thank you representative
verve

02:48:53.830 --> 02:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
verve
 
02:48:56.309 --> 02:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you it's m i thought it was a
 
02:48:58.389 --> 02:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
nancy that's not my question but
 
02:49:01.830 --> 02:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
listen okay
 
02:49:04.309 --> 02:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
um so my question is on that line 102
 
02:49:05.429 --> 02:49:05.439 align:start position:0%
that you've been talking about contrast
 
02:49:06.469 --> 02:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
for program services
 
02:49:09.590 --> 02:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
is that all federal funds i believe it's
 
02:49:11.269 --> 02:49:11.279 align:start position:0%
50 50 athena
 
02:49:18.389 --> 02:49:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:20.550 --> 02:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
questions at this point do you remember
 
02:49:23.510 --> 02:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:27.469 --> 02:49:27.479 align:start position:0%
okay so the next accounting unit is uh
 
02:49:29.990 --> 02:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
79.39 which is
 
02:49:33.269 --> 02:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
the state phase down or uh dual
 
02:49:33.279 --> 02:49:34.469 align:start position:0%
the state phase down or uh dual
eligibles

02:49:34.469 --> 02:49:34.479 align:start position:0%
eligibles
 
02:49:38.550 --> 02:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
um that the state is required
 
02:49:41.670 --> 02:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
to fund uh this is a hundred percent
 
02:49:45.110 --> 02:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:47.910 --> 02:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
there is a prioritized need around this
 
02:49:49.030 --> 02:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
so what i would tell you
 
02:49:51.110 --> 02:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
and henry could give you some background
 
02:49:53.190 --> 02:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
on what the program is but
 
02:49:55.830 --> 02:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
um one of the complicating factors of
 
02:49:57.110 --> 02:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
this program
 
02:49:59.910 --> 02:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
is that we find out in october of the
 
02:50:01.110 --> 02:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal year that we are
 
02:50:03.269 --> 02:50:03.279 align:start position:0%
in what the rate we're going to have to
 
02:50:04.389 --> 02:50:04.399 align:start position:0%
pay is
 
02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
and so there have been traditionally
 
02:50:08.230 --> 02:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
rate uh
 
02:50:11.910 --> 02:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
increases um so we
 
02:50:14.950 --> 02:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
um we do have a prioritized need for
 
02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:15.590 align:start position:0%
um we do have a prioritized need for
that

02:50:15.590 --> 02:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:50:18.150 --> 02:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
the reason that fiscal year 20 actuals
 
02:50:18.710 --> 02:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
are so
 
02:50:21.590 --> 02:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
low is because of the enhanced fmap they
 
02:50:21.600 --> 02:50:22.070 align:start position:0%
low is because of the enhanced fmap they
process

02:50:22.070 --> 02:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:50:24.469 --> 02:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
the enhanced fmap on these expenditures
 
02:50:26.389 --> 02:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
as a credit to us
 
02:50:29.429 --> 02:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
so that is why it is 45 million and not
 
02:50:31.910 --> 02:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
closer to the 48 that i believe it was
 
02:50:35.030 --> 02:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:36.550 --> 02:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
if kind of think about it in the
 
02:50:38.389 --> 02:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
simplest terms it's
 
02:50:41.990 --> 02:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
part d um subsidy for those
 
02:50:44.070 --> 02:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
medicare beneficiaries who also qualify
 
02:50:45.030 --> 02:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
for medicaid
 
02:50:47.670 --> 02:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
dual eligible that is paying for their
 
02:50:47.680 --> 02:50:48.710 align:start position:0%
dual eligible that is paying for their
prescription

02:50:48.710 --> 02:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
02:50:52.230 --> 02:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh drug benefit and um the
 
02:50:54.309 --> 02:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
amount that the state has to be paid is
 
02:50:55.670 --> 02:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
based on a
 
02:50:58.710 --> 02:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
historical for each state
 
02:51:00.550 --> 02:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of what their historical
 
02:51:01.750 --> 02:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
spending on
 
02:51:03.750 --> 02:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals have been based on a
 
02:51:04.950 --> 02:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
trend factor
 
02:51:08.070 --> 02:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
and as as karen said we've been
 
02:51:09.349 --> 02:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
fortunate in this
 
02:51:11.349 --> 02:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
period of time to get some enhanced fmap
 
02:51:12.870 --> 02:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
to cover it but we
 
02:51:14.790 --> 02:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
depending on how long that enhanced that
 
02:51:17.349 --> 02:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
map is available in the time we did the
 
02:51:18.309 --> 02:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
budget we
 
02:51:19.750 --> 02:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
didn't know and we still don't know
 
02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
exactly how long it's going to be
 
02:51:22.230 --> 02:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
available that there would be
 
02:51:24.630 --> 02:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
a shortage um over what was in the
 
02:51:26.710 --> 02:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
governor's budget if it ended
 
02:51:30.389 --> 02:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:33.510 --> 02:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
so what what's your ballpark estimate of
 
02:51:35.590 --> 02:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
how much this is going to be short do
 
02:51:38.230 --> 02:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
you think what's what or what's our risk
 
02:51:40.070 --> 02:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
variable here what
 
02:51:43.510 --> 02:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
what might it be do you want to
 
02:51:47.110 --> 02:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
grab that one yeah so roughly in 22
 
02:51:49.990 --> 02:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's about 2 million and in 23 because
 
02:51:51.190 --> 02:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
it's compounded
 
02:51:56.550 --> 02:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:59.910 --> 02:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
but i would say as i know that general
 
02:52:02.150 --> 02:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
funds are certainly in demand
 
02:52:04.309 --> 02:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
in this budget is that one thing that
 
02:52:05.510 --> 02:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
could be very helpful
 
02:52:08.469 --> 02:52:08.479 align:start position:0%
is to add a class note here to allow us
 
02:52:11.990 --> 02:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
to carry the funds over from 22 to 23
 
02:52:14.070 --> 02:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
where the public health emergency is
 
02:52:16.790 --> 02:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
likely to go until at least december
 
02:52:19.349 --> 02:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
i think that this 48 million might be
 
02:52:19.359 --> 02:52:19.830 align:start position:0%
i think that this 48 million might be
okay

02:52:19.830 --> 02:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:52:22.389 --> 02:52:22.399 align:start position:0%
to get us through 22 and potentially
 
02:52:23.510 --> 02:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
even be
 
02:52:25.510 --> 02:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
some funds left that we could carry into
 
02:52:28.469 --> 02:52:28.479 align:start position:0%
23 and then have enough funds in 23.
 
02:52:30.630 --> 02:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
so unless you have a class note you
 
02:52:31.590 --> 02:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
can't do that
 
02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
you can't just correct
 
02:52:38.870 --> 02:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
if there's no question it it uh
 
02:52:42.630 --> 02:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
it lapses at the end of the year
 
02:52:44.550 --> 02:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
so mr ripple can you add that as
 
02:52:46.550 --> 02:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
something that we would ought to
 
02:52:51.110 --> 02:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:53.590 --> 02:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative walner you have
 
02:52:55.590 --> 02:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
02:52:59.110 --> 02:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
um yes i just wondered how many um
 
02:53:02.230 --> 02:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
people are in this would
 
02:53:05.349 --> 02:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
be dual eligible how many clients do we
 
02:53:07.429 --> 02:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
have in this area
 
02:53:10.950 --> 02:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
a little over 19 000 give you the
 
02:53:13.480 --> 02:53:13.490 align:start position:0%
number if i just look it up for a moment
 
02:53:13.490 --> 02:53:22.830 align:start position:0%
number if i just look it up for a moment
[Music]

02:53:22.830 --> 02:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:22.840 --> 02:53:26.670 align:start position:0%
 
here

02:53:26.670 --> 02:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:26.680 --> 02:53:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
2016.

02:53:29.990 --> 02:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:33.190 --> 02:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
is has it been has it been going up did
 
02:53:35.429 --> 02:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
you see an increase in this area during
 
02:53:36.950 --> 02:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
an endemic
 
02:53:40.550 --> 02:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
yes some slight increase
 
02:53:42.469 --> 02:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
it's about a thousand up i think or
 
02:53:44.070 --> 02:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
roughly that or so
 
02:53:47.510 --> 02:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
so a thousand on nineteen thousand
 
02:53:53.110 --> 02:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:53:56.550 --> 02:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:01.269 --> 02:54:01.279 align:start position:0%
so moving down to uh 7943
 
02:54:04.070 --> 02:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
this is the uncompensated care fund
 
02:54:05.429 --> 02:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
otherwise known as
 
02:54:07.990 --> 02:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
dish so there are no general funds in
 
02:54:08.790 --> 02:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
this account
 
02:54:12.550 --> 02:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
the uh the private local funds coming in
 
02:54:12.560 --> 02:54:13.190 align:start position:0%
the uh the private local funds coming in
here

02:54:13.190 --> 02:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:54:15.670 --> 02:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
is the medicaid enhancement tax that we
 
02:54:17.349 --> 02:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
receive from the department of revenue
 
02:54:17.359 --> 02:54:18.710 align:start position:0%
receive from the department of revenue
administration

02:54:18.710 --> 02:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
administration
 
02:54:20.070 --> 02:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
and the federal funds is of course
 
02:54:20.080 --> 02:54:23.269 align:start position:0%
and the federal funds is of course
medicaid

02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:25.830 --> 02:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
the reason you see a higher uh federal
 
02:54:25.840 --> 02:54:26.309 align:start position:0%
the reason you see a higher uh federal
match

02:54:26.309 --> 02:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
match
 
02:54:28.710 --> 02:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
here in fiscal year 20 is because of the
 
02:54:30.710 --> 02:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
enhanced staff map
 
02:54:36.710 --> 02:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:39.510 --> 02:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
and athena correct me if i'm wrong oh no
 
02:54:40.389 --> 02:54:40.399 align:start position:0%
never mind
 
02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
is it yep no
 
02:54:47.429 --> 02:54:47.439 align:start position:0%
is there a typo on the federal funds in
 
02:54:53.269 --> 02:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:55.269 --> 02:54:55.279 align:start position:0%
no there isn't sorry i missed that it
 
02:54:57.190 --> 02:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
was 119 million
 
02:55:00.550 --> 02:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
118 to 119. uh the audit
 
02:55:02.790 --> 02:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
fund set aside class 41 and this is true
 
02:55:04.389 --> 02:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire department never
 
02:55:07.349 --> 02:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
has any general funds in them
 
02:55:09.510 --> 02:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
so that's a very weird match right i
 
02:55:11.670 --> 02:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
mean that's almost like 49
 
02:55:15.269 --> 02:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
to 51 or even smaller so if you took out
 
02:55:17.990 --> 02:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
the 118 980 here
 
02:55:22.309 --> 02:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
um then it would be 50 50. the 118 980
 
02:55:23.349 --> 02:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
is is 100
 
02:55:23.359 --> 02:55:26.710 align:start position:0%
is is 100
federal

02:55:26.710 --> 02:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:28.630 --> 02:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
all right representative walner you have
 
02:55:30.550 --> 02:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
a question followed by representative
 
02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:34.870 align:start position:0%
a question followed by representative
weiler

02:55:34.870 --> 02:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:38.550 --> 02:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:42.150 --> 02:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh wyler private local funds where do
 
02:55:43.510 --> 02:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
they come from
 
02:55:45.349 --> 02:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
that's the medicaid enhancement tax that
 
02:55:46.630 --> 02:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
comes from the department of revenue
 
02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:49.510 align:start position:0%
comes from the department of revenue
administration

02:55:49.510 --> 02:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:53.750 --> 02:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome t as we call
 
02:55:59.269 --> 02:55:59.279 align:start position:0%
matt yes met matt
 
02:56:03.750 --> 02:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:06.870 --> 02:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
how do i'm just curious how you estimate
 
02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:07.990 align:start position:0%
how do i'm just curious how you estimate
this

02:56:07.990 --> 02:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:56:10.150 --> 02:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
on what basis are you estimating what
 
02:56:12.630 --> 02:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
the uncompensated care fund needs to be
 
02:56:12.640 --> 02:56:13.349 align:start position:0%
the uncompensated care fund needs to be
here

02:56:13.349 --> 02:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:56:16.950 --> 02:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
or wants to be so it's really based on
 
02:56:19.190 --> 02:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
the medicaid enhancement tax and and
 
02:56:20.550 --> 02:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
what the anticipated medicaid
 
02:56:22.150 --> 02:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
enhancement tax is
 
02:56:25.349 --> 02:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
because met is administered by dra they
 
02:56:28.389 --> 02:56:28.399 align:start position:0%
are primarily responsible for coming up
 
02:56:28.399 --> 02:56:28.710 align:start position:0%
are primarily responsible for coming up
with

02:56:28.710 --> 02:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:56:31.349 --> 02:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates for met we do assist
 
02:56:34.150 --> 02:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
them to give them a sense of
 
02:56:37.190 --> 02:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
what the current
 
02:56:39.190 --> 02:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
market if you will of the hospitals
 
02:56:40.790 --> 02:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
looks like what the
 
02:56:42.150 --> 02:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
you know how the current revenues might
 
02:56:44.150 --> 02:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
be affected et cetera et cetera
 
02:56:47.269 --> 02:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
um but that is where that number comes
 
02:56:47.279 --> 02:56:49.190 align:start position:0%
um but that is where that number comes
from

02:56:49.190 --> 02:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:56:52.309 --> 02:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
so with the extra people on medicaid
 
02:56:54.309 --> 02:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
because they were protected during the
 
02:56:57.110 --> 02:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic from losing eligibility
 
02:57:00.309 --> 02:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
i i would just is is that why
 
02:57:03.870 --> 02:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
we went from like 128 million and 20 to
 
02:57:07.590 --> 02:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
123 to 119
 
02:57:09.349 --> 02:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
so the higher federal funds in fiscal
 
02:57:12.469 --> 02:57:12.479 align:start position:0%
year 20 is because of the enhanced fmap
 
02:57:14.790 --> 02:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
so that was probably actually budgeted
 
02:57:18.309 --> 02:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere closer to that 123 number
 
02:57:22.150 --> 02:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
um so the reduction that you're seeing
 
02:57:26.309 --> 02:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
from 21 to 22 is really related to the
 
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic the
 
02:57:31.750 --> 02:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
the tax is set uh the tax is paid
 
02:57:34.870 --> 02:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
on the previous calendar year of when
 
02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
they pay
 
02:57:38.790 --> 02:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
so in fiscal year 22 they will be paying
 
02:57:39.429 --> 02:57:39.439 align:start position:0%
the tax
 
02:57:42.150 --> 02:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
on net patient no yeah patient service
 
02:57:42.160 --> 02:57:42.950 align:start position:0%
on net patient no yeah patient service
revenue

02:57:42.950 --> 02:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
02:57:44.790 --> 02:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
i did audit the medicaid enhancement tax
 
02:57:46.710 --> 02:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
when i worked for dra but my knowledge
 
02:57:47.990 --> 02:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
is starting to fade
 
02:57:51.190 --> 02:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
um so that would be based on
 
02:57:54.150 --> 02:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
calendar year 21 which we all know has
 
02:57:54.870 --> 02:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
had some
 
02:57:58.710 --> 02:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:00.550 --> 02:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative while are your hand is
 
02:58:04.870 --> 02:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
up sir
 
02:58:08.630 --> 02:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
hello you have a question
 
02:58:13.190 --> 02:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
no okay uh go ahead and you can continue
 
02:58:16.389 --> 02:58:16.399 align:start position:0%
okay so moving along uh
 
02:58:20.070 --> 02:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
to accounting unit 7945 is ehr
 
02:58:25.030 --> 02:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:26.710 --> 02:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
and i would dean henry or athena to
 
02:58:29.030 --> 02:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
remind me what this accounting unit
 
02:58:32.469 --> 02:58:32.479 align:start position:0%
is this goes back a ways karen um
 
02:58:35.750 --> 02:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
this was a incentive that i think was in
 
02:58:39.429 --> 02:58:39.439 align:start position:0%
came out in 2008 or 2010 for
 
02:58:42.150 --> 02:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers to adopt electronic
 
02:58:44.070 --> 02:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
medical records
 
02:58:46.630 --> 02:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
it was financed at the fed level on a 90
 
02:58:46.640 --> 02:58:47.349 align:start position:0%
it was financed at the fed level on a 90
10

02:58:47.349 --> 02:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
10
 
02:58:51.590 --> 02:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
basis 90 fed 10 state the program
 
02:58:55.590 --> 02:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
is ending what you're seeing is that the
 
02:58:58.070 --> 02:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
costs that we're carrying in 22 and 23
 
02:58:58.080 --> 02:58:58.710 align:start position:0%
costs that we're carrying in 22 and 23
are

02:58:58.710 --> 02:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:59:01.510 --> 02:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
largely related to the administration of
 
02:59:03.510 --> 02:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
the auditing and the final
 
02:59:06.710 --> 02:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
the final claims by the by the health
 
02:59:09.190 --> 02:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
care providers
 
02:59:11.670 --> 02:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
medicare medicare ran a similar program
 
02:59:11.680 --> 02:59:13.349 align:start position:0%
medicare medicare ran a similar program
basically

02:59:13.349 --> 02:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:59:18.150 --> 02:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:21.510 --> 02:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
so do we have good data from this
 
02:59:24.870 --> 02:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
payment program so that we know uh
 
02:59:27.429 --> 02:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
the extent to which the ehr has been
 
02:59:27.439 --> 02:59:27.990 align:start position:0%
the extent to which the ehr has been
implemented

02:59:27.990 --> 02:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
02:59:30.230 --> 02:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and where we still have
 
02:59:30.240 --> 02:59:31.190 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and where we still have
people

02:59:31.190 --> 02:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:59:34.710 --> 02:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
who are not on ehrs like loan providers
 
02:59:34.720 --> 02:59:35.429 align:start position:0%
who are not on ehrs like loan providers
to

02:59:35.429 --> 02:59:35.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:59:37.590 --> 02:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
is there good do we have good data
 
02:59:40.389 --> 02:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
because we had this program
 
02:59:42.630 --> 02:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
we would have good data on on those that
 
02:59:44.230 --> 02:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
participate in the program we wouldn't
 
02:59:45.750 --> 02:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily have
 
02:59:47.910 --> 02:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
a full insight into those who didn't
 
02:59:49.190 --> 02:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
ever apply for it
 
02:59:50.950 --> 02:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
but i think we could probably from the
 
02:59:52.230 --> 02:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
data that we do have
 
02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
make some good educated assessments of
 
02:59:57.750 --> 02:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
where the gaps might been
 
03:00:01.110 --> 03:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
sometime in months from now i i'd be
 
03:00:01.120 --> 03:00:02.150 align:start position:0%
sometime in months from now i i'd be
curious

03:00:02.150 --> 03:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
curious
 
03:00:05.349 --> 03:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
about our ehr penetration rate and where
 
03:00:06.710 --> 03:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
we're still
 
03:00:09.990 --> 03:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh lacking uh providers who
 
03:00:15.269 --> 03:00:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:17.030 --> 03:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
but that's that's not for this budget
 
03:00:19.269 --> 03:00:19.279 align:start position:0%
drill sure
 
03:00:23.990 --> 03:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions here
 
03:00:27.110 --> 03:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
all right i'm not seeing any we can go
 
03:00:30.950 --> 03:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay moving along to 7948
 
03:00:34.950 --> 03:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
this is uh our the department's uh
 
03:00:37.269 --> 03:00:37.279 align:start position:0%
largest accounting unit this is medicaid
 
03:00:38.630 --> 03:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
care management
 
03:00:40.630 --> 03:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
this is standard medicaid the private
 
03:00:42.790 --> 03:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
local funds in this accounting unit
 
03:00:44.309 --> 03:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
are the remainder of the medicaid
 
03:00:48.150 --> 03:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
enhancement tax that is not in
 
03:00:52.389 --> 03:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
the dish account you will also note here
 
03:00:54.070 --> 03:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
that classline 535
 
03:00:56.790 --> 03:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
and 563 are the two accounting units
 
03:00:59.910 --> 03:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
from dcy are two class lines i'm sorry
 
03:01:02.309 --> 03:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
from dcyf and those are dcyf
 
03:01:03.750 --> 03:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
expenditures that are medicaid
 
03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:04.950 align:start position:0%
expenditures that are medicaid
expenditures

03:01:04.950 --> 03:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
03:01:07.990 --> 03:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
and that is a vast majority of
 
03:01:11.990 --> 03:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
the increase in this accounting unit
 
03:01:14.230 --> 03:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
okay so there are no personnel here
 
03:01:15.590 --> 03:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
because they're all over on that
 
03:01:18.830 --> 03:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
medicaid administration line
 
03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:21.910 align:start position:0%
medicaid administration line
correct

03:01:21.910 --> 03:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:25.510 --> 03:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative walner has a question
 
03:01:29.349 --> 03:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
yes this this would be where in
 
03:01:32.230 --> 03:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
20 and 21 we would see the three and a
 
03:01:34.870 --> 03:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
half percent um
 
03:01:36.630 --> 03:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
rate increase for providers is that
 
03:01:38.790 --> 03:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
correct the three point one percent rate
 
03:01:40.630 --> 03:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
increase yes
 
03:01:43.910 --> 03:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay and so that is not care
 
03:01:46.070 --> 03:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
well we carried it i mean we didn't take
 
03:01:47.429 --> 03:01:47.439 align:start position:0%
it away from them but
 
03:01:50.550 --> 03:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
there's no new rate increase in the next
 
03:01:52.550 --> 03:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
in the next budget i believe that's what
 
03:01:53.990 --> 03:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
henry testified to yes
 
03:01:58.309 --> 03:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
so do you could you tell me
 
03:02:02.070 --> 03:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
how long had medicaid providers
 
03:02:05.349 --> 03:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
gone without a rate increase
 
03:02:08.870 --> 03:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
before last but before the biennium
 
03:02:11.030 --> 03:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
we're in now
 
03:02:12.389 --> 03:02:12.399 align:start position:0%
representative wallner thank you for the
 
03:02:15.349 --> 03:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
question um i think there'd be a variety
 
03:02:15.359 --> 03:02:15.670 align:start position:0%
question um i think there'd be a variety
of

03:02:15.670 --> 03:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:02:19.990 --> 03:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
answers like for example um hospitals
 
03:02:22.950 --> 03:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
um where i'm a bit familiar with it been
 
03:02:23.510 --> 03:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:02:26.630 --> 03:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
decades since their last increase
 
03:02:30.389 --> 03:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
for um physicians uh somewhat similar
 
03:02:33.269 --> 03:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
but it ranged from a few years to you
 
03:02:33.279 --> 03:02:33.670 align:start position:0%
but it ranged from a few years to you
know

03:02:33.670 --> 03:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:02:35.429 --> 03:02:35.439 align:start position:0%
a couple of decades potentially in some
 
03:02:35.439 --> 03:02:38.630 align:start position:0%
a couple of decades potentially in some
instances

03:02:38.630 --> 03:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:40.230 --> 03:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
like home health was another one that i
 
03:02:43.429 --> 03:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
think had some increases along the way
 
03:02:45.830 --> 03:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
but we could give you something more
 
03:02:46.870 --> 03:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
specific on that
 
03:02:50.950 --> 03:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:53.990 --> 03:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
and that rate increase is strictly a
 
03:02:56.630 --> 03:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
federal decision no that was a
 
03:03:00.070 --> 03:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
legislative decision in 2019 to provide
 
03:03:03.510 --> 03:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
two 3.1 percent increases and
 
03:03:09.590 --> 03:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:12.710 --> 03:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
so so the decision not to increase
 
03:03:16.630 --> 03:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement rate has has been
 
03:03:19.830 --> 03:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
a state legislature decision
 
03:03:22.950 --> 03:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
yes all right representative waller your
 
03:03:25.349 --> 03:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
hand is up do you have a follow-up
 
03:03:28.710 --> 03:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
yes i do um so
 
03:03:31.349 --> 03:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
could you speak for a minute as i mean i
 
03:03:32.389 --> 03:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
know we had gone
 
03:03:34.790 --> 03:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
for many many years in a number of areas
 
03:03:35.750 --> 03:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
can you speak for
 
03:03:37.349 --> 03:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
just a minute about what the
 
03:03:39.590 --> 03:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
ramifications of that were were there
 
03:03:41.910 --> 03:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
providers who actually did not accept
 
03:03:41.920 --> 03:03:43.269 align:start position:0%
providers who actually did not accept
medicaid

03:03:43.269 --> 03:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
03:03:46.550 --> 03:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
what what happened what what were some
 
03:03:47.830 --> 03:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
of the outcomes
 
03:03:52.070 --> 03:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
of not having a keeping pace with
 
03:03:54.950 --> 03:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
cost of living costs of medical care for
 
03:03:57.030 --> 03:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
our providers
 
03:03:59.030 --> 03:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
so so i think it come at it from two
 
03:04:00.790 --> 03:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
different angles one was
 
03:04:04.070 --> 03:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
um sort of access issues we
 
03:04:08.070 --> 03:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
were able to if you will satisfy
 
03:04:10.389 --> 03:04:10.399 align:start position:0%
access i think what the strong pressure
 
03:04:12.070 --> 03:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
that we got from providers
 
03:04:14.710 --> 03:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
on a legislative level i think in 2018
 
03:04:15.670 --> 03:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
and 19
 
03:04:18.309 --> 03:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
is a function of that in terms of the
 
03:04:20.070 --> 03:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
cross subsidies that
 
03:04:21.590 --> 03:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
meaning you know what you can collect
 
03:04:23.590 --> 03:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
from commercial insurance what you can
 
03:04:25.349 --> 03:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
collect from medicare that that the
 
03:04:28.389 --> 03:04:28.399 align:start position:0%
ability to cross-subsidize medicaid was
 
03:04:31.670 --> 03:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
was not uh able to be handled anymore by
 
03:04:31.680 --> 03:04:32.230 align:start position:0%
was not uh able to be handled anymore by
many

03:04:32.230 --> 03:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
many
 
03:04:34.950 --> 03:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
provider types and they needed a level
 
03:04:36.790 --> 03:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
of increase i think that
 
03:04:39.750 --> 03:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
i would note that for example in the the
 
03:04:42.230 --> 03:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
dish program for hospitals that there is
 
03:04:44.950 --> 03:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
some compensation for uncompensated uh
 
03:04:44.960 --> 03:04:45.429 align:start position:0%
some compensation for uncompensated uh
care

03:04:45.429 --> 03:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:04:47.510 --> 03:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
and that's outside of the rate increases
 
03:04:48.550 --> 03:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
03:04:51.670 --> 03:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
that continue to evolve again not
 
03:04:53.110 --> 03:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily keeping up with the full
 
03:04:55.349 --> 03:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
cost of uncompensated care
 
03:04:57.269 --> 03:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
and then nursing the county nursing
 
03:04:59.269 --> 03:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
facilities receiving
 
03:05:02.110 --> 03:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
supplemental payments in terms of the
 
03:05:02.120 --> 03:05:03.510 align:start position:0%
supplemental payments in terms of the
[Music]

03:05:03.510 --> 03:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:05:06.070 --> 03:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
m quip medicaid quality incentive
 
03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
payment and pro share that
 
03:05:09.910 --> 03:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
that helped to defray some of the the
 
03:05:11.990 --> 03:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
cost but i think it just became
 
03:05:15.190 --> 03:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
you know fairly universal um that
 
03:05:17.510 --> 03:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know the ability to support uh
 
03:05:17.520 --> 03:05:18.389 align:start position:0%
you know the ability to support uh
medicaid's

03:05:18.389 --> 03:05:18.399 align:start position:0%
medicaid's
 
03:05:20.630 --> 03:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
standalone and maintain a level of
 
03:05:22.389 --> 03:05:22.399 align:start position:0%
medicaid patients within a particular
 
03:05:23.349 --> 03:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
practice that
 
03:05:24.870 --> 03:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
i think the pressure was being felt
 
03:05:27.349 --> 03:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
there and i think the legislature also
 
03:05:27.359 --> 03:05:28.710 align:start position:0%
there and i think the legislature also
acted

03:05:28.710 --> 03:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
acted
 
03:05:31.990 --> 03:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
in 2018 i believe it was to improve
 
03:05:35.750 --> 03:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
mental health rates um which
 
03:05:37.750 --> 03:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
was carried forward into 19 and 20 and
 
03:05:39.750 --> 03:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
21 there was
 
03:05:43.030 --> 03:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
investment there and sud rates um
 
03:05:44.870 --> 03:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
those are two rates that you know where
 
03:05:46.710 --> 03:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
there was significant pressures
 
03:05:48.309 --> 03:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
um that worked that did have some
 
03:05:51.110 --> 03:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
intermediate uh help on but i think even
 
03:05:51.120 --> 03:05:51.429 align:start position:0%
intermediate uh help on but i think even
there

03:05:51.429 --> 03:05:51.439 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:05:53.830 --> 03:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
that you know continuing to sustain that
 
03:05:54.550 --> 03:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:05:57.670 --> 03:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
the transition when um if you remember
 
03:05:59.030 --> 03:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid expansion
 
03:06:01.510 --> 03:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
was originally on the exchange and so
 
03:06:03.670 --> 03:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
that the reimbursement rates for the
 
03:06:06.550 --> 03:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
expansion population at one point were
 
03:06:07.830 --> 03:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to be higher
 
03:06:10.230 --> 03:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
um and then the federal government and
 
03:06:11.750 --> 03:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
then the transition
 
03:06:14.389 --> 03:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
for the state to move back the expansion
 
03:06:16.550 --> 03:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
population into the standard program
 
03:06:19.190 --> 03:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
represented a rate cut and savings to
 
03:06:20.550 --> 03:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
the state as well
 
03:06:22.469 --> 03:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
so i think all those things combined
 
03:06:23.750 --> 03:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
together led to
 
03:06:25.429 --> 03:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
you know the provider community saying
 
03:06:26.790 --> 03:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
we need some relief here
 
03:06:28.230 --> 03:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
more than what has been able to been
 
03:06:32.870 --> 03:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:36.150 --> 03:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
for the question yes
 
03:06:39.349 --> 03:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
so mr littman when
 
03:06:42.389 --> 03:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
when providers um
 
03:06:45.590 --> 03:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
can't keep up through when medicaid does
 
03:06:46.710 --> 03:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
not keep up with
 
03:06:50.469 --> 03:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
the cost to the provider the provider
 
03:06:52.790 --> 03:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
do you think that that then gets pushed
 
03:06:54.830 --> 03:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
back into the private market
 
03:06:59.590 --> 03:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
and um the private insurance
 
03:07:01.990 --> 03:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
ends up being higher because medicaid
 
03:07:02.950 --> 03:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
has um
 
03:07:07.030 --> 03:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
been underfunded i think in part
 
03:07:10.070 --> 03:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
it does but also in part i think the
 
03:07:13.269 --> 03:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
the adjustments to the to the dish
 
03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
program for example
 
03:07:17.990 --> 03:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
um were intended to help offset that
 
03:07:21.590 --> 03:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and you know the fact that that uh
 
03:07:24.230 --> 03:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know today or at the time there's 50
 
03:07:26.309 --> 03:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
000 now 70 000 people who had no
 
03:07:26.319 --> 03:07:27.269 align:start position:0%
000 now 70 000 people who had no
insurance

03:07:27.269 --> 03:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:07:30.309 --> 03:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
um now have some level of coverage that
 
03:07:31.830 --> 03:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
those things taken together i think
 
03:07:33.429 --> 03:07:33.439 align:start position:0%
we're intended to
 
03:07:35.990 --> 03:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
help provide some relief there um albeit
 
03:07:37.110 --> 03:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
maybe not 100
 
03:07:41.510 --> 03:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
relief thank you
 
03:07:44.630 --> 03:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh so so leveraging off of what
 
03:07:46.389 --> 03:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
representative walner just said i think
 
03:07:48.630 --> 03:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
you made an offer mr lippman
 
03:07:52.230 --> 03:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
to give us a a history of the rate
 
03:07:52.240 --> 03:07:52.950 align:start position:0%
to give us a a history of the rate
increases

03:07:52.950 --> 03:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
increases
 
03:07:57.110 --> 03:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
or lack thereof um i i would like to see
 
03:07:57.120 --> 03:07:57.590 align:start position:0%
or lack thereof um i i would like to see
that

03:07:57.590 --> 03:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
and it sounded like sometimes the rate
 
03:08:02.790 --> 03:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
increases were bifurcated towards
 
03:08:04.870 --> 03:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
particular clinical areas
 
03:08:06.630 --> 03:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
if you could make that distinction if
 
03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
there is one i'd
 
03:08:11.429 --> 03:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see that i think that um
 
03:08:13.990 --> 03:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
we should be able to look to athena here
 
03:08:15.110 --> 03:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
i think we have
 
03:08:18.150 --> 03:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
records of different
 
03:08:20.469 --> 03:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
if i can go back maybe a decade or
 
03:08:22.150 --> 03:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
something like that 10 years that might
 
03:08:23.190 --> 03:08:23.200 align:start position:0%
make it
 
03:08:25.110 --> 03:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
a quicker turnaround than having to go
 
03:08:27.030 --> 03:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
back 20 or 30 years
 
03:08:29.750 --> 03:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not looking for the hard stuff to do
 
03:08:31.910 --> 03:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
but if you can do a decade pretty easily
 
03:08:33.190 --> 03:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
that's relevant
 
03:08:36.950 --> 03:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay um representative earth your hands
 
03:08:36.960 --> 03:08:38.710 align:start position:0%
okay um representative earth your hands
up

03:08:38.710 --> 03:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:08:41.750 --> 03:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you could you remind me what line
 
03:08:43.910 --> 03:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
was the dcyf included in is that five
 
03:08:45.110 --> 03:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
three five
 
03:08:48.150 --> 03:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
five three five and five six three both
 
03:08:48.870 --> 03:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
of them okay
 
03:08:55.670 --> 03:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:57.910 --> 03:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions in this
 
03:08:57.920 --> 03:08:59.429 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions in this
area

03:08:59.429 --> 03:08:59.439 align:start position:0%
area
 
03:09:08.550 --> 03:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:10.870 --> 03:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
so i guess i have the same a similar
 
03:09:10.880 --> 03:09:12.790 align:start position:0%
so i guess i have the same a similar
question

03:09:12.790 --> 03:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:09:16.230 --> 03:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
how on what just on what basis
 
03:09:20.469 --> 03:09:20.479 align:start position:0%
are we coming up with an estimate
 
03:09:24.150 --> 03:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
for say the federal funds on uh
 
03:09:27.269 --> 03:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
zero zero zero for uh medicaid
 
03:09:30.389 --> 03:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
care management i could take that one
 
03:09:30.399 --> 03:09:31.190 align:start position:0%
care management i could take that one
karen

03:09:31.190 --> 03:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
karen
 
03:09:34.229 --> 03:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
sure so i think the underlying the
 
03:09:36.790 --> 03:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
medicaid care management program is that
 
03:09:39.030 --> 03:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:09:44.790 --> 03:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
uses an actuarial firm to develop
 
03:09:47.910 --> 03:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
the expenditures and that the federal
 
03:09:49.429 --> 03:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
government has certain standards with
 
03:09:50.790 --> 03:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
respect to
 
03:09:53.269 --> 03:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
historical periods that you have to use
 
03:09:55.110 --> 03:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
and so the medicaid
 
03:09:56.950 --> 03:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
if you will expenditures to the managed
 
03:09:58.630 --> 03:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
care program
 
03:10:01.670 --> 03:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
receive quite a bit of work in their
 
03:10:01.680 --> 03:10:02.389 align:start position:0%
receive quite a bit of work in their
development

03:10:02.389 --> 03:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
development
 
03:10:06.950 --> 03:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
um looking at various spending patents
 
03:10:10.150 --> 03:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
for example pharmacy is like 18 to 20
 
03:10:11.510 --> 03:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
percent of the
 
03:10:13.670 --> 03:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
spend in the managed care program we
 
03:10:14.550 --> 03:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
03:10:16.950 --> 03:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
the actuarial firm has experts in the
 
03:10:16.960 --> 03:10:17.590 align:start position:0%
the actuarial firm has experts in the
pharmacy

03:10:17.590 --> 03:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
03:10:20.870 --> 03:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
area the to help look at what's being
 
03:10:23.110 --> 03:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
spent we have a formulary that's
 
03:10:24.790 --> 03:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
reviewed but basically
 
03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
we have to meet a certain federal
 
03:10:28.070 --> 03:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
standard in order to
 
03:10:29.990 --> 03:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
and it has to be approved by federal
 
03:10:31.590 --> 03:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
actuaries as well
 
03:10:34.229 --> 03:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
um before we can get a rate adopted and
 
03:10:35.910 --> 03:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's the basis in which we can draw a
 
03:10:36.950 --> 03:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
federal match
 
03:10:39.670 --> 03:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
that federal match is then driven off of
 
03:10:39.680 --> 03:10:42.070 align:start position:0%
that federal match is then driven off of
the

03:10:42.070 --> 03:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:44.309 --> 03:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries type so for example for
 
03:10:46.550 --> 03:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
the expansion it would be 90
 
03:10:49.590 --> 03:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
federal for um a chip for
 
03:10:52.389 --> 03:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
the higher uh reimbursement chip group
 
03:10:52.399 --> 03:10:53.030 align:start position:0%
the higher uh reimbursement chip group
it's

03:10:53.030 --> 03:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:10:56.710 --> 03:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
going to be 64. 5
 
03:10:59.750 --> 03:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the next biennium here and for the
 
03:11:02.150 --> 03:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
standard population it's 50
 
03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
um and so basically the the derivative
 
03:11:07.990 --> 03:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
of the federal match is based on what
 
03:11:10.630 --> 03:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
the actuarial expected spend pictures
 
03:11:12.469 --> 03:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
are for the population and each of those
 
03:11:15.910 --> 03:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
populations are studied separately
 
03:11:18.550 --> 03:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
so we could we so that we do have some
 
03:11:20.870 --> 03:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
levers still of controlling our spend by
 
03:11:22.309 --> 03:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
things like
 
03:11:25.510 --> 03:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
making an eligibility decision around uh
 
03:11:29.590 --> 03:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
healthy people or
 
03:11:32.150 --> 03:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
work people with the ability to go get a
 
03:11:32.160 --> 03:11:32.950 align:start position:0%
work people with the ability to go get a
job

03:11:32.950 --> 03:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
job
 
03:11:36.070 --> 03:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
putting them on medicaid eligibility or
 
03:11:38.070 --> 03:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
or if we came up with a silver bullet
 
03:11:39.910 --> 03:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
and found a way to get our pharmacy
 
03:11:41.269 --> 03:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
costs down
 
03:11:42.870 --> 03:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
those are things that we could do that
 
03:11:45.750 --> 03:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
would the actuaries would factor in
 
03:11:48.309 --> 03:11:48.319 align:start position:0%
yes as well like for example pharmacy is
 
03:11:51.510 --> 03:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
a good one where we um one of the
 
03:11:52.870 --> 03:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
one of the things that you'll find if
 
03:11:54.550 --> 03:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
you do some research on where can
 
03:11:57.190 --> 03:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
medicaid programs affect their spend is
 
03:11:57.590 --> 03:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:12:01.910 --> 03:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
moving it to a statewide pdl um
 
03:12:05.429 --> 03:12:05.439 align:start position:0%
pharmacy drug list it helps the
 
03:12:07.429 --> 03:12:07.439 align:start position:0%
it helps the state enhance its rebate
 
03:12:09.750 --> 03:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
position and also makes it easier on
 
03:12:10.870 --> 03:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
providers to
 
03:12:12.070 --> 03:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
prescribe because there's more
 
03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
consistency but other things that we we
 
03:12:15.030 --> 03:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
03:12:18.229 --> 03:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
earlier the idn as an example different
 
03:12:19.750 --> 03:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
care management intervention someone
 
03:12:19.760 --> 03:12:20.309 align:start position:0%
care management intervention someone
who's

03:12:20.309 --> 03:12:20.319 align:start position:0%
who's
 
03:12:22.309 --> 03:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
was using the er 30 times a year who's
 
03:12:24.150 --> 03:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
now using it twice a year
 
03:12:26.150 --> 03:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
um you know if you look at different
 
03:12:27.990 --> 03:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
areas of utilization that
 
03:12:31.670 --> 03:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
our biggest opportunity in
 
03:12:34.070 --> 03:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
in managing the program aside from the
 
03:12:34.790 --> 03:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
number of people
 
03:12:36.469 --> 03:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the type of people who are
 
03:12:38.150 --> 03:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
enrolled is by
 
03:12:41.190 --> 03:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh managing it so that there's a the
 
03:12:42.790 --> 03:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate utilization
 
03:12:44.229 --> 03:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
the right care the right time the right
 
03:12:46.070 --> 03:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
place that's that's where
 
03:12:47.990 --> 03:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
the from a transformation effort
 
03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
standpoint i think the department
 
03:12:51.590 --> 03:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
is trying to strengthen both what it
 
03:12:53.110 --> 03:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
does and what the provider community
 
03:12:53.120 --> 03:12:53.750 align:start position:0%
does and what the provider community
does

03:12:53.750 --> 03:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:12:56.710 --> 03:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of trying to um to if you will
 
03:12:56.720 --> 03:12:57.110 align:start position:0%
in terms of trying to um to if you will
right

03:12:57.110 --> 03:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:12:58.630 --> 03:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
position the care that's delivered
 
03:13:00.790 --> 03:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
that's our our biggest opportunity
 
03:13:02.790 --> 03:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know the when you look at the
 
03:13:04.710 --> 03:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
administrative spend versus the
 
03:13:08.229 --> 03:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
the medical spend you know 89 of the
 
03:13:11.269 --> 03:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
of the dollars here are going towards
 
03:13:13.030 --> 03:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
paying providers for the services that
 
03:13:13.990 --> 03:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
they use
 
03:13:16.309 --> 03:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
and trying to make sure that those
 
03:13:17.750 --> 03:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
services are appropriate
 
03:13:21.190 --> 03:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
um and um you know needed
 
03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
are are what's a big part of what the
 
03:13:25.190 --> 03:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
managed care
 
03:13:26.830 --> 03:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
organizations do as well as the
 
03:13:26.840 --> 03:13:28.710 align:start position:0%
organizations do as well as the
department

03:13:28.710 --> 03:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:13:30.550 --> 03:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
and then on top of that is the program
 
03:13:32.870 --> 03:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
integrity activities to make sure that
 
03:13:36.469 --> 03:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
you know the department is not
 
03:13:42.710 --> 03:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
experiencing fraud waste or abuse great
 
03:13:45.349 --> 03:13:45.359 align:start position:0%
great answer thank you uh what other
 
03:13:48.389 --> 03:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
questions are there in this area
 
03:13:51.269 --> 03:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any so you can continue
 
03:13:52.870 --> 03:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
all right great
 
03:13:55.990 --> 03:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
the next accounting unit is 70 51
 
03:13:57.510 --> 03:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
which is the child health insurance
 
03:13:59.030 --> 03:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
program which henry has
 
03:14:02.150 --> 03:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh spoke about extensively um
 
03:14:04.550 --> 03:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit is fairly new i
 
03:14:07.510 --> 03:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
believe it was new in the 2021 biennium
 
03:14:11.190 --> 03:14:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh it used to be that these expenditures
 
03:14:14.550 --> 03:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
were included within 79.48 um
 
03:14:17.110 --> 03:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
and because that accounting unit um had
 
03:14:18.950 --> 03:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
become so large and due to an audit
 
03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
finding from kpmg we now do
 
03:14:34.150 --> 03:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:35.670 --> 03:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
and athena correct me if i'm wrong but
 
03:14:38.710 --> 03:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
the agents the new agency income there
 
03:14:41.910 --> 03:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
is that no i'm going to ask you what it
 
03:14:46.389 --> 03:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:49.590 --> 03:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
so the increase in
 
03:14:51.830 --> 03:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
or the addition of the agency income are
 
03:14:54.469 --> 03:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
the drug rebates that are related to
 
03:14:57.510 --> 03:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
the chip population previously in 2021
 
03:15:01.910 --> 03:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
we had budgeted those rebates in 79.48
 
03:15:04.790 --> 03:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
but i do want to mention the increase or
 
03:15:06.950 --> 03:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
rather the decrease in the federal funds
 
03:15:08.309 --> 03:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
03:15:11.030 --> 03:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
in fed fiscal year 18 and 19 that
 
03:15:13.910 --> 03:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
federal match was 88
 
03:15:16.830 --> 03:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
in fed fiscal year 20 it was reduced to
 
03:15:16.840 --> 03:15:18.550 align:start position:0%
in fed fiscal year 20 it was reduced to
76.5

03:15:18.550 --> 03:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
76.5
 
03:15:20.870 --> 03:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
although again in 20 and 21 we're seeing
 
03:15:23.590 --> 03:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
the increased fmap here as well
 
03:15:27.349 --> 03:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
in fed fiscal year 21 that standard chip
 
03:15:30.950 --> 03:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
match goes down to 65
 
03:15:34.229 --> 03:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
55 so i
 
03:15:36.950 --> 03:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
my math is wrong because looking at fy
 
03:15:36.960 --> 03:15:37.910 align:start position:0%
my math is wrong because looking at fy
23

03:15:37.910 --> 03:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
23
 
03:15:40.870 --> 03:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
the 73 million versus the 37 million
 
03:15:42.950 --> 03:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
that doesn't look like a 55
 
03:15:46.309 --> 03:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
match 65
 
03:15:49.510 --> 03:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
65 federal but we also added some
 
03:15:56.950 --> 03:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:58.950 --> 03:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sure your math is right but it still
 
03:16:00.469 --> 03:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like we're coming up with
 
03:16:03.590 --> 03:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
our 45 percent
 
03:16:06.950 --> 03:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's 35 35 35
 
03:16:06.960 --> 03:16:10.229 align:start position:0%
it's 35 35 35
general

03:16:10.229 --> 03:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:13.110 --> 03:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
minus the drug we do here you say the
 
03:16:14.469 --> 03:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
federal match was
 
03:16:17.830 --> 03:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
five five or six five six five
 
03:16:20.150 --> 03:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
oh that's the problem right there my my
 
03:16:20.160 --> 03:16:21.269 align:start position:0%
oh that's the problem right there my my
hearing

03:16:21.269 --> 03:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:16:23.910 --> 03:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative earth do you have
 
03:16:25.429 --> 03:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
a question
 
03:16:27.030 --> 03:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
i just couldn't hear the word the one
 
03:16:31.830 --> 03:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
with rebates
 
03:16:34.790 --> 03:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
the agency income here is drug rebates
 
03:16:36.389 --> 03:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
drug rebates thank you
 
03:16:41.590 --> 03:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
you're welcome drug or vaccine
 
03:16:46.630 --> 03:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:48.870 --> 03:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up representative now
 
03:16:51.030 --> 03:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
03:16:53.349 --> 03:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i missed hearing the number
 
03:17:01.030 --> 03:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:03.190 --> 03:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
i believe henry's looking it up yeah i'm
 
03:17:04.229 --> 03:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
looking it up too
 
03:17:07.830 --> 03:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
so the the children um
 
03:17:10.950 --> 03:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
the low-income children uh
 
03:17:15.110 --> 03:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
seven 76 ninety and the the
 
03:17:18.630 --> 03:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh chip the enhanced match chip children
 
03:17:19.670 --> 03:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
are 17
 
03:17:19.680 --> 03:17:23.030 align:start position:0%
are 17
312.

03:17:23.030 --> 03:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:26.469 --> 03:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
what's the 17 000 the one where we um
 
03:17:30.790 --> 03:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
have the eligibility from 196 to 323
 
03:17:33.190 --> 03:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
of poverty that's that's where we get an
 
03:17:34.070 --> 03:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
enhanced match
 
03:17:38.389 --> 03:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:43.030 --> 03:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:44.309 --> 03:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't hear your full
 
03:17:46.150 --> 03:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
question representative no i mean who
 
03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
decided to go to that
 
03:17:51.510 --> 03:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
increased way up to 300 percent of
 
03:17:53.990 --> 03:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
poverty was that something we put in we
 
03:17:55.349 --> 03:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
put in the budget or was it something
 
03:17:56.550 --> 03:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
the feds told us
 
03:17:57.830 --> 03:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
no i think it was something that the
 
03:17:59.910 --> 03:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
state elected to do um
 
03:18:04.790 --> 03:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
probably in the 90s available
 
03:18:07.110 --> 03:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
300 percent seems it seems pretty
 
03:18:07.120 --> 03:18:08.710 align:start position:0%
300 percent seems it seems pretty
generous

03:18:08.710 --> 03:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
generous
 
03:18:11.269 --> 03:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
i think it's again i think nationally it
 
03:18:13.269 --> 03:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
averages 255.
 
03:18:16.309 --> 03:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
i think that the idea is
 
03:18:17.990 --> 03:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
i think from a policy standpoint has
 
03:18:19.590 --> 03:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
been that covering children and making
 
03:18:21.110 --> 03:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
sure they get their
 
03:18:23.910 --> 03:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
their well child care and to phrase
 
03:18:24.870 --> 03:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
costs and
 
03:18:27.190 --> 03:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
other areas of your budget later on um
 
03:18:29.190 --> 03:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
and like dcyf and
 
03:18:33.269 --> 03:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
other extended medical costs and i think
 
03:18:35.750 --> 03:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
that that was the the basis uh that it
 
03:18:37.670 --> 03:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
was adopted
 
03:18:39.349 --> 03:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
family of four off the top of your head
 
03:18:42.550 --> 03:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
what's 300 percent of bothering
 
03:18:46.550 --> 03:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
the uh so roughly about
 
03:18:48.790 --> 03:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
four i think it's around 16 000 as
 
03:18:50.950 --> 03:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
poverty right is four times sixteen
 
03:18:53.269 --> 03:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
would be about
 
03:18:56.710 --> 03:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
sixty four thousand well
 
03:18:58.630 --> 03:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
if you understand like a family
 
03:19:00.550 --> 03:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
commercial four usually it was about
 
03:19:03.429 --> 03:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
twenty some thousand
 
03:19:06.389 --> 03:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
i think for i'll have to i don't have it
 
03:19:08.070 --> 03:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
i guess off the top of my head i
 
03:19:09.750 --> 03:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
know for a single person at 16 that's
 
03:19:11.429 --> 03:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
what i was using as the
 
03:19:13.830 --> 03:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
multiplier um but you know if you look
 
03:19:15.990 --> 03:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
at what a policy cost for a family plan
 
03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:16.550 align:start position:0%
at what a policy cost for a family plan
it's

03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:19:18.870 --> 03:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
in the commercial market it's uh it's
 
03:19:20.389 --> 03:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
well over 20 000
 
03:19:23.750 --> 03:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
um and and so if you think about what
 
03:19:23.760 --> 03:19:24.630 align:start position:0%
um and and so if you think about what
the

03:19:24.630 --> 03:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:19:28.469 --> 03:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:30.469 --> 03:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
the target for someone spending in the
 
03:19:31.590 --> 03:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
on the um
 
03:19:33.910 --> 03:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
exchanges is you know somewhere between
 
03:19:35.349 --> 03:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
two and eight eight and a half percent
 
03:19:37.030 --> 03:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
of income that's
 
03:19:39.750 --> 03:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of children may not otherwise get
 
03:19:41.429 --> 03:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
covered as i think why that they go up
 
03:19:43.830 --> 03:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
to that level
 
03:19:45.670 --> 03:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
insurance companies got an awful greedy
 
03:19:50.309 --> 03:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:51.830 --> 03:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
i mean everyone is seeing it for
 
03:19:53.349 --> 03:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
themselves it's just a huge
 
03:19:57.349 --> 03:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
impact uh on on the general fund
 
03:20:00.389 --> 03:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
going from 17 million and 20
 
03:20:03.429 --> 03:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
to projected to go to 37 million and
 
03:20:03.439 --> 03:20:06.469 align:start position:0%
to projected to go to 37 million and
23.

03:20:06.469 --> 03:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:08.550 --> 03:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
it's just that's just a very large
 
03:20:10.550 --> 03:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
increase so so what
 
03:20:13.750 --> 03:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
if we were to project this out another
 
03:20:13.760 --> 03:20:14.469 align:start position:0%
if we were to project this out another
budget

03:20:14.469 --> 03:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:20:17.910 --> 03:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
term or two is is is this growth rate
 
03:20:19.510 --> 03:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
this growth rate is not going to
 
03:20:21.349 --> 03:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
continue is it
 
03:20:24.469 --> 03:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
no the increase between 22 and 23 is
 
03:20:26.309 --> 03:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
that group of chip kids that you were
 
03:20:27.429 --> 03:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
just speaking about
 
03:20:30.790 --> 03:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
they were previously budgeted in 79 48
 
03:20:32.630 --> 03:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
but again because they're eligible for
 
03:20:33.990 --> 03:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
the same enhanced
 
03:20:37.429 --> 03:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
chip f map we budgeted them in the chip
 
03:20:40.710 --> 03:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:43.349 --> 03:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of what's got my attention is an
 
03:20:45.030 --> 03:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
accounting transfer
 
03:20:48.469 --> 03:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
yes yes yeah
 
03:20:52.870 --> 03:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any
 
03:20:58.150 --> 03:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
the next accounting unit is eight zero
 
03:21:00.469 --> 03:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
zero nine which is medicaid management
 
03:21:01.510 --> 03:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
information system
 
03:21:05.269 --> 03:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
or mmis uh i believe henry spoke
 
03:21:07.830 --> 03:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
extensively about this this area does
 
03:21:09.429 --> 03:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
have a
 
03:21:13.590 --> 03:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:17.349 --> 03:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:20.389 --> 03:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
part of what you're seeing here is the
 
03:21:23.750 --> 03:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
the part of the increase is because of
 
03:21:23.760 --> 03:21:24.710 align:start position:0%
the part of the increase is because of
implementation

03:21:24.710 --> 03:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
03:21:27.990 --> 03:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
of the modular mmis that dave weeder
 
03:21:29.349 --> 03:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
spoke about earlier
 
03:21:31.670 --> 03:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
where you do have to run two systems
 
03:21:31.680 --> 03:21:32.790 align:start position:0%
where you do have to run two systems
simultaneously

03:21:32.790 --> 03:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
simultaneously
 
03:21:34.550 --> 03:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
for a period of time and so then you're
 
03:21:36.070 --> 03:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
sort of paying a little bit more for a
 
03:21:37.750 --> 03:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
period of time until you make that full
 
03:21:37.760 --> 03:21:38.790 align:start position:0%
period of time until you make that full
transition

03:21:38.790 --> 03:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
transition
 
03:21:40.389 --> 03:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
so that's why the expenditures are a
 
03:21:41.910 --> 03:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
little higher here
 
03:21:45.110 --> 03:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
um i do anticipate at you know as the
 
03:21:46.950 --> 03:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
project fully implements that we'll see
 
03:21:48.550 --> 03:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
these expenditures
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:05.990 --> 03:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative norgren
 
03:22:09.429 --> 03:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
hi good afternoon um could we
 
03:22:14.630 --> 03:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
could you indulge me to go back to 57
 
03:22:18.070 --> 03:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
7 51. um
 
03:22:22.630 --> 03:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
could we have a history of the
 
03:22:25.830 --> 03:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
increases and also
 
03:22:29.510 --> 03:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh acknowledge what income rates those
 
03:22:30.150 --> 03:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:22:33.429 --> 03:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
can we go back a few budgets
 
03:22:37.429 --> 03:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry are you speaking about 70 51
 
03:22:37.439 --> 03:22:42.469 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry are you speaking about 70 51
yes

03:22:42.469 --> 03:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:44.710 --> 03:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
i think as henry spoke about it the the
 
03:22:46.389 --> 03:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
300 goes back to the
 
03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
90s but we'll we can certainly get that
 
03:22:48.720 --> 03:22:49.670 align:start position:0%
90s but we'll we can certainly get that
information

03:22:49.670 --> 03:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:22:51.830 --> 03:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
well and i think the income levels would
 
03:22:53.190 --> 03:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
be helpful too
 
03:23:00.950 --> 03:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:04.630 --> 03:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
okay so i think we're back to
 
03:23:07.990 --> 03:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh mmis
 
03:23:11.349 --> 03:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
and in fy21
 
03:23:13.510 --> 03:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
we're at three million and i understand
 
03:23:16.150 --> 03:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of vacancies
 
03:23:19.429 --> 03:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
and a lot of borrowed manpower
 
03:23:22.790 --> 03:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
and we're going to jump to 12 million
 
03:23:26.710 --> 03:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
in fy 22 and i heard you say we're going
 
03:23:28.950 --> 03:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
to run redundant systems for a while
 
03:23:31.349 --> 03:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
until we can cut over and go live fully
 
03:23:34.229 --> 03:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
on the new system
 
03:23:36.389 --> 03:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
so um what i would mention is fiscal
 
03:23:38.710 --> 03:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
year 21 here was substantially
 
03:23:38.720 --> 03:23:39.910 align:start position:0%
year 21 here was substantially
underfunded

03:23:39.910 --> 03:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
underfunded
 
03:23:42.950 --> 03:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh it was not funded in in the phases of
 
03:23:44.229 --> 03:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
the budget as you can see
 
03:23:47.269 --> 03:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 20 is is much higher um
 
03:23:48.790 --> 03:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
general funds are much higher so we've
 
03:23:50.630 --> 03:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
actually needed to transfer funds
 
03:23:52.469 --> 03:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
into there if we haven't done it already
 
03:23:54.389 --> 03:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to before the fiscal year
 
03:23:57.670 --> 03:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
ends um so i would mention that about
 
03:23:59.269 --> 03:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21.
 
03:24:02.710 --> 03:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
i think we needed 13 million to
 
03:24:05.190 --> 03:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
to complete uh additional funds to
 
03:24:06.550 --> 03:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
complete 21
 
03:24:09.670 --> 03:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
that we had to find and um but the new
 
03:24:12.790 --> 03:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
contract anticipates that we
 
03:24:16.229 --> 03:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
will be funding um you know some of the
 
03:24:17.990 --> 03:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
what karen was talking about which i
 
03:24:20.950 --> 03:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
think is about 12 million of it
 
03:24:22.630 --> 03:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
so this number will land somewhere
 
03:24:26.950 --> 03:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
around 33 to 35 million
 
03:24:30.550 --> 03:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
okay all right well sometime after march
 
03:24:33.990 --> 03:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
25th i i would love to have a deep dive
 
03:24:35.349 --> 03:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
into this project
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
um and i don't know if it has to be a
 
03:24:39.269 --> 03:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
whole division three thing
 
03:24:42.550 --> 03:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
but i would like to see see this project
 
03:24:44.389 --> 03:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
closer because i think what's going to
 
03:24:46.630 --> 03:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
happen is the senate will take our
 
03:24:48.550 --> 03:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
budget and they're going to come back
 
03:24:50.630 --> 03:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
and so i have some time to get smarter
 
03:24:52.830 --> 03:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
here there's a lot of money and a lot of
 
03:24:55.269 --> 03:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
benefit from doing this and i'm just
 
03:24:57.750 --> 03:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
i just would like to see it if uh if we
 
03:24:57.760 --> 03:24:59.590 align:start position:0%
i just would like to see it if uh if we
could

03:24:59.590 --> 03:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:25:02.550 --> 03:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
we had done a presentation for the
 
03:25:03.990 --> 03:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
government council a business
 
03:25:04.000 --> 03:25:04.790 align:start position:0%
government council a business
presentation

03:25:04.790 --> 03:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
03:25:08.070 --> 03:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
um this last week and um so we'll be
 
03:25:09.750 --> 03:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
working on this because we have to bring
 
03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
a contract forward
 
03:25:14.550 --> 03:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
before the end of the state fiscal year
 
03:25:14.560 --> 03:25:15.110 align:start position:0%
before the end of the state fiscal year
so

03:25:15.110 --> 03:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:25:17.910 --> 03:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
we'll be putting together information
 
03:25:18.790 --> 03:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:25:21.349 --> 03:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
well thank you and certainly i don't
 
03:25:25.750 --> 03:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:27.750 --> 03:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
all right uh are there any other
 
03:25:31.110 --> 03:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:34.389 --> 03:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any are we done was that
 
03:25:34.399 --> 03:25:35.269 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any are we done was that
it

03:25:35.269 --> 03:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:25:37.590 --> 03:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh no one last one is medicaid to
 
03:25:39.349 --> 03:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
schools which is 100 federal
 
03:25:41.190 --> 03:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
which i believe you you talked a little
 
03:25:42.389 --> 03:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
bit about in
 
03:25:51.349 --> 03:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
um chris antonello's presentation uh
 
03:25:55.670 --> 03:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
so this concept of medicaid to schools
 
03:25:59.190 --> 03:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
are i i think i saw chris on earlier
 
03:26:02.550 --> 03:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
um are we are we
 
03:26:06.469 --> 03:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
actively working through the doe so that
 
03:26:10.070 --> 03:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
as they as they add uh like like in our
 
03:26:12.309 --> 03:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
local auburn village school
 
03:26:15.750 --> 03:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
we we added additional renovation space
 
03:26:16.630 --> 03:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
and we added
 
03:26:19.349 --> 03:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh like an occupational therapist area
 
03:26:21.510 --> 03:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
in a physical therapist area
 
03:26:24.070 --> 03:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
and as i was looking at the the clinical
 
03:26:25.750 --> 03:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
staff that was going in there i was
 
03:26:25.760 --> 03:26:26.229 align:start position:0%
staff that was going in there i was
thinking

03:26:26.229 --> 03:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
03:26:29.030 --> 03:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
you know we're really close to having a
 
03:26:29.040 --> 03:26:29.750 align:start position:0%
you know we're really close to having a
full-on

03:26:29.750 --> 03:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
full-on
 
03:26:32.229 --> 03:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
clinic in here can we can we really
 
03:26:32.239 --> 03:26:33.429 align:start position:0%
clinic in here can we can we really
start

03:26:33.429 --> 03:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
start
 
03:26:36.389 --> 03:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
building medicaid uh for this clinic
 
03:26:38.309 --> 03:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
operation we're running inside the
 
03:26:38.319 --> 03:26:39.349 align:start position:0%
operation we're running inside the
schools

03:26:39.349 --> 03:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
schools
 
03:26:42.469 --> 03:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
is that really what this is for
 
03:26:44.790 --> 03:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
medicaid eligible students where
 
03:26:46.630 --> 03:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
services are provided in the school
 
03:26:50.389 --> 03:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
yes that is what this is intended for um
 
03:26:53.429 --> 03:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
and i mentioned earlier the senate bill
 
03:26:53.439 --> 03:26:54.309 align:start position:0%
and i mentioned earlier the senate bill
684

03:26:54.309 --> 03:26:54.319 align:start position:0%
684
 
03:26:56.350 --> 03:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
from from last session um
 
03:26:56.360 --> 03:26:57.429 align:start position:0%
from from last session um
[Music]

03:26:57.429 --> 03:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:27:01.349 --> 03:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
that the you know telemedicine is
 
03:27:03.429 --> 03:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
available to the schools at basically
 
03:27:03.439 --> 03:27:03.910 align:start position:0%
available to the schools at basically
any

03:27:03.910 --> 03:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:27:06.150 --> 03:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
service that a qualified treatment
 
03:27:08.070 --> 03:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
provider meaning someone who is
 
03:27:10.389 --> 03:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
duly licensed by their appropriate
 
03:27:11.910 --> 03:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
professional board and it's a covered
 
03:27:13.510 --> 03:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
service under medicaid
 
03:27:16.630 --> 03:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
that schools can build the medicaid
 
03:27:19.670 --> 03:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
program for and but what
 
03:27:22.229 --> 03:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
schools have to pay is they they
 
03:27:23.830 --> 03:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
contribute 50 percent of
 
03:27:26.550 --> 03:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
the cost in other words they do what is
 
03:27:28.790 --> 03:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
called a certified public expenditure
 
03:27:32.070 --> 03:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
um and so when they build the state um
 
03:27:34.070 --> 03:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
half of it is covered they get half
 
03:27:35.590 --> 03:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
their money that what they would
 
03:27:37.670 --> 03:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise do because they're responsible
 
03:27:39.990 --> 03:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
under the just like we have to do in
 
03:27:42.150 --> 03:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
other parts of the medicaid program
 
03:27:45.190 --> 03:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
cover cover a minimum of 50 match
 
03:27:48.309 --> 03:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
except when there is this enhanced
 
03:27:50.710 --> 03:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
fmap situation the schools would only be
 
03:27:51.950 --> 03:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
03:27:54.630 --> 03:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
43.8 percent of the the cost and they
 
03:27:56.229 --> 03:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
could get reimbursement of the
 
03:27:59.269 --> 03:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
56.2 percent and what ended up happening
 
03:27:59.990 --> 03:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
is there was
 
03:28:03.190 --> 03:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
in between uh 20 and 21 as
 
03:28:05.830 --> 03:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
20 we had to recalibrate the program for
 
03:28:05.840 --> 03:28:06.469 align:start position:0%
20 we had to recalibrate the program for
um

03:28:06.469 --> 03:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:09.590 --> 03:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know new guidance or clarification
 
03:28:10.710 --> 03:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
of guidance
 
03:28:13.590 --> 03:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
and the work with the legislature on
 
03:28:14.790 --> 03:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
some things in the office of
 
03:28:16.150 --> 03:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
professional licensure
 
03:28:19.590 --> 03:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
on others so that in the long run
 
03:28:21.110 --> 03:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
schools will be able to do this
 
03:28:22.790 --> 03:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
we are working very close with the
 
03:28:24.950 --> 03:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
department of education on this
 
03:28:28.309 --> 03:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
we participate in a couple different
 
03:28:32.870 --> 03:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:35.030 --> 03:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's a the new hampshire charitable
 
03:28:36.150 --> 03:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
foundation has
 
03:28:38.790 --> 03:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
put together a work group of both
 
03:28:40.309 --> 03:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
03:28:42.630 --> 03:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
medicaid as well as other stakeholders
 
03:28:43.830 --> 03:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
like school districts
 
03:28:46.070 --> 03:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
to to work together and most recently
 
03:28:47.910 --> 03:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
approved a grant
 
03:28:52.070 --> 03:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
to help develop a cooperative to support
 
03:28:53.750 --> 03:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
schools so that they can take further
 
03:28:55.670 --> 03:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
advantage of the
 
03:28:58.389 --> 03:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
medicaid schools program what's our
 
03:28:59.590 --> 03:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
penetration rate
 
03:29:01.670 --> 03:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
what what percentage of schools in new
 
03:29:02.710 --> 03:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire do you think
 
03:29:05.590 --> 03:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
are leveraging this program to some
 
03:29:05.600 --> 03:29:05.990 align:start position:0%
are leveraging this program to some
degree

03:29:05.990 --> 03:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
degree
 
03:29:07.670 --> 03:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
there i think there are 172 school
 
03:29:09.590 --> 03:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
districts i think there are only
 
03:29:10.950 --> 03:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
approximately nine that don't
 
03:29:14.229 --> 03:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
participate in it at all
 
03:29:17.030 --> 03:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
this was my argument at hb in the
 
03:29:17.040 --> 03:29:17.670 align:start position:0%
this was my argument at hb in the
division

03:29:17.670 --> 03:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
division
 
03:29:20.870 --> 03:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
two was that we were never able to find
 
03:29:21.750 --> 03:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
out when it's
 
03:29:24.790 --> 03:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
when a district says we spent three and
 
03:29:26.229 --> 03:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
a half times
 
03:29:29.510 --> 03:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
the average cost per student
 
03:29:34.950 --> 03:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:37.750 --> 03:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
special education funds and you didn't
 
03:29:39.429 --> 03:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
know whether that three and a half times
 
03:29:41.349 --> 03:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
was coming from medicaid for schools or
 
03:29:42.550 --> 03:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
where it was coming from and they
 
03:29:44.710 --> 03:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't tell you
 
03:29:48.630 --> 03:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
they always hid behind hipaa
 
03:29:50.070 --> 03:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
so i think we ought to have something in
 
03:29:50.080 --> 03:29:54.309 align:start position:0%
so i think we ought to have something in
hb2

03:29:54.309 --> 03:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:56.469 --> 03:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
to say that you can't count that money
 
03:30:00.870 --> 03:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:04.229 --> 03:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
okay did you get
 
03:30:06.550 --> 03:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
did you get a note on that mr ripple do
 
03:30:08.550 --> 03:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
you have any follow-up questions of
 
03:30:10.710 --> 03:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
representative weiler to make sure you
 
03:30:11.830 --> 03:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
understand what he's
 
03:30:15.110 --> 03:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh asking for yeah that one i didn't
 
03:30:18.389 --> 03:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
quite catch representatives
 
03:30:20.870 --> 03:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
when we were in uh division two and
 
03:30:22.790 --> 03:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
03:30:25.670 --> 03:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
when a district decides to go to the
 
03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
catastrophic aid
 
03:30:29.830 --> 03:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
to spend three and a half times the
 
03:30:32.309 --> 03:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
normal cost of a student
 
03:30:34.150 --> 03:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
and then they can ask for catastrophic
 
03:30:36.389 --> 03:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
aid and they get 80
 
03:30:38.309 --> 03:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
of their costs up until they spend 10
 
03:30:40.630 --> 03:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
times the average cost at which time
 
03:30:44.870 --> 03:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
catastrophic care takes over 100
 
03:30:47.990 --> 03:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
so if they were getting money from other
 
03:30:48.000 --> 03:30:49.510 align:start position:0%
so if they were getting money from other
sources

03:30:49.510 --> 03:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
sources
 
03:30:51.670 --> 03:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
like medicaid to schools they would
 
03:30:53.269 --> 03:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
still count that
 
03:30:55.510 --> 03:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
in the three and a half times and if you
 
03:30:56.309 --> 03:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
if you said
 
03:30:57.910 --> 03:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
are you counting any other monies other
 
03:31:00.309 --> 03:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
than your own district funds
 
03:31:01.830 --> 03:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
they didn't have to tell you when they
 
03:31:01.840 --> 03:31:03.429 align:start position:0%
they didn't have to tell you when they
wouldn't

03:31:03.429 --> 03:31:03.439 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
03:31:07.030 --> 03:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:11.030 --> 03:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
okay kevin if i could
 
03:31:12.710 --> 03:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
what the schools can collect under
 
03:31:14.070 --> 03:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
medicaid to schools is
 
03:31:16.790 --> 03:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
50 of uh generally 50 percent of the
 
03:31:18.309 --> 03:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
medicaid fee schedule
 
03:31:21.910 --> 03:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
and during the the
 
03:31:24.309 --> 03:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
enhanced fmap it's 56.2 percent of the
 
03:31:30.870 --> 03:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:32.630 --> 03:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any other hands
 
03:31:34.150 --> 03:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative weiler did you have a
 
03:31:34.160 --> 03:31:36.229 align:start position:0%
representative weiler did you have a
follow-up

03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:31:39.349 --> 03:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
no thanks okay all right
 
03:31:41.750 --> 03:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
so so now i think we're done is that
 
03:31:43.429 --> 03:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
right that is correct
 
03:31:46.389 --> 03:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
we are done with the accounting units
 
03:31:49.750 --> 03:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:52.389 --> 03:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
that's getting us very close to being in
 
03:31:52.399 --> 03:31:53.269 align:start position:0%
that's getting us very close to being in
overall

03:31:53.269 --> 03:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
overall
 
03:31:55.110 --> 03:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative earth do you have a
 
03:31:57.110 --> 03:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
question i wasn't able to
 
03:31:59.990 --> 03:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
ask karen about three accounting units
 
03:32:01.030 --> 03:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
just to know if they
 
03:32:05.429 --> 03:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
were existing in fy 21.
 
03:32:09.110 --> 03:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
okay i will do my best go ahead um
 
03:32:13.349 --> 03:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:15.910 --> 03:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
what area was that in bureau family
 
03:32:15.920 --> 03:32:20.229 align:start position:0%
what area was that in bureau family
assistance

03:32:20.229 --> 03:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:21.670 --> 03:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
and then we don't have any expenditures
 
03:32:24.710 --> 03:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
in there for 22 and 23.
 
03:32:26.229 --> 03:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
no no no and uh you don't have it in
 
03:32:28.790 --> 03:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
there for um 21. sorry
 
03:32:31.269 --> 03:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
i think the new accounting unit i think
 
03:32:34.150 --> 03:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
that got moved from dcyf
 
03:32:39.670 --> 03:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
okay and then 7215 ssbg
 
03:32:41.030 --> 03:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
also in that same bureau family
 
03:32:43.190 --> 03:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
assistance i think that's the same thing
 
03:32:45.269 --> 03:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
but i'd have to double check
 
03:32:48.630 --> 03:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
and then 7216 a kinship grant
 
03:32:51.670 --> 03:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
that one did come from dcyf okay we say
 
03:32:52.950 --> 03:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
came from as new
 
03:32:56.070 --> 03:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
as new entities as in it was previously
 
03:32:59.030 --> 03:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
budgeted in dcyf and we moved it to dehs
 
03:33:00.950 --> 03:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
i think joe ripsom talked about it in
 
03:33:02.870 --> 03:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
his budget presentation
 
03:33:05.269 --> 03:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'm saying is what would i
 
03:33:06.710 --> 03:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
would it just be a subpart of one of
 
03:33:07.750 --> 03:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
those or would it be a separate
 
03:33:09.190 --> 03:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
standalone thing would i be able to find
 
03:33:12.309 --> 03:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
sspg and dcyf
 
03:33:14.070 --> 03:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
i don't remember if they were standalone
 
03:33:16.150 --> 03:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
accounting units in dcyf or not
 
03:33:18.950 --> 03:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
i i'd have to get that for you okay
 
03:33:19.990 --> 03:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:33:22.070 --> 03:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
you're more likely just absorbed in a
 
03:33:23.190 --> 03:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
different program
 
03:33:26.150 --> 03:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
i would guess probably that i i'm not
 
03:33:29.110 --> 03:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:33.429 --> 03:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
okay uh so um
 
03:33:36.389 --> 03:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
mr lippman you you've talked a lot do
 
03:33:37.670 --> 03:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
you have any sort of uh
 
03:33:39.830 --> 03:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
summary thoughts for us after we've gone
 
03:33:41.590 --> 03:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
through all of this and
 
03:33:43.750 --> 03:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
because we've we're freshly broken
 
03:33:45.510 --> 03:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
through all the brush do you have a big
 
03:33:46.870 --> 03:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
picture of you first
 
03:33:50.710 --> 03:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
as we summarize i guess the big picture
 
03:33:52.710 --> 03:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
03:33:55.030 --> 03:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
what is going to be available from a
 
03:33:56.150 --> 03:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
federal matching
 
03:33:57.830 --> 03:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
perspective based on the length of the
 
03:33:59.429 --> 03:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
public health emergency
 
03:34:01.429 --> 03:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
is something that we will have to
 
03:34:03.510 --> 03:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
continue to evolve as we move through
 
03:34:07.030 --> 03:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
the phases here um and i think that some
 
03:34:08.550 --> 03:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
of the priority needs
 
03:34:11.510 --> 03:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
that were identified could be affected
 
03:34:12.070 --> 03:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
by that
 
03:34:14.389 --> 03:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
as well for example the we talked about
 
03:34:16.150 --> 03:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
the state phase down
 
03:34:17.990 --> 03:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
um in terms of from an operational
 
03:34:19.990 --> 03:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint filling in
 
03:34:21.990 --> 03:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
some of these vacant positions are
 
03:34:23.510 --> 03:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
really important if
 
03:34:26.790 --> 03:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
we can't move um forward on i.t
 
03:34:29.990 --> 03:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
projects without staff um and uh
 
03:34:31.990 --> 03:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
that it's important to do so so that we
 
03:34:33.830 --> 03:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
don't lose federal match
 
03:34:36.950 --> 03:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
um in that area um and
 
03:34:39.990 --> 03:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of the things like
 
03:34:43.110 --> 03:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
dental i think that um you'll your you
 
03:34:44.710 --> 03:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
and your colleagues will i think be
 
03:34:45.910 --> 03:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
judging the
 
03:34:47.830 --> 03:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
um what's in the two bills that are
 
03:34:49.269 --> 03:34:49.279 align:start position:0%
moving through the senate in the house
 
03:34:50.550 --> 03:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
they think that
 
03:34:53.349 --> 03:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
you can't disconnect the mouth from the
 
03:34:55.830 --> 03:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
rest of the body that there are
 
03:34:57.910 --> 03:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
long-term um while there's some
 
03:35:00.150 --> 03:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
short-term costs or long-term
 
03:35:01.910 --> 03:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
benefits i think of as you've pointed
 
03:35:04.150 --> 03:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
out representative edwards in terms of
 
03:35:08.229 --> 03:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
not ignoring those types of situations
 
03:35:11.670 --> 03:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
i think that you know we run
 
03:35:15.590 --> 03:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
a pretty lean and efficient program
 
03:35:17.990 --> 03:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
overall there are opportunities to
 
03:35:19.030 --> 03:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
improve and
 
03:35:20.870 --> 03:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
i think we disclose some of those in our
 
03:35:22.309 --> 03:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
quality presentation that we're going to
 
03:35:23.670 --> 03:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
continue to work on
 
03:35:26.309 --> 03:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
and we appreciate the support that you
 
03:35:26.319 --> 03:35:26.790 align:start position:0%
and we appreciate the support that you
can

03:35:26.790 --> 03:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:35:28.550 --> 03:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
provide to the beneficiaries that we
 
03:35:28.560 --> 03:35:29.830 align:start position:0%
provide to the beneficiaries that we
serve

03:35:29.830 --> 03:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
serve
 
03:35:32.550 --> 03:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
in this uh this budget um i don't know
 
03:35:32.560 --> 03:35:33.269 align:start position:0%
in this uh this budget um i don't know
if

03:35:33.269 --> 03:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:35:34.870 --> 03:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
athena or karen you would add anything
 
03:35:35.250 --> 03:35:35.260 align:start position:0%
to that
 
03:35:35.260 --> 03:35:36.710 align:start position:0%
to that
[Music]

03:35:36.710 --> 03:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:35:38.389 --> 03:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
i think so other than just saying thank
 
03:35:42.229 --> 03:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:46.790 --> 03:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:49.910 --> 03:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
45 attendees and we're going to give it
 
03:35:51.110 --> 03:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
a few seconds
 
03:35:53.110 --> 03:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
for somebody to see if they want to
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
raise their hand and make a comment for
 
03:35:55.439 --> 03:35:55.750 align:start position:0%
raise their hand and make a comment for
the

03:35:55.750 --> 03:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:35:58.550 --> 03:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
the good of the committee so we learn
 
03:35:59.990 --> 03:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
something more about the budget
 
03:36:04.070 --> 03:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%

03:36:41.349 --> 03:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:44.389 --> 03:36:44.399 align:start position:0%

we've everyone's got town meeting day
 
03:36:51.510 --> 03:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow so i i don't think we have
 
03:36:53.190 --> 03:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
anything in the house calendar
 
03:36:54.870 --> 03:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
mr ripple what what are you going to say
 
03:36:56.469 --> 03:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
can we meet tomorrow afternoon
 
03:36:58.229 --> 03:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
you do actually that was last week it
 
03:36:59.990 --> 03:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
was decided that you would meet tomorrow
 
03:37:01.910 --> 03:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
starting at noon so you do have some
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
time set aside tomorrow and it's not for
 
03:37:03.840 --> 03:37:04.389 align:start position:0%
time set aside tomorrow and it's not for
anything

03:37:04.389 --> 03:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:37:06.389 --> 03:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
specific at this point so if you wanted
 
03:37:08.229 --> 03:37:08.239 align:start position:0%
to continue with this presentation
 
03:37:11.269 --> 03:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
tomorrow instead you could do that
 
03:37:14.710 --> 03:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
i would say that this presentation
 
03:37:15.990 --> 03:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
or just gonna say i would say that this
 
03:37:18.630 --> 03:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
presentation probably will take at least
 
03:37:20.950 --> 03:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
three to four hours so i don't know if
 
03:37:22.550 --> 03:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
you want to start it today
 
03:37:25.990 --> 03:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:27.750 --> 03:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
are you are you available to support it
 
03:37:29.429 --> 03:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
tomorrow afternoon
 
03:37:31.830 --> 03:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
i am with you however many days and
 
03:37:33.190 --> 03:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
hours you need me
 
03:37:35.429 --> 03:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
i mean the the department head i don't
 
03:37:36.469 --> 03:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
know who's yes
 
03:37:38.790 --> 03:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
yes i did speak with deb sheets as well
 
03:37:39.750 --> 03:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
and she is
 
03:37:41.349 --> 03:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
available whenever you need her to be
 
03:37:42.710 --> 03:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
available so she can be available
 
03:37:44.790 --> 03:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
tomorrow as well
 
03:37:46.710 --> 03:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
so i guess i didn't look at the calendar
 
03:37:49.269 --> 03:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
very well what time do we start noon
 
03:37:53.510 --> 03:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:57.030 --> 03:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
so um is this technically an adjournment
 
03:37:58.550 --> 03:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
for the day or a resource
 
03:38:01.830 --> 03:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
recess till tomorrow you could adjourn
 
03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
for the day
 
03:38:08.469 --> 03:38:08.479 align:start position:0%
so um i'm not seeing anyone suggesting
 
03:38:10.389 --> 03:38:10.399 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't adjourn
 
03:38:12.150 --> 03:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead and adjourn this meeting
 
03:38:17.349 --> 03:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
