1469

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 align:start position:0%
1469
 
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
1695 student identifiable information
 
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
and that's it for there's 11 bills there
 
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 align:start position:0%
totaling a total of 18 bills which we
 
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
could possibly look at we looked at 19
 
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.629 align:start position:0%
could possibly look at we looked at 19
yesterday

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
1476 in 1476 yes corre it's I didn't
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
read it Charter that's theou of the
 
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.550 align:start position:0%
read it Charter that's theou of the
charter

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 align:start position:0%
charter
 
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
schools so that makes a total of 18
 
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
bills so what we want to do is for the
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
public knowing that we're not going to
 
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
be doing some of the other bills which
 
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
weren't mentioned so you don't wait have
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
to wait here and thinking you're going
 
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
to have that um so there's no higher
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
education bills being discussed
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
today um so what we'll do is we'll break
 
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
into caucus and
 
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
um each caucus look at these bills and
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
then we'll come back and we'll try to
 
00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
find where there's any common ground
 
00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
or me yeah we'll do that afterwards yeah
 
00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I think that's probably more
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
appropriate that you have a chance so
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
right now we are going to go in a
 
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
caucus um it this would I expect this
 
00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 align:start position:0%
will take a little bit of time seeing
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
that we haven't had really you know some
 
00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
groups probably haven't looked at some
 
00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
of these bills um so um I would say it's
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
going to be at least a 20 minute caucus
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
probably right to about
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
10:30 maybe even longer who
 
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 align:start position:0%

okay

01:15:35.229 --> 01:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay I think I think we're ready to go
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
here uh
 
01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
just for everybody um there's going to
 
01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
be a number of bills today which we're
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
going to end up with no recommendation
 
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
that's the route we're going to go so
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
what we've agreed upon uh between
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative Miler and myself is that
 
01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
when we're at one of those bills where
 
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know the the person that's you know
 
01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
made the motion will be able to speak
 
01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
but beyond that we that's it we want to
 
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
get these things done so because we know
 
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to come out with a
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
1010 we know that so because we have
 
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
these early bills we need to get them so
 
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
we can get down into the bottom part of
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
this list as well so the first bill
 
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
which we want to to um
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
address is the
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
1655 it's an early Bill educator
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:45.910 align:start position:0%
 
1655

01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's okay I recognize uh representa
 
01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
cordelli for a
 
01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
motion uh thank you Mr chairman I'd like
 
01:16:55.709 --> 01:16:55.719 align:start position:0%
to move out to pass on House Bill
 
01:16:58.750 --> 01:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
1655 is there a second on
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
1655 I'll second it so we have a motion
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
made by representative cordelli and
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
second by representative luno the motion
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass representa cordelli or
 
01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
represent either one of you want to
 
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
speak on this I'll pass just real quick
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
CH I I I I think this is a housekeeping
 
01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
um sort of Bill I don't think it's
 
01:17:20.350 --> 01:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
caused a problem in the past but I don't
 
01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
think the change will cause a cause a
 
01:17:25.229 --> 01:17:25.239 align:start position:0%
problem either so I think it's probably
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
also another bill that shouldn't have
 
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%

01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
duty of the committee of Finance to
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
examine and consider appropriations of
 
01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
State money as we know School meals play
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
a critical role in the health well-being
 
01:24:11.149 --> 01:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
and academic success of students we
 
01:24:12.669 --> 01:24:12.679 align:start position:0%
received testimony from New Hampshire
 
01:24:15.390 --> 01:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
hunger solutions that over half of New
 
01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children reportedly live in
 
01:24:19.470 --> 01:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
households with insufficient
 
01:24:22.110 --> 01:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
food this bill is an effort to alleviate
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
food food insecurity and poverty and to
 
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
support good nutrition School meals are
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
as essential as buses books computers
 
01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
last year we heard from a former
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
superintendent that the most difficult
 
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
part of his job was calling off school
 
01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
knowing that students might not eat that
 
01:24:41.229 --> 01:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
day that was heartbreaking our
 
01:24:44.189 --> 01:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
neighboring states of Vermont Maine and
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts all have passed permanent
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
Universal meals
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
legislation House Bill 1212 is an
 
01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:53.639 align:start position:0%
investment in New Hampshire future it's
 
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
not only the right thing to do it's the
 
01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
least we can do I hope you will join me
 
01:24:59.550 --> 01:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
in voting
 
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
OTP thank you okay um represent B thank
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I guess I'll give a a brief
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
talk on this one um so hb212 so what the
 
01:25:13.629 --> 01:25:13.639 align:start position:0%
bill does is it proposes to ra raise the
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
eligibility threshold for free School
 
01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:19.639 align:start position:0%
meals from the current 185% of poverty
 
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
level to 350 uh% of poverty level um and
 
01:25:27.149 --> 01:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
it would allocate New Hampshire taxpayer
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
funds to cover that difference as no
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
federal reimbursement would be available
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
for um the program proposed here uh the
 
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
community did receive competing fiscal
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
analyses of this bill though what is
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
entirely clear out of these analyses is
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
that the minimum cost that we've seen
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
would be approximately $50 million per
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
year more realistic appeared to be the
 
01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
100 million figure but depending on
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
whether schools are doing breakfast and
 
01:25:53.950 --> 01:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
lunch it is conceivable that the actual
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
final amount could double
 
01:25:58.750 --> 01:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
that critically important to this
 
01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
proposal is that despite we are looking
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
to expend New Hampshire taxpayer funds
 
01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:07.639 align:start position:0%
solely on this program we the New
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers and us as their
 
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
representatives would have virtually no
 
01:26:13.629 --> 01:26:13.639 align:start position:0%
Senator pel you can't come in here right
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
now we would have virtually no control
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
over the expenditure of these funds
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
because we are essentially using them to
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
expand an existing Federal progam
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
program so all of the current federal
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines would continue to apply
 
01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
including as we've heard uh guidelines
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
that have bidding requirements that
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
don't allow us to purchase local
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
nutritious Foods because they don't come
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
in low enough in the bidding it would
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
require USDA nutritional guidelines
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
which at this point are very highly
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
contested for their extreme um emphasis
 
01:26:49.629 --> 01:26:49.639 align:start position:0%
on carbohydrate load uh and to which the
 
01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
program has demonstrated approximately
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
30 % waste because of per studies what
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
the studies say is that there's an
 
01:26:59.070 --> 01:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
inherent lack of emphasis on
 
01:27:01.709 --> 01:27:01.719 align:start position:0%
palatability and desirability of the
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
food under USDA guidelines uh finally
 
01:27:07.470 --> 01:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
just to just to clarify a point between
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
between food and security and um food
 
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
insufficiency we did receive testimony
 
01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
that a large very large percentage of
 
01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students are food
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
insecure I delved into the dumbers a
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
little bit and specifically the question
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
asked in order to determine whether
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
their food insufficient
 
01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
is do you have enough of the specific
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
food that you want to
 
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
eat in order to eat that now given the
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
way that question is worded I'm food
 
01:27:42.149 --> 01:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
insufficient because I'd like to have a
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
ribeye every single night toss are up I
 
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
might get one a month if I'm lucky but
 
01:27:49.629 --> 01:27:49.639 align:start position:0%
actually looking at Food
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
insufficiency which would be the other
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
category we were not provided numbers
 
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
for that but they would undoubtedly be
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
significantly lower and I would like to
 
01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
see some actual numbers regarding food
 
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh insufficiency not merely insecurity
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
if we are to expend these kinds of funds
 
01:28:11.709 --> 01:28:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
vote okay um not seeing any further

381

02:49:16.590 --> 02:49:16.600 align:start position:0%
381
 
02:49:18.670 --> 02:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
H uh this
 
02:49:21.110 --> 02:49:21.120 align:start position:0%

yep do we have a second representative
 
02:49:28.150 --> 02:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
lakas uh does everyone have the uh
 
02:49:29.950 --> 02:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment it went around during launch I
 
02:49:35.550 --> 02:49:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:40.590 --> 02:49:40.600 align:start position:0%
381 okay please proceed thank you um so
 
02:49:44.110 --> 02:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
this makes a number of changes that were
 
02:49:45.830 --> 02:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
I believe NE necessary to this bill to
 
02:49:48.269 --> 02:49:48.279 align:start position:0%
make it function and proper uh without
 
02:49:50.429 --> 02:49:50.439 align:start position:0%
changing the underlying intent of the
 
02:49:52.630 --> 02:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
bill and what it actually is seeking to
 
02:49:56.070 --> 02:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
accomplish um so we retain the concept
 
02:49:58.670 --> 02:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
of a farm to school program that is
 
02:50:01.710 --> 02:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
going to be funded uh as a pilot program
 
02:50:02.790 --> 02:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
02:50:06.030 --> 02:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
coffers and let's go through the changes
 
02:50:08.389 --> 02:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
I've made from the original bill first
 
02:50:11.590 --> 02:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
um under item two I have modified the
 
02:50:15.150 --> 02:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
committee to be in ACC EXC me item two
 
02:50:17.670 --> 02:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
you referring to Roman 2 yes okay
 
02:50:20.190 --> 02:50:20.200 align:start position:0%
apologies uh I have modified the
 
02:50:23.030 --> 02:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
committee to be the makeup that was
 
02:50:26.110 --> 02:50:26.120 align:start position:0%
recommended uh in testimony from from uh
 
02:50:27.830 --> 02:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
some of the experts we heard
 
02:50:40.950 --> 02:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:43.950 --> 02:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
Roman yeah so that that was lines 12 and

in

02:50:47.030 --> 02:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:50:49.510 --> 02:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
the bill or in the
 
02:50:54.070 --> 02:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:06.389 --> 02:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:09.670 --> 02:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
yes is included a farmer or farmer
 
02:51:11.309 --> 02:51:11.319 align:start position:0%

notic
 
02:51:19.389 --> 02:51:19.399 align:start position:0%
that okay go ahead representative thank
 
02:51:22.590 --> 02:51:22.600 align:start position:0%
you uh in Roman 3 I have struck part of
 
02:51:25.190 --> 02:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
the last sentence um which would have
 
02:51:27.070 --> 02:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
allowed for the purchase of of kitchen
 
02:51:29.710 --> 02:51:29.720 align:start position:0%
equipment or storage equipment um I
 
02:51:31.950 --> 02:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
believe this should be really designed
 
02:51:35.590 --> 02:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
to help the farmers and purchase food
 
02:51:37.630 --> 02:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
not not equipment which could eat up a
 
02:51:40.070 --> 02:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
lot of the funds very
 
02:51:45.950 --> 02:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
quickly the Roman four I have struck New
 
02:51:48.710 --> 02:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
England um to limit the program to New
 
02:51:52.590 --> 02:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh simply because I cannot
 
02:51:55.110 --> 02:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
justify uh using New Hampshire taxpayer
 
02:51:58.469 --> 02:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
funds to subsidize out ofate
 
02:52:03.269 --> 02:52:03.279 align:start position:0%
farms in Roman 6 this is uh actually
 
02:52:04.870 --> 02:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
let's go back to five Roman five the
 
02:52:07.990 --> 02:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
last sentence excluding uh fluid
 
02:52:11.910 --> 02:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:16.190 --> 02:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
struck Roman six all all of Roman six
 
02:52:18.469 --> 02:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
was struck and this was uh of critical
 
02:52:20.190 --> 02:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
importance because as the bill was
 
02:52:23.070 --> 02:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
originally written we've heard testimony
 
02:52:25.870 --> 02:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
from multiple people that the bill um
 
02:52:27.590 --> 02:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
the current reason that they can't
 
02:52:30.550 --> 02:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
purchase uh New Hampshire products in a
 
02:52:33.030 --> 02:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
significant quantity is because the USDA
 
02:52:36.229 --> 02:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
free lunch program bidding requirements
 
02:52:39.510 --> 02:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
are uh prohibitive because New Hampshire
 
02:52:41.070 --> 02:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
Farmers simply can't get their costs
 
02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
down enough to be able to sell it uh at
 
02:52:43.439 --> 02:52:45.150 align:start position:0%
down enough to be able to sell it uh at
profit

02:52:45.150 --> 02:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
profit
 
02:52:47.670 --> 02:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
um so in order to actually make this
 
02:52:49.670 --> 02:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
program work we have to eliminate the
 
02:52:52.150 --> 02:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
references to USDA program and put this
 
02:52:54.389 --> 02:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
program into the state hands instead of
 
02:52:58.429 --> 02:52:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:01.389 --> 02:53:01.399 align:start position:0%
program in Roman
 
02:53:04.229 --> 02:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
7 um changes were made to reflect that
 
02:53:06.550 --> 02:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
this is a New Hampshire program not um
 
02:53:08.790 --> 02:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
New England
 
02:53:12.389 --> 02:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
wide I've also modified uh the language
 
02:53:14.030 --> 02:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
regarding what happens with retained
 
02:53:15.830 --> 02:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
funds or excess funds because it was
 
02:53:19.349 --> 02:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
unclear in the original bill now
 
02:53:22.710 --> 02:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
um the uh unspent funds will be
 
02:53:25.190 --> 02:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
reallocated um between schools within
 
02:53:27.790 --> 02:53:27.800 align:start position:0%
the private program after the first year
 
02:53:29.590 --> 02:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
to be expended in the manner prescribed
 
02:53:32.910 --> 02:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
herein during year two of the pilot
 
02:53:35.990 --> 02:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
program uh and the last sentence in
 
02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:37.750 align:start position:0%
program uh and the last sentence in
Roman

02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
Roman
 
02:53:40.309 --> 02:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
7 uh there there was an addition to the
 
02:53:43.670 --> 02:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
end uh to say that at the end of the
 
02:53:45.190 --> 02:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
pilot program I'm assuming that this is
 
02:53:49.269 --> 02:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
not re repped um any unused funds would
 
02:53:52.950 --> 02:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:55.830 --> 02:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
fund Roman
 
02:53:59.070 --> 02:53:59.080 align:start position:0%
nine uh modifications have been made to
 
02:54:02.070 --> 02:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
add a couple criteria to help us track
 
02:54:03.910 --> 02:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh the performance of this program and
 
02:54:07.309 --> 02:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
some metrics and to also allow the U
 
02:54:10.229 --> 02:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
committee that is formed or commission
 
02:54:13.070 --> 02:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
committee whatever it's labeled as um to
 
02:54:23.309 --> 02:54:23.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:23.319 --> 02:54:29.790 align:start position:0%
 
purposes

02:54:29.790 --> 02:54:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
struck yeah excuse me I think in the
 
02:54:35.309 --> 02:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
original Bill Roman 6 in the original
 
02:54:40.190 --> 02:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
bill was removed right yes so this is a
 
02:54:45.070 --> 02:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
new 7 8 and N excuse me 67 and eight in
 
02:54:47.590 --> 02:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment correct so it's been
 
02:54:49.670 --> 02:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
relabeled to I apologize I was referring
 
02:54:51.229 --> 02:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
to the original bill now it's become
 
02:54:55.990 --> 02:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
nine

02:54:58.070 --> 02:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
nine
 
02:55:00.750 --> 02:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
and that appears to be it for for
 
02:55:02.630 --> 02:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
changes to this bill I'd be happy to
 
02:55:09.670 --> 02:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:13.190 --> 02:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:21.269 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:55:21.269 --> 02:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:25.389 --> 02:55:25.399 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I don't see in the
 
02:55:27.510 --> 02:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
amendment if I'm correct that this is
 
02:55:29.229 --> 02:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
essentially replacing language there's
 
02:55:33.030 --> 02:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:35.469 --> 02:55:35.479 align:start position:0%
amendment represent what in the original
 
02:55:40.190 --> 02:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
bill is page two lines 22 to 27 that's
 
02:55:41.710 --> 02:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
the exact same problem we had with the
 
02:55:43.750 --> 02:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
other bill that we're trying to amend so
 
02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:45.070 align:start position:0%
other bill that we're trying to amend so
that

02:55:45.070 --> 02:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:55:50.429 --> 02:55:50.439 align:start position:0%
now no sorry right so um if you look on
 
02:55:54.070 --> 02:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
the original Bill line 22 that stays
 
02:55:56.309 --> 02:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
because the um Amendment just says
 
02:55:59.710 --> 02:55:59.720 align:start position:0%
inserted by section one so section two
 
02:56:03.190 --> 02:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't change on from the original Bill
 
02:56:05.550 --> 02:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
correct thank you for the clarification
 
02:56:07.710 --> 02:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
may I continue with other questions
 
02:56:09.269 --> 02:56:09.279 align:start position:0%
followup thank
 
02:56:09.279 --> 02:56:11.830 align:start position:0%
followup thank
you

02:56:11.830 --> 02:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:56:16.830 --> 02:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:20.070 --> 02:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
I would appreciate some clearer language
 
02:56:22.269 --> 02:56:22.279 align:start position:0%
on what an expert in childhood nutrition
 
02:56:24.309 --> 02:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
is and would suggest that it's say a
 
02:56:28.469 --> 02:56:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:30.630 --> 02:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
expertise I guess that's not a qu would
 
02:56:32.870 --> 02:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
you entertain that now it's a question I
 
02:56:34.469 --> 02:56:34.479 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it but I think at this late
 
02:56:35.750 --> 02:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
stage it's going to be too late to try
 
02:56:37.670 --> 02:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
to get another amendment on this bill so
 
02:56:40.480 --> 02:56:40.490 align:start position:0%
I I would prefer to leave it as
 
02:56:40.490 --> 02:56:43.070 align:start position:0%
I I would prefer to leave it as
[Music]

02:56:43.070 --> 02:56:43.080 align:start position:0%

representative belger for bringing this
 
02:56:51.550 --> 02:56:51.560 align:start position:0%
forward I think you made some excellent
 
02:56:53.510 --> 02:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
changes I just have a question to
 
02:56:56.550 --> 02:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
clarify line six of your Amendment says
 
02:56:58.510 --> 02:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
that the money could be purchas used to
 
02:57:00.309 --> 02:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
purchase from New Hampshire and New
 
02:57:02.710 --> 02:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
England P um producers but then if you
 
02:57:04.990 --> 02:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
go on to line 26 and other places in the
 
02:57:07.110 --> 02:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
bill it says Foods purchased under the
 
02:57:09.110 --> 02:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
program shall originate in New Hampshire
 
02:57:11.030 --> 02:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
so my question is is it New Hampshire or
 
02:57:12.750 --> 02:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
is it New Hampshire and the rest of New
 
02:57:15.229 --> 02:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
England thank you and and yes that is a
 
02:57:17.630 --> 02:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
very good question um line six that was
 
02:57:19.550 --> 02:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
an oversight on my part that was an
 
02:57:21.150 --> 02:57:21.160 align:start position:0%
error to not remove New England
 
02:57:23.550 --> 02:57:23.560 align:start position:0%
producers however in terms of the effect
 
02:57:25.990 --> 02:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
of the law what we're seeing in line one
 
02:57:27.870 --> 02:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
is simply a description it does not
 
02:57:29.950 --> 02:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
actually affect the execution of the law
 
02:57:31.630 --> 02:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
which is clear to New Hampshire I would
 
02:57:33.429 --> 02:57:33.439 align:start position:0%
hope that the Senate would be able to
 
02:57:37.030 --> 02:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:41.030 --> 02:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
England represent Miler thank you Mr
 
02:57:43.990 --> 02:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
chair when we had this bill before one
 
02:57:45.990 --> 02:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that was raised by
 
02:57:49.309 --> 02:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
chairman lad was the issue I think he
 
02:57:53.110 --> 02:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
was talking about a large Dairy Farm in
 
02:57:56.070 --> 02:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
Vermont that did a lot of business in
 
02:57:56.080 --> 02:57:56.950 align:start position:0%
Vermont that did a lot of business in
New

02:57:56.950 --> 02:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
New
 
02:58:00.190 --> 02:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but based upon this
 
02:58:03.269 --> 02:58:03.279 align:start position:0%
language would that would exclude that
 
02:58:05.750 --> 02:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
purchase of whatever it might be whether
 
02:58:08.950 --> 02:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
it be beef or whatever from a Vermont
 
02:58:11.269 --> 02:58:11.279 align:start position:0%
producer is that correct correct it
 
02:58:13.070 --> 02:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
would have to be an origin New Hampshire
 
02:58:21.190 --> 02:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:24.710 --> 02:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
you represent Damon thank you Mr chair
 
02:58:29.190 --> 02:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
yes I have more um relative to
 
02:58:33.469 --> 02:58:33.479 align:start position:0%
the um effort to remove New England
 
02:58:37.190 --> 02:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
producers New Hampshire has a lot of
 
02:58:39.110 --> 02:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
farms on the
 
02:58:42.110 --> 02:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
borders of our intersecting
 
02:58:44.389 --> 02:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
States as a represent resentative for
 
02:58:48.309 --> 02:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County Claremont the only
 
02:58:49.590 --> 02:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
distinction between Claremont and
 
02:58:51.670 --> 02:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
Vermont geographically speaking is the
 
02:58:54.750 --> 02:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
cantica river I know of at least one
 
02:58:57.389 --> 02:58:57.399 align:start position:0%
school district in my representative
 
02:58:59.349 --> 02:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
district that their food service is run
 
02:59:01.910 --> 02:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
by a Vermont owned company and they buy
 
02:59:04.150 --> 02:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
from Vermont and New Hampshire
 
02:59:06.910 --> 02:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
Farms I don't think the removing New
 
02:59:10.309 --> 02:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
England prohibition makes sense it it's
 
02:59:10.319 --> 02:59:12.830 align:start position:0%
England prohibition makes sense it it's
functionally

02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
functionally
 
02:59:12.840 --> 02:59:14.790 align:start position:0%
functionally
difficult

02:59:14.790 --> 02:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:59:16.910 --> 02:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
let me kick in on that a little bit here
 
02:59:18.150 --> 02:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the Connecticut
 
02:59:20.150 --> 02:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
River of course we own the Connecticut
 
02:59:22.550 --> 02:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
River their land starts on the other
 
02:59:24.150 --> 02:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
side of it
 
02:59:27.790 --> 02:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
um so but uh we do have some Interstate
 
02:59:30.229 --> 02:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
school districts as well and I've talked
 
02:59:32.550 --> 02:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
about Fairley Vermont uh and Orford
 
02:59:33.990 --> 02:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
being linked together Fairley and
 
02:59:37.150 --> 02:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
Corinth and some of those towns and my
 
02:59:40.510 --> 02:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
community also our transportation for
 
02:59:43.830 --> 02:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
buses is all from it it's all working
 
02:59:45.790 --> 02:59:45.800 align:start position:0%
cooperatively with Blue Mountain across
 
02:59:47.630 --> 02:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
the river from us which is in uh
 
02:59:50.590 --> 02:59:50.600 align:start position:0%
Bradford Vermont and Newberry Vermont
 
02:59:52.990 --> 02:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
and Wells River so and we also are
 
02:59:54.830 --> 02:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
purchasing food for the schools from
 
02:59:58.389 --> 02:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
Four Corners Farm in Newberry and it's
 
03:00:00.550 --> 03:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
all considered local and I've mentioned
 
03:00:02.750 --> 03:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
before that local control up in our neck
 
03:00:04.429 --> 03:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
of the woods is any Town that's AB
 
03:00:07.190 --> 03:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
budding or within a certain radius of
 
03:00:10.269 --> 03:00:10.279 align:start position:0%
our particular community so the fact
 
03:00:12.630 --> 03:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
that we're going to eliminate being able
 
03:00:14.990 --> 03:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
to do this business with folks with
 
03:00:17.590 --> 03:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
Farms that I can stand on my deck and
 
03:00:20.750 --> 03:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
look at them across the river um it it
 
03:00:22.269 --> 03:00:22.279 align:start position:0%
it makes it more
 
03:00:25.389 --> 03:00:25.399 align:start position:0%
difficult thank
 
03:00:28.429 --> 03:00:28.439 align:start position:0%
you R
 
03:00:31.030 --> 03:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
lakas I just wanted to point
 
03:00:34.389 --> 03:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
out or remind people this this is just a
 
03:00:34.399 --> 03:00:35.389 align:start position:0%
out or remind people this this is just a
pilot

03:00:35.389 --> 03:00:35.399 align:start position:0%
pilot
 
03:00:40.030 --> 03:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
program and it's only one District Per
 
03:00:43.590 --> 03:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
County and so it doesn't have to take at
 
03:00:47.429 --> 03:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
this this at this point in time all of
 
03:00:50.030 --> 03:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
the little ins and outs and across the
 
03:00:52.870 --> 03:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
rivers and this Dairy fireman whatever
 
03:00:55.229 --> 03:00:55.239 align:start position:0%
into consideration it's just a pilot
 
03:00:57.670 --> 03:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
program which can then when it if it
 
03:01:00.590 --> 03:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
becomes a full program if we decide it's
 
03:01:03.150 --> 03:01:03.160 align:start position:0%
worthwhile then we can add all of those
 
03:01:06.269 --> 03:01:06.279 align:start position:0%
other states and other town and make
 
03:01:08.910 --> 03:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
sure and deal with schools on the river
 
03:01:11.750 --> 03:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:15.590 --> 03:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
stuff than you
 
03:01:18.269 --> 03:01:18.279 align:start position:0%
yes represent Miler thank you Mr chair
 
03:01:20.030 --> 03:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh represent belter could you could you
 
03:01:21.550 --> 03:01:21.560 align:start position:0%
talk about the
 
03:01:25.150 --> 03:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
elimination of uh section six again on
 
03:01:27.710 --> 03:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
why that is being I know you said it
 
03:01:31.030 --> 03:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
earlier but this is new to me so can you
 
03:01:33.790 --> 03:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
explain it again please absolutely yes
 
03:01:37.349 --> 03:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh so the original section six reads all
 
03:01:38.910 --> 03:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
food purchase through the program shall
 
03:01:40.269 --> 03:01:40.279 align:start position:0%
comply with National School lunch
 
03:01:41.750 --> 03:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
program and federal Child Nutrition
 
03:01:44.110 --> 03:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
program guidelines now those guidelines
 
03:01:46.389 --> 03:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
that are being referenced are already in
 
03:01:49.990 --> 03:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
place in our USDA free lunch program we
 
03:01:51.630 --> 03:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from multiple experts
 
03:01:54.550 --> 03:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
from UNH and elsewhere that currently
 
03:01:57.070 --> 03:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
there it is it is cost prohibitive to be
 
03:01:58.550 --> 03:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
able to purchase from local in New
 
03:02:01.190 --> 03:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire farms in our current USDA free
 
03:02:03.309 --> 03:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
lunch program Because the bidding
 
03:02:05.309 --> 03:02:05.319 align:start position:0%
process is such it's mandated by the
 
03:02:07.590 --> 03:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
federal government this bidding process
 
03:02:08.950 --> 03:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
simply does not allow New Hampshire
 
03:02:10.750 --> 03:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
Farmers to come in as one of the
 
03:02:12.429 --> 03:02:12.439 align:start position:0%
cheapest options to allow for that
 
03:02:14.750 --> 03:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
purchase to happen as such that was a
 
03:02:16.750 --> 03:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
critical flaw in this bill that even if
 
03:02:19.349 --> 03:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
we pass the original bill as is we could
 
03:02:20.990 --> 03:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
make the appropriation for the money but
 
03:02:22.389 --> 03:02:22.399 align:start position:0%
that money would just have to sit there
 
03:02:23.590 --> 03:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
because it wouldn't be able to be
 
03:02:25.229 --> 03:02:25.239 align:start position:0%
expended because New Hampshire Farmers
 
03:02:28.030 --> 03:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
can't come in under that bidding process
 
03:02:30.309 --> 03:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
as it is so it had to be removed to make
 
03:02:30.319 --> 03:02:31.630 align:start position:0%
as it is so it had to be removed to make
it

03:02:31.630 --> 03:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:02:36.110 --> 03:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:39.150 --> 03:02:39.160 align:start position:0%
questions okay what was
 
03:02:42.990 --> 03:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
the the on the amendment so we haven't
 
03:02:44.910 --> 03:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
voted on the Amendment yeah
 
03:02:47.229 --> 03:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions on
 
03:02:50.030 --> 03:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment so uh we have before us
 
03:02:53.389 --> 03:02:53.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment 0381 H Madam clerk would you
 
03:02:56.070 --> 03:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:56.080 --> 03:02:59.750 align:start position:0%
 
RO

03:02:59.750 --> 03:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:59.760 --> 03:03:06.349 align:start position:0%
 
represent

03:03:06.349 --> 03:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:06.359 --> 03:03:09.070 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:03:09.070 --> 03:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:03:12.309 --> 03:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
yeah then would I
 
03:03:15.870 --> 03:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
be I would promote some amendments to
 
03:03:17.070 --> 03:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment there are parts of the
 
03:03:19.030 --> 03:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that I think are improvements
 
03:03:21.349 --> 03:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
and parts that I see as problematic I
 
03:03:22.950 --> 03:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
wondering about the process in terms of
 
03:03:22.960 --> 03:03:23.790 align:start position:0%
wondering about the process in terms of
our

03:03:23.790 --> 03:03:23.800 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:03:27.229 --> 03:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
timeline the timeline does allow for us
 
03:03:30.070 --> 03:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
to do some amending but it's
 
03:03:33.750 --> 03:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
narrow uh we will be meeting again next
 
03:03:35.630 --> 03:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
week and then according to the schedule
 
03:03:37.710 --> 03:03:37.720 align:start position:0%
which I hand out will be executing bills
 
03:03:41.710 --> 03:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
on the 7th of February and then again on
 
03:03:44.510 --> 03:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
on the 13th of February
 
03:03:46.910 --> 03:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh we have several bills that are going
 
03:03:50.750 --> 03:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
to come up on the or one more bill which
 
03:03:55.389 --> 03:03:55.399 align:start position:0%
will be there on the on the 13th or the
 
03:03:57.990 --> 03:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
12th excuse me but we have we have
 
03:04:01.190 --> 03:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
already early bills on schedule for the
 
03:04:06.990 --> 03:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
7th 1 2 3 4 five so it could be added on
 
03:04:08.630 --> 03:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
to that but amendments would have to be
 
03:04:11.590 --> 03:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
done by the by this hopefully by the six
 
03:04:14.990 --> 03:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
so we could see them
 
03:04:18.870 --> 03:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
may I yes so given that I would like to
 
03:04:18.880 --> 03:04:20.389 align:start position:0%
may I yes so given that I would like to
know

03:04:20.389 --> 03:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:04:22.950 --> 03:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
um the sponsor of the amendment and the
 
03:04:23.950 --> 03:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
committee in
 
03:04:27.309 --> 03:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
general I don't think that putting fluid
 
03:04:30.110 --> 03:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
milk back in the bill makes sense milk
 
03:04:31.469 --> 03:04:31.479 align:start position:0%
is one of the most affordable things
 
03:04:32.750 --> 03:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
that school districts Buy and they
 
03:04:35.150 --> 03:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
mostly buy locally so it shouldn't be
 
03:04:37.110 --> 03:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
part of this
 
03:04:40.630 --> 03:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
process um I think it's great to take
 
03:04:42.910 --> 03:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
out equipment but we need to put New
 
03:04:48.269 --> 03:04:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:52.429 --> 03:04:52.439 align:start position:0%
opinion repr Bel if I may just on on the
 
03:04:55.190 --> 03:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
milk one I'm not married to the concept
 
03:04:57.790 --> 03:04:57.800 align:start position:0%
but I I don't love the idea of excluding
 
03:05:00.309 --> 03:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
our milk or Dairy Farmers because this
 
03:05:02.030 --> 03:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
is as much to help the Farms as is the
 
03:05:04.190 --> 03:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
schools on the New England thing I I
 
03:05:07.790 --> 03:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
could not support this bill with New
 
03:05:11.110 --> 03:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
England May I respond yes could you
 
03:05:14.309 --> 03:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
support it if it gave a
 
03:05:18.429 --> 03:05:18.439 align:start position:0%
mileage you know 25 50 miles from New
 
03:05:18.439 --> 03:05:19.750 align:start position:0%
mileage you know 25 50 miles from New
Hampshire

03:05:19.750 --> 03:05:19.760 align:start position:0%

03:05:22.229 --> 03:05:22.239 align:start position:0%

03:05:23.750 --> 03:05:23.760 align:start position:0%

03:05:25.590 --> 03:05:25.600 align:start position:0%

03:16:44.920 --> 03:16:48.670 align:start position:0%
 
further

03:16:48.670 --> 03:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:51.110 --> 03:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
discussion Is there further discussion
 
03:16:55.269 --> 03:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
on the amendment um this doesn't it
 
03:16:57.910 --> 03:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't change anything in law that's
 
03:16:59.790 --> 03:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
currently there all it says is the
 
03:17:02.349 --> 03:17:02.359 align:start position:0%
what's what's already there is to be
 
03:17:04.990 --> 03:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
published in the student handbook to be
 
03:17:06.910 --> 03:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
available to students and parents that's
 
03:17:11.189 --> 03:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:11.199 --> 03:17:16.510 align:start position:0%
 
does

03:17:16.510 --> 03:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:18.510 --> 03:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
I know people are reading the amendment
 
03:17:23.429 --> 03:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:25.790 --> 03:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
here represent Hall do you have a
 
03:17:28.229 --> 03:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
question do we think it's in handbooks
 
03:17:30.269 --> 03:17:30.279 align:start position:0%
right now do you think or you think no
 
03:17:32.670 --> 03:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
and that's the problem no ever it's not
 
03:17:34.790 --> 03:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
well I won't I don't know it's in every
 
03:17:37.150 --> 03:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
single handbook in every single school
 
03:17:39.990 --> 03:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
but I would say no it's not and that's
 
03:17:43.510 --> 03:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
why people don't know about it because
 
03:17:45.469 --> 03:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
you know it's in law but how many people
 
03:17:50.550 --> 03:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:56.590 --> 03:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:00.189 --> 03:18:00.199 align:start position:0%

03:18:41.110 --> 03:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:44.750 --> 03:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
districts which child schools and local
 
03:18:46.750 --> 03:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
school districts aren't the
 
03:18:51.429 --> 03:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
same governments correct that's
 
03:18:51.439 --> 03:19:00.189 align:start position:0%
same governments correct that's
correct

03:19:00.189 --> 03:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:05.389 --> 03:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
okay it's it's an eror chair yes so a
 
03:19:08.750 --> 03:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
question to the chair um the the the
 
03:19:10.429 --> 03:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
bill and the
 
03:19:14.070 --> 03:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
amendment seem both both directed to
 
03:19:16.110 --> 03:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
courses that are placement and courses
 
03:19:18.910 --> 03:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
that are offered by the high
 
03:19:22.590 --> 03:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
school am I correct in that uh 7 through
 
03:19:25.349 --> 03:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
12 7 through 12 7 yeah that that thank
 
03:19:29.790 --> 03:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
you um yet 193 C12 seems to be directed
 
03:19:37.349 --> 03:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:39.670 --> 03:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
assessment I don't have my book with me
 
03:19:42.189 --> 03:19:42.199 align:start position:0%
do you have a do you have a book going
 
03:19:46.150 --> 03:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
to go get my okay I I'm
 
03:19:52.790 --> 03:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:09.229 --> 03:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:13.110 --> 03:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
552 that's a different one that's
 
03:20:16.870 --> 03:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
that is um um
 
03:20:25.830 --> 03:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:33.510 --> 03:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:40.910 --> 03:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:53.469 --> 03:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:56.150 --> 03:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
15 take another
 
03:21:07.670 --> 03:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:07.680 --> 03:21:10.830 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:21:10.830 --> 03:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:10.840 --> 03:21:13.030 align:start position:0%
 
espe

03:21:13.030 --> 03:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
espe
 
03:21:15.349 --> 03:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
yeah it appears that this is in the area
 
03:21:19.429 --> 03:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:19.439 --> 03:21:25.950 align:start position:0%
 
assessment

03:21:25.950 --> 03:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:28.429 --> 03:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
so my question to the committee is this
 
03:21:28.439 --> 03:21:31.269 align:start position:0%
so my question to the committee is this
bill

03:21:31.269 --> 03:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:39.670 --> 03:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:42.590 --> 03:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
so I can see how the author
 
03:21:45.229 --> 03:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
has taken out the Elementary grades
 
03:21:48.349 --> 03:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
which I think is a good thing to
 
03:21:51.110 --> 03:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
do but there's been two points mentioned
 
03:21:54.189 --> 03:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
here one the section law is put into and
 
03:22:02.550 --> 03:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:06.269 --> 03:22:06.279 align:start position:0%
Schools so represent can I just ask the
 
03:22:08.630 --> 03:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
author of the bill
 
03:22:13.590 --> 03:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
intent is it your intent um with this
 
03:22:17.990 --> 03:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
bill that when a when it is believed
 
03:22:20.469 --> 03:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
that the student has accomplished all
 
03:22:23.189 --> 03:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
the necessary competencies for that
 
03:22:25.590 --> 03:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
cours workk that the student should be
 
03:22:29.229 --> 03:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
eligible to move on when ready so you
 
03:22:31.469 --> 03:22:31.479 align:start position:0%
are you looking at a
 
03:22:36.670 --> 03:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
determination of um competency the only
 
03:22:39.790 --> 03:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
thing the only thing that bill was
 
03:22:43.830 --> 03:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to do was make for all schools
 
03:22:47.030 --> 03:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
including Elementary grades whatever
 
03:22:52.070 --> 03:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
that school's policies are to just print
 
03:22:55.510 --> 03:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
them in the school clearly the student
 
03:22:57.830 --> 03:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
manual that was all this was supposed to
 
03:23:01.229 --> 03:23:01.239 align:start position:0%
do it blew up into this huge thing about
 
03:23:04.150 --> 03:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
how to assess and whether you can assess
 
03:23:06.790 --> 03:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
in elementary schools and all of this
 
03:23:08.750 --> 03:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
stuff it had nothing to do with that
 
03:23:13.590 --> 03:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
because as c as rep c hadn't said that
 
03:23:17.389 --> 03:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
stuff has already exists the only thing
 
03:23:20.030 --> 03:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
this bill was supposed to do was say put
 
03:23:22.150 --> 03:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
it in the student handbook whatever it
 
03:23:25.349 --> 03:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
is whatever the school has just put it
 
03:23:28.670 --> 03:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
in the student handbook that's it it
 
03:23:30.429 --> 03:23:30.439 align:start position:0%
didn't get written up quite like I
 
03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to begin with this we were trying
 
03:23:37.269 --> 03:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
to at any rate it was supposed to be a
 
03:23:39.790 --> 03:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
very simple bill it was a few lines that
 
03:23:44.070 --> 03:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
I submitted to ol it turned into a big
 
03:23:47.229 --> 03:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
argument about things that this doesn't
 
03:23:47.239 --> 03:23:48.590 align:start position:0%
argument about things that this doesn't
even

03:23:48.590 --> 03:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
even
 
03:23:52.950 --> 03:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
cover question yes when you say print it
 
03:23:54.630 --> 03:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
in the school manual some schools don't
 
03:23:56.830 --> 03:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
even print them they just have it online
 
03:23:58.910 --> 03:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
so that's fine if it were online and
 
03:24:01.229 --> 03:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
there was a policy as representative T
 
03:24:03.229 --> 03:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned so in the school manual that's
 
03:24:05.349 --> 03:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
online it just puts a link to it do they
 
03:24:06.590 --> 03:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
have to print the whole thing out or
 
03:24:09.229 --> 03:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
just a link that's already so it's
 
03:24:11.870 --> 03:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
already published so the idea is so that
 
03:24:13.550 --> 03:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
a student or a parent can know what the
 
03:24:16.110 --> 03:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
policies are that's that's it but
 
03:24:18.550 --> 03:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
they're already published well they're
 
03:24:18.560 --> 03:24:19.469 align:start position:0%
they're already published well they're
not

03:24:19.469 --> 03:24:19.479 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:24:21.630 --> 03:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
they're publish I don't mean like
 
03:24:24.950 --> 03:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
printed but yes if the school has them
 
03:24:27.309 --> 03:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
if the school H yes just put them where
 
03:24:29.429 --> 03:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
they're in the what would be the
 
03:24:32.070 --> 03:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
equivalent of the school
 
03:24:34.070 --> 03:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
handbook because most schools don't
 
03:24:36.110 --> 03:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
print handb well
 
03:24:39.710 --> 03:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
that's on on online where there is a
 
03:24:41.229 --> 03:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
section that is that students and
 
03:24:43.710 --> 03:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
parents are supposed to read right which
 
03:24:46.550 --> 03:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
is the student handbook which might be
 
03:24:46.560 --> 03:24:48.189 align:start position:0%
is the student handbook which might be
online

03:24:48.189 --> 03:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
online
 
03:24:50.630 --> 03:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
only just put it there so it can be
 
03:24:52.910 --> 03:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
found by students and parents that's
 
03:24:55.550 --> 03:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
03:24:57.830 --> 03:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's is there any more discussion on
 
03:24:57.840 --> 03:25:01.349 align:start position:0%
that's is there any more discussion on
this

03:25:01.349 --> 03:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:05.150 --> 03:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
bill we have yes represent Cas Ken uh
 
03:25:08.550 --> 03:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
just want to add that these policies are
 
03:25:10.469 --> 03:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
already on student
 
03:25:10.479 --> 03:25:13.389 align:start position:0%
already on student
websites

03:25:13.389 --> 03:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
websites
 
03:25:14.910 --> 03:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
they're already
 
03:25:17.349 --> 03:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
public anyway they're already there
 
03:25:17.359 --> 03:25:18.590 align:start position:0%
public anyway they're already there
representative

03:25:18.590 --> 03:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:25:20.870 --> 03:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
McDonald I guess then I have a question
 
03:25:23.189 --> 03:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
for you representative cascaden do we
 
03:25:25.510 --> 03:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
know that it's on every school's
 
03:25:28.389 --> 03:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
handbook and would this bill allow it to
 
03:25:31.950 --> 03:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:34.309 --> 03:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
handbook I can't vouch for all the
 
03:25:38.070 --> 03:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
schools so further discussion yeah I
 
03:25:39.469 --> 03:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
know what you're cordel you had your
 
03:25:43.070 --> 03:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
hand up uh just uh I know um it's been
 
03:25:45.349 --> 03:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
said that this is in policies I'm not
 
03:25:47.990 --> 03:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
sure if it's in every school district's
 
03:25:50.189 --> 03:25:50.199 align:start position:0%
policies um I know the school boards
 
03:25:52.790 --> 03:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
Association maybe has a a sample policy
 
03:25:54.670 --> 03:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
to that regard but I I don't know what
 
03:25:57.910 --> 03:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
that means um and I know looking at my
 
03:26:00.710 --> 03:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
district trying to go through and find
 
03:26:04.469 --> 03:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
policies is not the easiest thing in the
 
03:26:08.990 --> 03:26:09.000 align:start position:0%

state advisory committee on the
 
03:33:21.710 --> 03:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
education of children students with

disabilities and they talked about um
 
03:33:26.389 --> 03:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
they support this bill provided it's
 
03:33:28.510 --> 03:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
amended to remove the part that says
 
03:33:29.990 --> 03:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
School District shall impose no
 
03:33:32.189 --> 03:33:32.199 align:start position:0%
conditions or restrictions um and then
 
03:33:33.910 --> 03:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
they went on to talk about safety
 
03:33:35.510 --> 03:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
concerns and things like that when we
 
03:33:38.269 --> 03:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
looked at the the statement in the bill
 
03:33:41.070 --> 03:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
it says that they will impose no
 
03:33:43.550 --> 03:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
conditions or restrictions except those
 
03:33:45.030 --> 03:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
necessary to ensure the safety of
 
03:33:47.070 --> 03:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
children in the program so we feel that
 
03:33:50.150 --> 03:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
the the comments that they made here
 
03:33:51.950 --> 03:33:51.960 align:start position:0%

03:39:09.239 --> 03:39:24.510 align:start position:0%
 
buing

03:39:24.510 --> 03:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:26.990 --> 03:39:27.000 align:start position:0%

OTP just
 
03:39:35.070 --> 03:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
Bel or I don't know several people
 
03:39:37.309 --> 03:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
support the OTP yeah I'll support the
 
03:39:40.950 --> 03:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
OTP not the not the amendment well make
 
03:39:44.030 --> 03:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
the motion for the OTP then uh Mr
 
03:39:46.830 --> 03:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I would like to move uh OTP on
 
03:39:51.389 --> 03:39:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:54.389 --> 03:39:54.399 align:start position:0%
it represent
 
03:39:57.229 --> 03:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
cordelli um I think cross District
 
03:40:00.550 --> 03:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
bullying is an important topic we heard
 
03:40:04.469 --> 03:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh quite a bit of testimony about um a
 
03:40:08.830 --> 03:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
particular case um and the fact that uh
 
03:40:11.670 --> 03:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
District um would not investigate
 
03:40:15.189 --> 03:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
because it was not in statute um so I
 
03:40:18.070 --> 03:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
think it's incumbent that we make sure
 
03:40:21.070 --> 03:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
it is in statute and that uh districts
 
03:40:25.110 --> 03:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
know that U the uh resident district for
 
03:40:28.990 --> 03:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
the bully needs to do the investigation
 
03:40:32.189 --> 03:40:32.199 align:start position:0%
um buling is such an important topic uh
 
03:40:36.870 --> 03:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't let this um a slip by
 
03:40:41.950 --> 03:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
us and uh I'll I'll speak to as ER II uh
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
we did have communication on this from
 
03:40:47.429 --> 03:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
uh a professor up in North Country
 
03:40:49.389 --> 03:40:49.399 align:start position:0%
dealing with that particular situation I
 
03:40:50.870 --> 03:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
don't need to name the name of the
 
03:40:54.110 --> 03:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
school districts but absolutely saying
 
03:40:56.030 --> 03:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
we need to do something with the bill as
 
03:40:58.510 --> 03:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
it was submitted to us and recommend
 
03:41:00.229 --> 03:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
highly recommended ought to pass because
 
03:41:01.950 --> 03:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
there has been a significant issue with
 
03:41:04.590 --> 03:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
the bullying going across districts and
 
03:41:07.550 --> 03:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
impacting uh the life of of a student in
 
03:41:10.070 --> 03:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
one of those schools significantly so I
 
03:41:13.550 --> 03:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
I think this bill is needed as it was
 
03:41:16.910 --> 03:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
presented represent
 
03:41:19.590 --> 03:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
Miler there's no doubt that this is an
 
03:41:22.830 --> 03:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
awful thing to happen to a student and
 
03:41:25.110 --> 03:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
it needs to be addressed
 
03:41:27.590 --> 03:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
however during the testimony there were
 
03:41:29.830 --> 03:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
several questions
 
03:41:33.550 --> 03:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
raised um about dealing with Independent
 
03:41:36.389 --> 03:41:36.399 align:start position:0%
Schools dealing with students uh from
 
03:41:39.189 --> 03:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
outside the state I and if you had a
 
03:41:41.950 --> 03:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
bullying situation ation for a student
 
03:41:43.670 --> 03:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
for example in
 
03:41:46.469 --> 03:41:46.479 align:start position:0%
Ohio uh what's the jurisdiction as it
 
03:41:49.870 --> 03:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
relates to dealing with that so although
 
03:41:51.630 --> 03:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
this is a very important issue and I
 
03:41:54.149 --> 03:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
totally agree with the intent of the
 
03:41:56.670 --> 03:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
motion I think there are some issues
 
03:42:00.550 --> 03:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
that were uncovered during the testimony
 
03:42:03.309 --> 03:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
that need further look before we
 
03:42:07.149 --> 03:42:07.159 align:start position:0%
actually place this in uh to statutes so
 
03:42:10.750 --> 03:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
I will be voting against the OTP and if
 
03:42:14.189 --> 03:42:14.199 align:start position:0%
the OTP fails I will then put a motion
 
03:42:17.030 --> 03:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
for inim study on this so we can have a
 
03:42:20.189 --> 03:42:20.199 align:start position:0%
broader look at the legal implications
 
03:42:23.189 --> 03:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
and who's responsible Etc thank you
 
03:42:23.199 --> 03:42:24.990 align:start position:0%
and who's responsible Etc thank you
representative

03:42:24.990 --> 03:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:42:27.990 --> 03:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair I um I I
 
03:42:29.309 --> 03:42:29.319 align:start position:0%
previously brought some of this up but I
 
03:42:32.510 --> 03:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
had some very uh steep concerns over
 
03:42:34.149 --> 03:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
part of existing law here that this
 
03:42:37.550 --> 03:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
amends in part one uh rather Roman One
 
03:42:40.269 --> 03:42:40.279 align:start position:0%
Part B and I have drafted an amendment M
 
03:42:42.630 --> 03:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
I would like to introduce at this time
 
03:42:45.590 --> 03:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment 2024
 
03:42:47.309 --> 03:42:47.319 align:start position:0%
02558 uh the committee should have
 
03:42:54.550 --> 03:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:04.990 --> 03:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:08.550 --> 03:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
proceeding I would move uh a to pass on
 
03:43:10.990 --> 03:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment is there a second on the
 
03:43:14.429 --> 03:43:14.439 align:start position:0%
amendment that uh represent beler is
 
03:43:17.790 --> 03:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
proposing thank you so uh represent
 
03:43:19.750 --> 03:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
beler would like to speak further on
 
03:43:22.750 --> 03:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
your Amendment yes thank you Mr chair so
 
03:43:24.349 --> 03:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the current language
 
03:43:28.469 --> 03:43:28.479 align:start position:0%
here in Roman one uh Item B the first
 
03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
sentence occurs off of school property
 
03:43:32.750 --> 03:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
or outside of a school sponsored event
 
03:43:34.750 --> 03:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh or activity so this is not a school
 
03:43:36.950 --> 03:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
related event the second sentence then
 
03:43:39.429 --> 03:43:39.439 align:start position:0%
goes on to if the conduct interferes
 
03:43:40.750 --> 03:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
with a people people's educational
 
03:43:42.630 --> 03:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
opportunities and subst or substantially
 
03:43:44.309 --> 03:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
disrupts the orderly operations of the
 
03:43:46.710 --> 03:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
school or School sponsored activity or
 
03:43:50.229 --> 03:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
event um so that language in the second
 
03:43:53.710 --> 03:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
sentence is derived um quite closely
 
03:43:55.309 --> 03:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
from the language of a Supreme Court
 
03:43:58.309 --> 03:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
decision in the in the case of Tinker um
 
03:44:00.590 --> 03:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
which is a several multiple decades old
 
03:44:02.910 --> 03:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
predent the trouble is that there was
 
03:44:05.670 --> 03:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
another Supreme Court president in
 
03:44:08.349 --> 03:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
2021 that took another look at this
 
03:44:11.030 --> 03:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
issue and further clarified this and
 
03:44:13.389 --> 03:44:13.399 align:start position:0%
they specifically said that the decision
 
03:44:15.830 --> 03:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
in Tinker from which that language is
 
03:44:18.950 --> 03:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
derived only applies to circumstances
 
03:44:22.990 --> 03:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
happening in school or at a school event
 
03:44:25.189 --> 03:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
as such the language as currently
 
03:44:27.790 --> 03:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
existing in law is already not in
 
03:44:29.269 --> 03:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
compliance with this Supreme Court
 
03:44:30.630 --> 03:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
decision is therefore I believe
 
03:44:32.630 --> 03:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional when we go on to add
 
03:44:34.710 --> 03:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
cross distric to it we actually exceed
 
03:44:36.309 --> 03:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
that a little bit further so what I have
 
03:44:40.110 --> 03:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
done is I have redrafted Item B in this
 
03:44:41.349 --> 03:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
bill and that's the only thing that
 
03:44:44.590 --> 03:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
changes is Item B for out of school and
 
03:44:46.750 --> 03:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
out of school event activities and I
 
03:44:48.910 --> 03:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
have imported the entire piece of
 
03:44:51.349 --> 03:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
language from the Supreme Court decision
 
03:44:54.950 --> 03:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
in 2021 that outlines the specific
 
03:44:58.750 --> 03:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which a school is
 
03:45:01.950 --> 03:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
authorized to regulate off-campus speech
 
03:45:04.309 --> 03:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
of students so I would ask that you
 
03:45:07.990 --> 03:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:10.830 --> 03:45:10.840 align:start position:0%
you further discussion
 
03:45:14.070 --> 03:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
repr McDonald thank you Mr chair and
 
03:45:16.030 --> 03:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
with the utmost respect for my colleague
 
03:45:18.510 --> 03:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
who brought this amendment forward I
 
03:45:20.070 --> 03:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
personally will not be supporting this
 
03:45:22.630 --> 03:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
amendment I do not like on line four
 
03:45:24.590 --> 03:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
specifically where it says constitutes
 
03:45:27.469 --> 03:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
serious or severe bullying I think the
 
03:45:28.870 --> 03:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
inclusion of those words will leave
 
03:45:31.149 --> 03:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
students left behind and who defines if
 
03:45:34.309 --> 03:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
bullying is serious or severe that seems
 
03:45:37.349 --> 03:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
a bit vague in its language so I will
 
03:45:39.950 --> 03:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
not be supporting this amendment because
 
03:45:41.870 --> 03:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
the bill as presented is strongest and I
 
03:45:44.110 --> 03:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to vote for the bill
 
03:45:47.510 --> 03:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
as introduced to us thank you representa
 
03:45:51.590 --> 03:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
cascaden um I agree uh to a certain
 
03:45:53.990 --> 03:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
extent with representative beler that
 
03:45:56.550 --> 03:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
Tinker versus de Mo um that would
 
03:46:00.590 --> 03:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
violate um the First Amendment however
 
03:46:03.110 --> 03:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment I'm not sure
 
03:46:06.110 --> 03:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
does what was intended
 
03:46:09.870 --> 03:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
either um I think what needs to be
 
03:46:11.710 --> 03:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
thought through is that schools don't
 
03:46:15.110 --> 03:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
have investigative officers on staff
 
03:46:17.990 --> 03:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
they have a process of questioning that
 
03:46:19.950 --> 03:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
they can bring a student in
 
03:46:23.110 --> 03:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
independently question them and then
 
03:46:24.950 --> 03:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
form a decision on whether yes there's
 
03:46:27.550 --> 03:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
been bullying or no there hasn't been
 
03:46:30.510 --> 03:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
bullying and that works okay when you
 
03:46:32.990 --> 03:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
have two New Hampshire superintendant
 
03:46:34.309 --> 03:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
that can
 
03:46:37.269 --> 03:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
collaborate but you don't always have
 
03:46:39.590 --> 03:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
that and what happens on the internet
 
03:46:42.550 --> 03:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
interet how I mean you could I could
 
03:46:44.630 --> 03:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
just think you spend a whole week
 
03:46:47.389 --> 03:46:47.399 align:start position:0%
investigating a case from somebody from
 
03:46:50.070 --> 03:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
another state who keeps sending
 
03:46:52.349 --> 03:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
something to say three or four students
 
03:46:55.349 --> 03:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
in a public school obviously causing A
 
03:46:58.550 --> 03:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
disruption at that point and I think it
 
03:47:00.830 --> 03:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
has to become a police
 
03:47:05.110 --> 03:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
matter because schools are not
 
03:47:07.790 --> 03:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
detectives do I think cyber bullying and
 
03:47:10.309 --> 03:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
bullying is a problem
 
03:47:15.429 --> 03:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
yes and how can we develop a
 
03:47:18.590 --> 03:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
bill for New Hampshire schools I really
 
03:47:20.870 --> 03:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
don't care about other states but I care
 
03:47:25.349 --> 03:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
about our kids to protect our kids from
 
03:47:27.630 --> 03:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
these incidents and I think we need to
 
03:47:30.149 --> 03:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
be careful about that there's a furer
 
03:47:32.830 --> 03:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
violation any school you
 
03:47:35.910 --> 03:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
call if it's not one of your
 
03:47:38.469 --> 03:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
colleagues you know if you say hey is so
 
03:47:40.349 --> 03:47:40.359 align:start position:0%
and so a student
 
03:47:43.910 --> 03:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
there they better say no or I can't
 
03:47:47.110 --> 03:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
disclose that because they
 
03:47:51.030 --> 03:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
can't and how do they know who's calling
 
03:47:54.269 --> 03:47:54.279 align:start position:0%
them is not somebody just
 
03:47:57.630 --> 03:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
calling um you just can't be trusting of
 
03:48:00.950 --> 03:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
that but I would like to see something
 
03:48:04.429 --> 03:48:04.439 align:start position:0%
in paper that does allow New Hampshire
 
03:48:07.229 --> 03:48:07.239 align:start position:0%
superintendent to collaborate on such
 
03:48:09.870 --> 03:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
situations that occur that are causing A
 
03:48:11.950 --> 03:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
disruption in their schools and that's
 
03:48:13.510 --> 03:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
why I think we need a little bit of time
 
03:48:14.870 --> 03:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
for an Norm
 
03:48:17.590 --> 03:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
study further
 
03:48:21.149 --> 03:48:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:29.550 --> 03:48:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:33.790 --> 03:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
amendment okay I I don't understand
 
03:48:36.149 --> 03:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you failure to follow rules
 
03:48:40.229 --> 03:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
concerning lessons I
 
03:48:42.429 --> 03:48:42.439 align:start position:0%
if I may address that so I I didn't want
 
03:48:44.349 --> 03:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
to pretend that I was capable of
 
03:48:46.229 --> 03:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
conceiving of all possible circumstances
 
03:48:48.149 --> 03:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
in which bullying could occur so I
 
03:48:49.910 --> 03:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
simply took the entirety of the language
 
03:48:51.950 --> 03:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
outlined um and by the way this Supreme
 
03:48:53.269 --> 03:48:53.279 align:start position:0%
Court decision was not narrow it was an
 
03:48:56.070 --> 03:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
8:1 decision with the majority opinion
 
03:48:58.990 --> 03:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
by uh justice Brier um and this was his
 
03:49:04.910 --> 03:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:07.670 --> 03:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
opinion further
 
03:49:10.790 --> 03:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
discussion from the committee
 
03:49:15.189 --> 03:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
I do have a question for um those that
 
03:49:16.710 --> 03:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
have been in the business here of
 
03:49:20.269 --> 03:49:20.279 align:start position:0%
administration in the state
 
03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
um there was a situation in the North
 
03:49:22.920 --> 03:49:24.630 align:start position:0%
um there was a situation in the North
Country

03:49:24.630 --> 03:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
Country
 
03:49:28.830 --> 03:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
SAU and were both those superintendant
 
03:49:30.790 --> 03:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
talking with you just made mention it
 
03:49:32.950 --> 03:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
it'll work where you know for example we
 
03:49:34.590 --> 03:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
always have a great relationship where
 
03:49:37.149 --> 03:49:37.159 align:start position:0%
we are with with Plymouth and
 
03:49:39.550 --> 03:49:39.560 align:start position:0%
Woodsville um is there such an
 
03:49:41.349 --> 03:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
arrangement up there and how come it
 
03:49:44.149 --> 03:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
went as far as it had to go all the way
 
03:49:46.110 --> 03:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
down to
 
03:49:48.630 --> 03:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
conquer because the media only published
 
03:49:52.070 --> 03:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
half the story I I have I have spoken to
 
03:49:54.309 --> 03:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
both of those superintendent yeah uhuh
 
03:49:59.110 --> 03:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
and it had been resolved the bully was
 
03:50:01.550 --> 03:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
disciplined and the student apparently
 
03:50:03.389 --> 03:50:03.399 align:start position:0%
wasn't that was being
 
03:50:06.309 --> 03:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
bullied um was in the district only for
 
03:50:07.630 --> 03:50:07.640 align:start position:0%
a few
 
03:50:12.189 --> 03:50:12.199 align:start position:0%
months um sad case yeah but they did
 
03:50:14.110 --> 03:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
work together and they did work through
 
03:50:16.550 --> 03:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
it Mr
 
03:50:18.429 --> 03:50:18.439 align:start position:0%
yes if my
 
03:50:18.439 --> 03:50:19.950 align:start position:0%
yes if my
rection

03:50:19.950 --> 03:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
rection
 
03:50:24.110 --> 03:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
my thoughts are right when they
 
03:50:26.630 --> 03:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
presented when it that question was
 
03:50:28.990 --> 03:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
asked and the answer was that the
 
03:50:31.070 --> 03:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
parents did want did not want to go to
 
03:50:35.309 --> 03:50:35.319 align:start position:0%
the police um and they wanted that's why
 
03:50:37.910 --> 03:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
they pressured the schools to resolve
 
03:50:40.429 --> 03:50:40.439 align:start position:0%
the issue um and it was because they
 
03:50:45.349 --> 03:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
were uh didn't have uh full
 
03:50:48.349 --> 03:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
um full power of English language and
 
03:50:50.149 --> 03:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
they they were feeling as though they
 
03:50:52.189 --> 03:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
would be discriminated against if they'd
 
03:50:54.309 --> 03:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
gone to the police I think that was what
 
03:50:58.469 --> 03:50:58.479 align:start position:0%
my re recollection is of their
 
03:51:02.030 --> 03:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
testimony so my followup to all this is
 
03:51:06.189 --> 03:51:06.199 align:start position:0%
that why then did the attorney to the
 
03:51:11.349 --> 03:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
district advise not to go for for with
 
03:51:15.870 --> 03:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
this anybody have an answer
 
03:51:18.070 --> 03:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's assess in the letter right here
 
03:51:20.070 --> 03:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
that we got from this individual now
 
03:51:21.990 --> 03:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
this is a person that's an elderly
 
03:51:24.429 --> 03:51:24.439 align:start position:0%
person that's also I guess a professor
 
03:51:27.550 --> 03:51:27.560 align:start position:0%
up that way at the sau's attorney's
 
03:51:29.269 --> 03:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
Direction the principal superintendent
 
03:51:30.750 --> 03:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
and School District's board chair
 
03:51:35.750 --> 03:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:39.309 --> 03:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
student Mr chair if I may I I I would
 
03:51:44.189 --> 03:51:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:47.429 --> 03:51:47.439 align:start position:0%
liability yeah it could be that but
 
03:51:49.110 --> 03:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
they're looking at the Safety and
 
03:51:51.389 --> 03:51:51.399 align:start position:0%
Security of a student I would think that
 
03:51:53.710 --> 03:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
it could go the other way
 
03:51:53.720 --> 03:51:56.030 align:start position:0%
it could go the other way
too

03:51:56.030 --> 03:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
too
 
03:52:01.070 --> 03:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
so represent cordelli uh thank you um I
 
03:52:02.790 --> 03:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
I cannot support the amendment for a
 
03:52:04.510 --> 03:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons um some of which
 
03:52:07.229 --> 03:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
follows on to representative McDonald um
 
03:52:09.670 --> 03:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
first I think this changes the def of
 
03:52:11.389 --> 03:52:11.399 align:start position:0%
bullying in the
 
03:52:11.399 --> 03:52:12.910 align:start position:0%
bullying in the
statute

03:52:12.910 --> 03:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:52:12.920 --> 03:52:14.429 align:start position:0%
statute
secondly

03:52:14.429 --> 03:52:14.439 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
03:52:17.670 --> 03:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
um I see where part of this is taken
 
03:52:20.510 --> 03:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
from um the attachment of a course I
 
03:52:24.309 --> 03:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
don't know if that was direct ruling or
 
03:52:27.229 --> 03:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
um not but the last part or any speech
 
03:52:28.870 --> 03:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
not normally protected by First
 
03:52:31.750 --> 03:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment standards I don't see in the
 
03:52:33.910 --> 03:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
attachment of the Court decision so I
 
03:52:36.110 --> 03:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
don't know where that came from so it
 
03:52:38.750 --> 03:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
was not pulled from um the court
 
03:52:40.870 --> 03:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
decision as far as I can
 
03:52:43.950 --> 03:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
see further discussion represent
 
03:52:46.630 --> 03:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
beler sorry if I if I may respond to the
 
03:52:49.269 --> 03:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
that part that indeed was pulled from
 
03:52:51.229 --> 03:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
the uh Supreme Court opinion it may have
 
03:52:52.349 --> 03:52:52.359 align:start position:0%
it may not have been on the particular
 
03:52:54.429 --> 03:52:54.439 align:start position:0%
page I provided but it was it was
 
03:52:56.389 --> 03:52:56.399 align:start position:0%
highlighted in a separate part also by
 
03:53:01.189 --> 03:53:01.199 align:start position:0%

03:53:06.590 --> 03:53:06.600 align:start position:0%

petno this um particular bill has been
 
03:54:38.229 --> 03:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
problematic for me I can't quite wrap my
 
03:54:40.990 --> 03:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
head around the cross District bullying
 
03:54:43.670 --> 03:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to the use of
 
03:54:46.590 --> 03:54:46.600 align:start position:0%
cell phones
 
03:54:49.429 --> 03:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
and whatever devices we that the kids
 
03:54:53.469 --> 03:54:53.479 align:start position:0%
have access to and i would support the
 
03:54:55.550 --> 03:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
motion for interim study should it come
 
03:54:57.469 --> 03:54:57.479 align:start position:0%
up at a later
 
03:55:00.870 --> 03:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
moment further discussion representative
 
03:55:03.149 --> 03:55:03.159 align:start position:0%
McDonald again with respect for my
 
03:55:04.790 --> 03:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
friend and colleague I'd have to
 
03:55:07.910 --> 03:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
disagree I think it is unfortunate that
 
03:55:10.309 --> 03:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
the particular incident occurred that
 
03:55:13.349 --> 03:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
was presented to US during testimony and
 
03:55:15.630 --> 03:55:15.640 align:start position:0%
we have also received testimony that if
 
03:55:18.830 --> 03:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
a bill like this had been ratified prior
 
03:55:21.429 --> 03:55:21.439 align:start position:0%
that it could have caused less of a
 
03:55:23.309 --> 03:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
traumatic experience on The Afflicted
 
03:55:25.269 --> 03:55:25.279 align:start position:0%
student and family in terms of dealing
 
03:55:27.710 --> 03:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
with the incident I'd also like to add
 
03:55:29.710 --> 03:55:29.720 align:start position:0%
that it would be negligent of this
 
03:55:31.590 --> 03:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
committee to assume that future
 
03:55:33.870 --> 03:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
incidents of bullying even of the
 
03:55:36.389 --> 03:55:36.399 align:start position:0%
magnitude are not to occur again and
 
03:55:39.710 --> 03:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
this bill could be preventative in terms
 
03:55:41.950 --> 03:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
of establishing a plan to really deal
 
03:55:43.830 --> 03:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
with those cases so I think it's of the
 
03:55:46.510 --> 03:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
utmost importance that we pass this bill
 
03:55:48.790 --> 03:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
now as opposed to put in inrm study
 
03:55:53.030 --> 03:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
because this could happen again further

bill thank you I'd like to move on to
 
04:07:24.109 --> 04:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:26.429 --> 04:07:26.439 align:start position:0%

with the um intent of the original Bill
 
04:07:52.309 --> 04:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh I am not sure that the 49%
 
04:07:56.229 --> 04:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
proficiency level is the right one so
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
therefore I am uh offering ought to pass
 
04:08:01.309 --> 04:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
on Amendment
 
04:08:01.319 --> 04:08:04.469 align:start position:0%
on Amendment
0389

04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:08.309 --> 04:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
H is there a second second
 
04:08:11.590 --> 04:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
represent Ford seconds the amendment
 
04:08:14.550 --> 04:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
0389 H made by represent
 
04:08:16.710 --> 04:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
cordelli represent
 
04:08:19.149 --> 04:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
Celli you speak to it you did speak a
 
04:08:21.429 --> 04:08:21.439 align:start position:0%
little bit to it um just a little bit
 
04:08:25.590 --> 04:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
more okay um on the amendment um the
 
04:08:28.710 --> 04:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
proficiency level um is
 
04:08:31.469 --> 04:08:31.479 align:start position:0%
reduced uh so in order to
 
04:08:35.070 --> 04:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
qualify um for an EFA under this
 
04:08:37.229 --> 04:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
legislation uh the student would have to
 
04:08:39.269 --> 04:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
be in the bottom
 
04:08:43.590 --> 04:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
25% of proficiency levels in mathematics
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:50.790 --> 04:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
science forur this
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
discussion represent luno sure thanks
 
04:08:58.309 --> 04:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
very much so so in um in in moving this
 
04:08:59.990 --> 04:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
forward and supporting in in your
 
04:09:02.389 --> 04:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
support of the amendment would you um
 
04:09:05.189 --> 04:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
would you also support um initiatives
 
04:09:08.309 --> 04:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
that would um improve the uh
 
04:09:11.830 --> 04:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
proficiency level in um in school
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
districts um I've tried to improve
 
04:09:20.830 --> 04:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
04:09:25.710 --> 04:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
Tanner yeah I I'm a little bit confused
 
04:09:30.550 --> 04:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
with the um uh bottom 25% Proficiency in
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
mathematics so you have a scale of one
 
04:09:37.030 --> 04:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
to four on proficient on the assessment
 
04:09:39.830 --> 04:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
and no number two on that is proficiency
 
04:09:42.910 --> 04:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:45.070 --> 04:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
about I don't know what you're talking
 
04:09:46.229 --> 04:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
about whether you're talking about the
 
04:09:46.239 --> 04:09:48.070 align:start position:0%
about whether you're talking about the
bottom

04:09:48.070 --> 04:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
04:09:53.070 --> 04:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
25% being in in the fourth category or
 
04:09:56.109 --> 04:09:56.119 align:start position:0%
which is basic or are you talking about
 
04:10:00.070 --> 04:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
not having 20 at least 25% in the
 
04:10:02.389 --> 04:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
proficiency um if you look at the
 
04:10:05.830 --> 04:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
dashboard I think um on this state
 
04:10:08.710 --> 04:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
department website the I platform
 
04:10:12.429 --> 04:10:12.439 align:start position:0%
by by platform database um you can get a
 
04:10:17.229 --> 04:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
listing um of proficiency levels and so
 
04:10:22.550 --> 04:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
um it's broken into the top 25 schools
 
04:10:26.590 --> 04:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
bottom and the bottom 25% of
 
04:10:30.309 --> 04:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
schools so you're talking about 25% of
 
04:10:34.550 --> 04:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
schools not 25% of proficiency 25% of
 
04:10:36.630 --> 04:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
schools in terms of their proficiency
 
04:10:39.990 --> 04:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
levels but I don't know if that's what
 
04:10:43.309 --> 04:10:43.319 align:start position:0%
this says but that's why it's kind of
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:06.359 --> 04:11:11.830 align:start position:0%
 
me

04:11:11.830 --> 04:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:14.630 --> 04:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
I I would say if you look at you're
 
04:11:17.590 --> 04:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
talking about a school or School
 
04:11:20.189 --> 04:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
District with an agre aggregate
 
04:11:22.189 --> 04:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
performance level in the bottom
 
04:11:24.950 --> 04:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
25% of proficiency and in either one of
 
04:11:29.870 --> 04:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:32.710 --> 04:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
areas yes we're not talking strictly
 
04:11:34.910 --> 04:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
either math either we're talking the
 
04:11:36.550 --> 04:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
whole nine yards reading language arts
 
04:11:38.149 --> 04:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
and science
 
04:11:41.670 --> 04:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
and it's the bottom quartile of terms of
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
proficiency that in if a district lays
 
04:11:46.910 --> 04:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
within that then those students there
 
04:11:48.030 --> 04:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:11:51.109 --> 04:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
eligible represent Kaden just a question
 
04:11:53.590 --> 04:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
as to why we would ex exclude public
 
04:11:53.600 --> 04:12:06.269 align:start position:0%
as to why we would ex exclude public

Oh I thought you
 
04:12:35.269 --> 04:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
were representative Heath I don't have a
 
04:12:38.349 --> 04:12:38.359 align:start position:0%
response to represent K's question I
 
04:12:41.870 --> 04:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
have another comment to make gon Cas Kon
 
04:12:43.630 --> 04:12:43.640 align:start position:0%
is there an answer to that question why
 
04:12:47.790 --> 04:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:50.030 --> 04:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
schools uh in in terms of the amendment
 
04:12:52.429 --> 04:12:52.439 align:start position:0%
I was just working off of the original
 
04:12:52.439 --> 04:12:54.510 align:start position:0%
I was just working off of the original
bill

04:12:54.510 --> 04:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:12:57.710 --> 04:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't answer the question yeah
 
04:13:00.670 --> 04:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
represent Heath my comment is more uh
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
General in nature Over The Last 5 Years
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
our school districts our country has
 
04:13:07.830 --> 04:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
gone through the worst
 
04:13:10.590 --> 04:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
upheaval that we've seen in over 100
 
04:13:14.550 --> 04:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
years um to put a bill in place like
 
04:13:19.189 --> 04:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
this at a time where kids were out of
 
04:13:21.670 --> 04:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
school we've seen kids leave school
 
04:13:23.910 --> 04:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
we've seen come back to school we've
 
04:13:27.149 --> 04:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
seen an increase on mental health issues
 
04:13:31.229 --> 04:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
there have been the pandemic caused so
 
04:13:33.910 --> 04:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
many different issues for so many
 
04:13:36.189 --> 04:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
reasons I just don't think this is the
 
04:13:38.229 --> 04:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
time or place do I believe we should
 
04:13:41.910 --> 04:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
have equity for all kids absolutely do I
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
want to see my city of Manchester
 
04:13:47.469 --> 04:13:47.479 align:start position:0%
performing at the average or above
 
04:13:49.750 --> 04:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely but you know what when I hear
 
04:13:52.710 --> 04:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
the stories and I listen to Educators
 
04:13:54.630 --> 04:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
talk about what's been going on across
 
04:13:59.510 --> 04:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
the country in in my state this just
 
04:14:02.910 --> 04:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
it's not fair to do this to our
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
Educators our families it just would be
 
04:14:10.269 --> 04:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
another nail in the coffin of public
 
04:14:13.830 --> 04:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
education I want to respond to that
 
04:14:17.149 --> 04:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
and we have seen and we're looking at
 
04:14:20.309 --> 04:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
math scores we've seen this going on for
 
04:14:23.189 --> 04:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
over a decade it's not a result of what
 
04:14:26.269 --> 04:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
happened with the covid pandemic uh
 
04:14:28.670 --> 04:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
we've had a slippage in that and that's
 
04:14:30.269 --> 04:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
what we had the task force which was
 
04:14:33.550 --> 04:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
headed by at that time Paul leather and
 
04:14:36.750 --> 04:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
they came out saying this needs a lot a
 
04:14:40.149 --> 04:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
lot of work and so mathematics has been
 
04:14:43.269 --> 04:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
not we have not really always fared as
 
04:14:45.389 --> 04:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
the way we should be refering with that
 
04:14:48.070 --> 04:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
subject for many years not just result
 
04:14:51.389 --> 04:14:51.399 align:start position:0%
of covid can I respond to that
 
04:14:54.429 --> 04:14:54.439 align:start position:0%
yeah how often has the state of New
 
04:14:57.670 --> 04:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire provided funding for local
 
04:15:00.109 --> 04:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
school Improvement when in our last
 
04:15:02.510 --> 04:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
budget did you see money to go to the
 
04:15:04.670 --> 04:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
department first of all we talked about
 
04:15:06.389 --> 04:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education not having
 
04:15:10.109 --> 04:15:10.119 align:start position:0%
any curriculum people we've talked about
 
04:15:13.229 --> 04:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
the the levels of support in title one
 
04:15:15.309 --> 04:15:15.319 align:start position:0%
yes there are levels of support coming
 
04:15:17.030 --> 04:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
but we haven't seen teachers brought
 
04:15:19.109 --> 04:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
together we haven't talked about these
 
04:15:21.630 --> 04:15:21.640 align:start position:0%
issues no direct support has been
 
04:15:24.750 --> 04:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
provided before we start penalizing I
 
04:15:28.630 --> 04:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
think we should Define some steps that
 
04:15:31.990 --> 04:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
we can provide equitable distribution of
 
04:15:34.830 --> 04:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
our funding sources and help the school
 
04:15:38.149 --> 04:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
districts we have public and public
 
04:15:41.030 --> 04:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
schools and public charter schools to do
 
04:15:43.469 --> 04:15:43.479 align:start position:0%
better in their work so I think we have
 
04:15:45.670 --> 04:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of things we can do before all of
 
04:15:48.109 --> 04:15:48.119 align:start position:0%
a sudden saying well anybody that scores
 
04:15:50.309 --> 04:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
in the bottom proficiency now can go to
 
04:15:51.870 --> 04:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
a different School District or we're
 
04:15:54.149 --> 04:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
going to give you an EA to go someplace
 
04:15:58.309 --> 04:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
else I I'm sorry I just I know that this
 
04:16:01.349 --> 04:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
is personal for me because I've been an
 
04:16:03.510 --> 04:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
educator all my life but what I've
 
04:16:06.189 --> 04:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
experienced and watched over the years
 
04:16:07.510 --> 04:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
this just
 
04:16:09.670 --> 04:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
I just can't stand back and not say
 
04:16:11.670 --> 04:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
anything about this because we have an
 
04:16:13.750 --> 04:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
obligation to the students in our state
 
04:16:16.790 --> 04:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
and I don't think this is a solution by
 
04:16:18.950 --> 04:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
simply sending them someplace else thank
 
04:16:21.389 --> 04:16:21.399 align:start position:0%
you very much for listen represent
 
04:16:23.389 --> 04:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
cordelli and then representative beler
 
04:16:27.910 --> 04:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you um uh I would agree with
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
representative lad in that um the test
 
04:16:32.790 --> 04:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
scores um have not gone down just as a
 
04:16:35.630 --> 04:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
results of the pandemic um as a matter
 
04:16:39.630 --> 04:16:39.640 align:start position:0%
of fact uh um New Hampshire I've read is
 
04:16:42.189 --> 04:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
one of the um leading States in terms of
 
04:16:44.229 --> 04:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
learning loss recovery in the
 
04:16:48.149 --> 04:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
nation um in addition in the last budget
 
04:16:51.990 --> 04:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned um school funding was
 
04:16:56.109 --> 04:16:56.119 align:start position:0%
increased by over 160 billion $160
 
04:17:00.670 --> 04:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
million thank you um and
 
04:17:00.680 --> 04:17:02.469 align:start position:0%
million thank you um and
secondly

04:17:02.469 --> 04:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
um um there is the Esser funds the
 
04:17:06.910 --> 04:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
federal funds that have been provided
 
04:17:09.990 --> 04:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
school districts I know just in my local
 
04:17:12.149 --> 04:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
little school district with seven little
 
04:17:15.910 --> 04:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
towns um they still haven't figured out
 
04:17:18.469 --> 04:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
how they're going to spend $6 million in
 
04:17:20.950 --> 04:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
phase three funds that are expiring to
 
04:17:23.389 --> 04:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
the end of September so there is money
 
04:17:26.389 --> 04:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
out there so um I'm I'm sorry there is
 
04:17:29.910 --> 04:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
there has been money um provided um via
 
04:17:32.670 --> 04:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
the budget and via the federal funds uh
 
04:17:35.389 --> 04:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
to recover from learning loss um you
 
04:17:37.990 --> 04:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
know we've had bills to to improve
 
04:17:41.790 --> 04:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
literacy that have not passed um so uh I
 
04:17:44.149 --> 04:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
think we have been doing our share to
 
04:17:47.149 --> 04:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
try and um improve student
 
04:17:51.750 --> 04:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
outcomes PR beler thank you Mr chair um
 
04:17:53.630 --> 04:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
to the point I was brought up earlier as
 
04:17:55.149 --> 04:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
far as chartered schools why they're
 
04:17:56.790 --> 04:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
excluded I think a careful reading of
 
04:17:59.229 --> 04:17:59.239 align:start position:0%
this will find that uh chartered school
 
04:18:01.429 --> 04:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
students are not excluded but the
 
04:18:02.950 --> 04:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
charter schools themselves are simply
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
excluded from the uh calculation for the
 
04:18:05.720 --> 04:18:07.910 align:start position:0%
excluded from the uh calculation for the
aggregate

04:18:07.910 --> 04:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
aggregate
 
04:18:10.189 --> 04:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
um well that I don't have an answer to
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
but just wanted to clarify that um as
 
04:18:15.309 --> 04:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
far as uh the the the intent of this
 
04:18:17.910 --> 04:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
bill to get these uh students the
 
04:18:20.630 --> 04:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to leave a uh school that is
 
04:18:23.550 --> 04:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
performing near the bottom I I I fully
 
04:18:25.229 --> 04:18:25.239 align:start position:0%
agree with the idea of reforming schools
 
04:18:26.590 --> 04:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
so that they're that they're producing
 
04:18:28.790 --> 04:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
better outcomes um I'd like to see
 
04:18:32.189 --> 04:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
schools doing that at the same time I I
 
04:18:34.750 --> 04:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
can't I can't get on board with the idea
 
04:18:37.030 --> 04:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
of leaving any student in the lurch in a
 
04:18:39.349 --> 04:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
in a bottom performing School while the
 
04:18:41.830 --> 04:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
school is working to improve itself I
 
04:18:43.469 --> 04:18:43.479 align:start position:0%
believe we need to be able to walk and
 
04:18:45.070 --> 04:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
chew publicum at the same time on this
 
04:18:47.710 --> 04:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
one thank you represent
 
04:18:51.149 --> 04:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
Mila thank you Mr chairman once again
 
04:18:52.710 --> 04:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
we're faced with
 
04:18:58.910 --> 04:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
a uh a bill that has no fiscal
 
04:19:02.030 --> 04:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
note so we just basically open up the
 
04:19:04.109 --> 04:19:04.119 align:start position:0%
budget y all
 
04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
come and also there are no guidelines to
 
04:19:09.229 --> 04:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear me that say that
 
04:19:11.510 --> 04:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
time and time
 
04:19:14.269 --> 04:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
again we've tried to provide those
 
04:19:17.710 --> 04:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
timelines those who advocate for this
 
04:19:20.349 --> 04:19:20.359 align:start position:0%
totally reject it at some point in time
 
04:19:23.790 --> 04:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
folks this is going to get so
 
04:19:26.950 --> 04:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
big that you're going to wonder who in
 
04:19:29.870 --> 04:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
the hell is running the shop
 
04:19:34.710 --> 04:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
here that alone with this this proposal
 
04:19:37.750 --> 04:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
here whether it's 49% or
 
04:19:39.790 --> 04:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
25% we just don't know what it's going
 
04:19:39.800 --> 04:19:40.670 align:start position:0%
25% we just don't know what it's going
to

04:19:40.670 --> 04:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:19:43.990 --> 04:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
cost and I'm surprised that some of the
 
04:19:46.790 --> 04:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal conservatives in this room are
 
04:19:49.109 --> 04:19:49.119 align:start position:0%
going to allow this to happen when we
 
04:19:53.189 --> 04:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
talk about funding kids to have meals
 
04:19:56.149 --> 04:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
big issue about how what it costs no
 
04:19:57.950 --> 04:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
question about it
 
04:20:01.309 --> 04:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
here I wish it'd be a little
 
04:20:04.429 --> 04:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
consistent uh just to inform you there
 
04:20:11.269 --> 04:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:14.030 --> 04:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
and that's what it says right
 
04:20:16.429 --> 04:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
here but there is a fiscal note and you
 
04:20:17.950 --> 04:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
said there was no fiscal
 
04:20:21.109 --> 04:20:21.119 align:start position:0%
note give me a break will and it does it
 
04:20:23.109 --> 04:20:23.119 align:start position:0%
does State the cost that we're spending
 
04:20:26.469 --> 04:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
per pupil in it so do the
 
04:20:29.389 --> 04:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
multiplication um so but I also want to
 
04:20:32.510 --> 04:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
Echo where uh represent cordelli was
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
that we do have professional development
 
04:20:36.910 --> 04:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
money we've been talk we talked about
 
04:20:39.229 --> 04:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
that title 2 money for many times in
 
04:20:41.990 --> 04:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
here and there's still excess to that in
 
04:20:44.269 --> 04:20:44.279 align:start position:0%
in the department budget right now for
 
04:20:47.950 --> 04:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
the schools yes represent luno thank you
 
04:20:50.830 --> 04:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
very much so um just a couple of points
 
04:20:54.070 --> 04:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make I think um you know the
 
04:20:56.149 --> 04:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
discussion and the um and the the
 
04:20:57.950 --> 04:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
amendment as as presented there's a
 
04:20:59.429 --> 04:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
little bit of a slight of hand being
 
04:21:01.590 --> 04:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
done because it's not saying a student
 
04:21:04.389 --> 04:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
who is a member of the ADM you know
 
04:21:06.510 --> 04:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
going to a school that's in the bottom
 
04:21:08.550 --> 04:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
25% just says lives within the
 
04:21:11.309 --> 04:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
boundaries of such school district and
 
04:21:12.910 --> 04:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
uh we know that Manchester is one of
 
04:21:15.670 --> 04:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
those districts where student outcomes
 
04:21:18.030 --> 04:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
are significantly below State average
 
04:21:19.910 --> 04:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
and that's not because of the kids in
 
04:21:21.710 --> 04:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester it's not because the teachers
 
04:21:23.910 --> 04:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
or the administrators in Manchester it's
 
04:21:25.630 --> 04:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
just because Manchester is underfunded
 
04:21:29.189 --> 04:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
by about $100 million and um and there's
 
04:21:30.670 --> 04:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
certainly a lot of people who live in
 
04:21:33.670 --> 04:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
the Manchester Geographic boundary that
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
attend uh private schools and this would
 
04:21:39.349 --> 04:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
just further promote um uh the use of uh
 
04:21:42.149 --> 04:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
voucher dollars State taxpayer money to
 
04:21:44.510 --> 04:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh to to basically be tuition rebate
 
04:21:47.510 --> 04:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
programs and um and which is which is
 
04:21:49.630 --> 04:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely what we have seen with this
 
04:21:53.109 --> 04:21:53.119 align:start position:0%
um uh with this program but um but you
 
04:21:55.269 --> 04:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
know further I just want to want to
 
04:21:58.790 --> 04:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
comment on um on you know just the just
 
04:22:01.950 --> 04:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
the idea that that um that New Hampshire
 
04:22:05.030 --> 04:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know students are somehow you know
 
04:22:06.790 --> 04:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
performing at a subpar level because
 
04:22:09.550 --> 04:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
they're not so any objective standards
 
04:22:12.349 --> 04:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
and there are lots of them that point to
 
04:22:14.790 --> 04:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
the strong outcomes that we're seeing uh
 
04:22:18.389 --> 04:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
across the state u in terms of in in
 
04:22:22.590 --> 04:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
terms of of student performance um and
 
04:22:25.510 --> 04:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
to to suggest that uh that that this is
 
04:22:28.750 --> 04:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
some sort of relief valve uh for that is
 
04:22:31.550 --> 04:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
um is incorrect because what we don't
 
04:22:35.189 --> 04:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
have any data to point to zero data to
 
04:22:37.790 --> 04:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
point to is how how how student per how
 
04:22:39.550 --> 04:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
students are students with vouchers are
 
04:22:42.750 --> 04:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
performing and there every every every
 
04:22:45.030 --> 04:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
time we have tried to put any sort of
 
04:22:47.429 --> 04:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
assessment or accountability on this it
 
04:22:50.990 --> 04:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
has been summarily rejected uh by it so
 
04:22:53.710 --> 04:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
so I can't see how possibly how possibly
 
04:22:56.910 --> 04:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
even if you even if we did believe that
 
04:22:59.389 --> 04:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
um that this was going to be limited to
 
04:23:01.750 --> 04:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh to students or directed to students
 
04:23:03.990 --> 04:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
with uh with with uh with low
 
04:23:06.550 --> 04:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
performance that they would do any
 
04:23:08.790 --> 04:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
better at all with a voucher because
 
04:23:11.710 --> 04:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
there is zero evidence to suggest that
 
04:23:11.720 --> 04:23:12.990 align:start position:0%
there is zero evidence to suggest that
further

04:23:12.990 --> 04:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:23:16.429 --> 04:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
discussion repres
 
04:23:20.109 --> 04:23:20.119 align:start position:0%
leus now that this is devolved into a
 
04:23:24.510 --> 04:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
funding argument I do want to
 
04:23:24.520 --> 04:23:27.590 align:start position:0%
funding argument I do want to
mention

04:23:27.590 --> 04:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.670 --> 04:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
that in the 1990s I
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
believe um when
 
04:23:38.670 --> 04:23:38.680 align:start position:0%
the court system across the country
 
04:23:38.680 --> 04:23:40.149 align:start position:0%
the court system across the country
started

04:23:40.149 --> 04:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
started
 
04:23:44.349 --> 04:23:44.359 align:start position:0%
pushing heavily
 
04:23:46.550 --> 04:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
for um
 
04:23:46.560 --> 04:23:48.630 align:start position:0%
for um
Equity

04:23:48.630 --> 04:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
Equity
 
04:23:52.229 --> 04:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
Etc they started demanding that states
 
04:23:54.550 --> 04:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
provide more and more and more money
 
04:23:56.590 --> 04:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
particularly in school districts which
 
04:23:58.469 --> 04:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
were not performing as well as other
 
04:24:01.510 --> 04:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
school districts and I believe it was
 
04:24:03.950 --> 04:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
Kansas City but I'm not
 
04:24:07.550 --> 04:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
positive they kept increasing and
 
04:24:10.630 --> 04:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
increasing the amount of money until the
 
04:24:14.590 --> 04:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
whole state was being money was being
 
04:24:16.630 --> 04:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
collected to give to this one school
 
04:24:20.630 --> 04:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
district that kept not improving their
 
04:24:22.910 --> 04:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
results and they got to where they had
 
04:24:25.910 --> 04:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
so much money they were trying to figure
 
04:24:28.469 --> 04:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
out how to spend it they had done all
 
04:24:31.349 --> 04:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
the standard small class sizes after
 
04:24:33.469 --> 04:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
school hours Etc everything they could
 
04:24:35.189 --> 04:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
think of everything that had been
 
04:24:37.870 --> 04:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
published this the outcomes still were
 
04:24:40.790 --> 04:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
not improving they had swimming pools
 
04:24:42.630 --> 04:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
and tennis courts and whatever because
 
04:24:44.269 --> 04:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
they'd already done all the things that
 
04:24:45.590 --> 04:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
everybody had
 
04:24:50.109 --> 04:24:50.119 align:start position:0%
suggested and ultimately the program was
 
04:24:52.870 --> 04:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
discontinued the outcomes had actually
 
04:24:57.469 --> 04:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
started to decline and not get better so
 
04:25:00.790 --> 04:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
as long as we're saying just give more
 
04:25:02.950 --> 04:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
money just give more money and the
 
04:25:04.429 --> 04:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
schools will be better just give more
 
04:25:06.149 --> 04:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
money and the schools would be better
 
04:25:07.990 --> 04:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
obviously we need to be doing something
 
04:25:09.990 --> 04:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
different than just giving more money
 
04:25:12.189 --> 04:25:12.199 align:start position:0%
because we've tried that all across the
 
04:25:14.189 --> 04:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
country that was one of the most
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
egregious examples but we have tried it
 
04:25:18.670 --> 04:25:18.680 align:start position:0%
all across the country and just give
 
04:25:22.030 --> 04:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
more money does not improve results we
 
04:25:26.030 --> 04:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
have to do things differently and if you
 
04:25:28.710 --> 04:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
took a scatter plot I mean if you took a
 
04:25:31.070 --> 04:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
plot of the amount of money spent per
 
04:25:33.710 --> 04:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
school district and the outcomes in the
 
04:25:35.870 --> 04:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
school district it looks like a scatter
 
04:25:37.870 --> 04:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
plan it looks like somebody threw sand
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
on it because there is no correlation
 
04:25:45.269 --> 04:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
between money spent and outcomes okay
 
04:25:48.750 --> 04:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
um we ought to be conscious of of our
 
04:25:51.189 --> 04:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
time that we have here because we're
 
04:25:52.990 --> 04:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
going to get this stuff done today and I
 
04:25:54.750 --> 04:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to be here till
 
04:25:58.950 --> 04:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
55:30 represent Tanner I just I have to
 
04:26:00.990 --> 04:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh disagree with the last statement that
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative lake has made because
 
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the commission on school funding
 
04:26:08.389 --> 04:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
there several charts that will point to
 
04:26:10.790 --> 04:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
that fact and the other thing is that I
 
04:26:12.590 --> 04:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
believe Kansas was a state that had to
 
04:26:14.630 --> 04:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
close their schools in like March or
 
04:26:15.950 --> 04:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
April because they didn't have enough
 
04:26:17.269 --> 04:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
school funding to make it through the
 
04:26:20.149 --> 04:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:24.349 --> 04:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
year one short comment Mr chair and my
 
04:26:27.229 --> 04:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
request is that the Department of
 
04:26:30.429 --> 04:26:30.439 align:start position:0%
Education come up with a plan to lead
 
04:26:32.309 --> 04:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
the learning across the state of New
 
04:26:35.269 --> 04:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the purpose of increasing
 
04:26:36.830 --> 04:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
assessment School
 
04:26:38.670 --> 04:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
after that happens then I would
 
04:26:40.389 --> 04:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
entertain something like well probably
 
04:26:44.269 --> 04:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
not but if we want to be honest but do
 
04:26:47.070 --> 04:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
not lie we have not seen anybody from
 
04:26:49.910 --> 04:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
the state level leading the learning in
 
04:26:51.550 --> 04:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
our local school districts thank you
 
04:26:55.429 --> 04:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
very much I gson Woodcock thank you I'm
 
04:26:57.309 --> 04:26:57.319 align:start position:0%
not going to stop top of the fing but I
 
04:27:01.349 --> 04:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
I will talk about I the I find insulting
 
04:27:03.750 --> 04:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
cand uh and I couldn't find any other
 
04:27:06.070 --> 04:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation when I look inside
 
04:27:08.149 --> 04:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
under the short title and it says
 
04:27:10.550 --> 04:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
reforming negligent
 
04:27:12.670 --> 04:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
schools I find that insulting to our
 
04:27:14.790 --> 04:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
teachers to our administrators to our
 
04:27:16.070 --> 04:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
parents everyone working in these
 
04:27:17.429 --> 04:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
schools trying to improve student
 
04:27:19.389 --> 04:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
achievement and I look at the sponsors
 
04:27:21.149 --> 04:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
of the bill and I'm not
 
04:27:23.670 --> 04:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
surprised I I want you to be very
 
04:27:25.389 --> 04:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
careful when you're pointing arrows

during the uh during the hearing um this
 
04:41:25.830 --> 04:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
is something that uh has been in works
 
04:41:30.150 --> 04:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
for the past year um it was tabled last
 
04:41:30.160 --> 04:41:31.910 align:start position:0%
for the past year um it was tabled last
year

04:41:31.910 --> 04:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:41:37.948 --> 04:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
um the important things are that we um
 
04:41:41.510 --> 04:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
removed K12 education from the
 
04:41:45.350 --> 04:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
exemption uh under criminal statutes uh
 
04:41:47.590 --> 04:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
for uh obscene
 
04:41:51.390 --> 04:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
materials um and um it is not expected
 
04:41:53.030 --> 04:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
that there
 
04:41:56.310 --> 04:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
will in any foreseeable future be any
 
04:42:01.670 --> 04:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
criminal um uh charges along those lines
 
04:42:05.190 --> 04:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
um there is a process a minimum process
 
04:42:12.910 --> 04:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
laid out um for uh parents to appeal um
 
04:42:15.670 --> 04:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh in reference to materials that they
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
think are uh inappropriate um in the
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
school um and thirdly um
 
04:42:29.510 --> 04:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
if um if the
 
04:42:32.990 --> 04:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
district uh does say that or the state
 
04:42:35.190 --> 04:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
board says that materials should be
 
04:42:37.590 --> 04:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
moved um or not made available to
 
04:42:39.350 --> 04:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
certain age groups and the school does
 
04:42:44.230 --> 04:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
not do it then there is a um complaint
 
04:42:47.070 --> 04:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
civil complaint process that is uh
 
04:42:50.270 --> 04:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
included in the bill um and all of this
 
04:42:53.868 --> 04:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
has been worked on um with the attorney
 
04:42:58.628 --> 04:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
general um definitions and
 
04:43:01.190 --> 04:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
um definition of what's harmful to
 
04:43:05.230 --> 04:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
minors um was all taken from uh um
 
04:43:10.510 --> 04:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court cases um primarily uh
 
04:43:13.350 --> 04:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
Ginsburg ver New York versus
 
04:43:17.948 --> 04:43:17.958 align:start position:0%
Ginsburg and um I think that it's uh
 
04:43:22.830 --> 04:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
really in um hopefully there are not
 
04:43:27.430 --> 04:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
many um instances where um parents will
 
04:43:31.110 --> 04:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
have to go to um the schools to complain
 
04:43:33.150 --> 04:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
about materials I know it has happened
 
04:43:35.510 --> 04:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
in um a number number of communities in
 
04:43:37.868 --> 04:43:37.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I think there has to
 
04:43:41.310 --> 04:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
be uh remedies available to uh to all
 
04:43:45.750 --> 04:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
parents um when this situation
 
04:43:47.990 --> 04:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
occurs represent Noble do you have
 
04:43:49.310 --> 04:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
anything to add to
 
04:43:52.550 --> 04:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
this um I just a little bit I I agree
 
04:43:54.270 --> 04:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
with everything representative cordelli
 
04:43:57.270 --> 04:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
said um I think the appeal process is
 
04:43:59.628 --> 04:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
really important for
 
04:44:02.910 --> 04:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
parents um there's
 
04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
been a lot of books brought up over the
 
04:44:08.070 --> 04:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
last couple years and each time I see a
 
04:44:10.990 --> 04:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
new one it is more disturbing than the
 
04:44:13.310 --> 04:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
previous one I've
 
04:44:16.070 --> 04:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
seen most of which I couldn't even read
 
04:44:18.350 --> 04:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
here because it puts the New Hampshire

04:45:41.070 --> 04:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
be discouraging for miners in our Public

04:45:48.590 --> 04:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
promotes naked selfies if you're lucky

appropriate for Miners and I have yet to
 
04:46:20.350 --> 04:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
find the limit of what
 
04:46:23.230 --> 04:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
people will be
 
04:46:26.390 --> 04:46:26.400 align:start position:0%

04:46:30.788 --> 04:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
something up it gets shut down and I'm a

Tanner thank you I think we heard just
 
04:46:54.590 --> 04:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
this past week a very
 
04:46:57.628 --> 04:46:57.638 align:start position:0%
thoughtful well researched
 
04:47:00.910 --> 04:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
bill that speaks to Community
 
04:47:05.510 --> 04:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
Values in how to actually go through a
 
04:47:08.390 --> 04:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
process that brings the community
 
04:47:12.708 --> 04:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
together in a reasonable way to
 
04:47:16.070 --> 04:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
address materials that parents feel are
 
04:47:19.510 --> 04:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
unwelcomed in in the school library this
 
04:47:20.868 --> 04:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
bill on the other
 
04:47:24.430 --> 04:47:24.440 align:start position:0%

um removes the
 
04:47:33.548 --> 04:47:33.558 align:start position:0%
obscenity restrictions from this the
 
04:47:35.670 --> 04:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
criminal law law because the criminal
 
04:47:38.190 --> 04:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
law talks about Community
 
04:47:40.910 --> 04:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
standards we know that there are groups
 
04:47:42.910 --> 04:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
in culture wars throughout the United
 
04:47:45.230 --> 04:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
States and in New Hampshire that will
 
04:47:49.230 --> 04:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
bring in a folder to a school of a
 
04:47:51.390 --> 04:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
number of books tens of books that they
 
04:47:53.670 --> 04:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
want banned out of the library they
 
04:47:55.310 --> 04:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
haven't even read them they don't know
 
04:47:58.910 --> 04:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
the context of them um it puts the
 
04:48:00.110 --> 04:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
school in a
 
04:48:02.190 --> 04:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
process that they have to remove the
 
04:48:06.190 --> 04:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
books and then uh go through a whole
 
04:48:08.750 --> 04:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
process that's that's usually very
 
04:48:10.470 --> 04:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
contentious and doesn't speak to
 
04:48:12.948 --> 04:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
Community Values and what the schools
 
04:48:16.190 --> 04:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
are actually trying to do um libraries I
 
04:48:18.670 --> 04:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
think uh we've heard are the windows to
 
04:48:21.470 --> 04:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
the world it's the way kids can explore
 
04:48:23.150 --> 04:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
the world learn new
 
04:48:26.030 --> 04:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
experiences um I went to
 
04:48:29.230 --> 04:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
um a talk the a couple months ago by
 
04:48:33.150 --> 04:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
Jody Pico she's the most banned book
 
04:48:33.160 --> 04:48:34.510 align:start position:0%
Jody Pico she's the most banned book
author

04:48:34.510 --> 04:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
author
 
04:48:36.948 --> 04:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
in the United States and I don't know if
 
04:48:39.390 --> 04:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
anybody else here reads Jody Pico but I
 
04:48:42.868 --> 04:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
do I've read her for a long long time
 
04:48:46.470 --> 04:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
she has the problem is for her is that
 
04:48:49.628 --> 04:48:49.638 align:start position:0%
she tries to approach very controversial
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
issues but as she approaches those
 
04:48:55.070 --> 04:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
issues through her characters she tells
 
04:48:57.990 --> 04:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
the story from many many sides of the
 
04:49:01.110 --> 04:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
story when I was in school people tried
 
04:49:05.150 --> 04:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
to ban um One Flew Over no uh tequilla
 
04:49:08.310 --> 04:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
mocking bber and it was one of my
 
04:49:11.628 --> 04:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
favorite books and um you know when you
 
04:49:15.868 --> 04:49:15.878 align:start position:0%
start getting picky about little things
 
04:49:17.750 --> 04:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know you can you can just set
 
04:49:21.510 --> 04:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
everything into total chaos um we're not
 
04:49:24.510 --> 04:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
a country that bans books we're not a
 
04:49:27.628 --> 04:49:27.638 align:start position:0%
state that bans books um but we are a
 
04:49:31.150 --> 04:49:31.160 align:start position:0%
state that uses reasonable processes to
 
04:49:34.190 --> 04:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
involve parents in the school um and as
 
04:49:35.990 --> 04:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
I said I think the the bill that we
 
04:49:39.510 --> 04:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
heard this past week meets those needs
 
04:49:41.788 --> 04:49:41.798 align:start position:0%
and we don't need this
 
04:49:46.948 --> 04:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
bill further discussion represent
 
04:49:52.390 --> 04:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
leus I'm still trying to figure out
 
04:49:56.270 --> 04:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
how the book that she was referring to
 
04:49:58.990 --> 04:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
meets Community standards
 
04:50:02.548 --> 04:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
when it was just a few years ago schools
 
04:50:05.788 --> 04:50:05.798 align:start position:0%
were spending a lot of time explaining
 
04:50:09.310 --> 04:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
why students shouldn't be sending nudies
 
04:50:12.110 --> 04:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
over the internet to their boyfriends or
 
04:50:16.470 --> 04:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
girlfriends why you know um I have I
 
04:50:20.390 --> 04:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
know numerous couples who have been
 
04:50:25.030 --> 04:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
working for the last 20 30 or more years
 
04:50:28.990 --> 04:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with the problems that come from
 
04:50:31.510 --> 04:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
addiction to porn and the effect that
 
04:50:35.750 --> 04:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's having on married couples
 
04:50:37.948 --> 04:50:37.958 align:start position:0%
and I
 
04:50:41.708 --> 04:50:41.718 align:start position:0%
just I guess I just don't get how our
 
04:50:44.750 --> 04:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
community has come to the point where in
 
04:50:46.788 --> 04:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
this short period of time we've gone
 
04:50:50.270 --> 04:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
from not sharing nudies to oh here's how
 
04:50:52.670 --> 04:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
you do it and it's a really good thing
 
04:50:55.310 --> 04:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
and not becoming addicted to porn and
 
04:50:58.708 --> 04:50:58.718 align:start position:0%
all the reasons why not to to oh this is
 
04:51:00.788 --> 04:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
this is the best porn that you can watch
 
04:51:01.830 --> 04:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
let's do
 
04:51:05.548 --> 04:51:05.558 align:start position:0%
this how did we get here and why is this
 
04:51:09.070 --> 04:51:09.080 align:start position:0%
acceptable and in our
 
04:51:11.708 --> 04:51:11.718 align:start position:0%
schools through the discussion represent
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
B bony uh thank you um I just want to
 
04:51:17.990 --> 04:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about personal story
 
04:51:20.230 --> 04:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh one of the books is on the one of the
 
04:51:23.150 --> 04:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
Bands is a book that I presented to my
 
04:51:25.110 --> 04:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
own kids it's called It's Perfectly
 
04:51:27.910 --> 04:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
Normal it's a book that talks about sex
 
04:51:31.070 --> 04:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
education for elementary children and I
 
04:51:32.910 --> 04:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
for the life of me it's perfectly
 
04:51:36.670 --> 04:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
acceptable for for me to give that to my
 
04:51:39.430 --> 04:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
children and that's my choice it's if
 
04:51:41.830 --> 04:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's available in a library book and you
 
04:51:43.910 --> 04:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to take it out for your kids
 
04:51:47.310 --> 04:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
that's fine um but I don't think that we
 
04:51:49.868 --> 04:51:49.878 align:start position:0%
should be in the business of dictating
 
04:51:52.350 --> 04:51:52.360 align:start position:0%
what our school districts do there are
 
04:51:55.430 --> 04:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
policies in place and if those districts
 
04:51:57.830 --> 04:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
don't have policies there's another bill
 
04:52:00.150 --> 04:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
that's coming through that mandates that
 
04:52:03.230 --> 04:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
schools establish those policies and I
 
04:52:05.910 --> 04:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
think that if we go down and try to
 
04:52:08.628 --> 04:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
Define prevailing standards and use
 
04:52:09.868 --> 04:52:09.878 align:start position:0%
other vague
 
04:52:12.910 --> 04:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
definitions um it's it's not fair it's
 
04:52:15.990 --> 04:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
just not fair to the other people that
 
04:52:17.910 --> 04:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
might think that it's okay and there
 
04:52:20.868 --> 04:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
might be a specific reason why that book
 
04:52:22.788 --> 04:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
is important to that child and we
 
04:52:24.548 --> 04:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
certainly shouldn't be cherry-picking
 
04:52:26.830 --> 04:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
phrases out of books without looking at
 
04:52:30.548 --> 04:52:30.558 align:start position:0%
them in their entirety and that is up to
 
04:52:33.230 --> 04:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
our professionals and our schools to do
 
04:52:35.470 --> 04:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
that and there are processes in place
 
04:52:37.510 --> 04:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
but the final decision should rest
 
04:52:40.110 --> 04:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
within our school
 
04:52:44.110 --> 04:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:47.430 --> 04:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
Noble what I just read to you is not
 
04:52:51.990 --> 04:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
cherry-picking and this defense of this
 
04:52:55.510 --> 04:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
sexually explicit material is such a
 
04:53:02.548 --> 04:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:02.558 --> 04:53:08.110 align:start position:0%
 
schools

04:53:08.110 --> 04:53:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:08.120 --> 04:53:09.910 align:start position:0%
 
thank

04:53:09.910 --> 04:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:53:13.350 --> 04:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
you representative Celli uh thank you a
 
04:53:17.750 --> 04:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
couple of things um uh I agree that um
 
04:53:20.150 --> 04:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
libraries can be a window to the
 
04:53:20.160 --> 04:53:21.868 align:start position:0%
libraries can be a window to the
world

04:53:21.868 --> 04:53:21.878 align:start position:0%
world
 
04:53:25.830 --> 04:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
um but the world isn't always a safe
 
04:53:29.470 --> 04:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
place there is evil in the world also um
 
04:53:32.110 --> 04:53:32.120 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't say that the internet
 
04:53:34.110 --> 04:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
um is uh
 
04:53:37.948 --> 04:53:37.958 align:start position:0%
a safe place all the time for minors um
 
04:53:41.628 --> 04:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
and in terms of um we heard in the
 
04:53:44.350 --> 04:53:44.360 align:start position:0%
hearing and again today about Community
 
04:53:48.910 --> 04:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
standard um let me just go back to that
 
04:53:52.590 --> 04:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
because the original case with obscenity
 
04:53:54.708 --> 04:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
was Miller versus
 
04:53:59.628 --> 04:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
California and in that case um Mr Miller
 
04:54:02.750 --> 04:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
wanted obscenity defined on a national
 
04:54:02.760 --> 04:54:05.230 align:start position:0%
wanted obscenity defined on a national
basis

04:54:05.230 --> 04:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
basis
 
04:54:07.990 --> 04:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
the and let me quote the trial court
 
04:54:10.070 --> 04:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
instructed the jury to evaluate the
 
04:54:12.990 --> 04:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
materials by contemporary Community
 
04:54:15.270 --> 04:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
standards of
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
California it was a State Community
 
04:54:22.070 --> 04:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
standard that they Court ruled on or
 
04:54:25.470 --> 04:54:25.480 align:start position:0%
ruled for not as opposed to a National
 
04:54:27.230 --> 04:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
Standard so that's that's what we're
 
04:54:31.868 --> 04:54:31.878 align:start position:0%
talking about um and uh we're not just
 
04:54:33.868 --> 04:54:33.878 align:start position:0%
talking about pornography you know I've
 
04:54:35.470 --> 04:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
seen materials I've got one here that
 
04:54:38.150 --> 04:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
someone gave me pictures of of kids
 
04:54:38.160 --> 04:54:40.310 align:start position:0%
someone gave me pictures of of kids
cutting

04:54:40.310 --> 04:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
cutting
 
04:54:42.470 --> 04:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
themselves you know so it's just not
 
04:54:46.548 --> 04:54:46.558 align:start position:0%
pornography there's other um dangerous I
 
04:54:49.670 --> 04:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
think materials uh being made available
 
04:54:52.230 --> 04:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
um in some libraries in some school
 
04:54:55.150 --> 04:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
libraries um we've talked about suicide
 
04:54:56.750 --> 04:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
how many times have we talked about
 
04:54:59.230 --> 04:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
child suicide and mental health what are
 
04:55:01.190 --> 04:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
we doing if we're presenting materials
 
04:55:05.110 --> 04:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
to them with um information and stories
 
04:55:06.910 --> 04:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
about kids cutting themselves and
 
04:55:09.070 --> 04:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
committing suicide are we helping a
 
04:55:12.548 --> 04:55:12.558 align:start position:0%
child in that regard I don't think
 
04:55:16.310 --> 04:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
so represent McDonald thank you Mr chair
 
04:55:18.628 --> 04:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
moments ago the concept of local control
 
04:55:20.510 --> 04:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
was brought up and I'd like to focus on
 
04:55:21.628 --> 04:55:21.638 align:start position:0%
that for a
 
04:55:25.430 --> 04:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
bit I was approached on about this bill
 
04:55:29.190 --> 04:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
by a constituent who is a single father
 
04:55:31.350 --> 04:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
of two School AG childrens within our
 
04:55:34.708 --> 04:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
school district and our school district
 
04:55:36.310 --> 04:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
does have these policies in place like
 
04:55:39.190 --> 04:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
many across the state and a concerned
 
04:55:41.030 --> 04:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
parent approached the school board about
 
04:55:42.390 --> 04:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
a particular
 
04:55:46.110 --> 04:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
book and the school district was not
 
04:55:48.430 --> 04:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
able to help in that case despite having
 
04:55:51.548 --> 04:55:51.558 align:start position:0%
these policies on the books and in this
 
04:55:54.150 --> 04:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
particular incident would have benefited
 
04:55:56.190 --> 04:55:56.200 align:start position:0%
from a directive from the state I have
 
04:55:57.910 --> 04:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
shared with you his testimony both in
 
04:55:59.990 --> 04:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
paper and he shared it with all of you
 
04:56:01.750 --> 04:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
via email I'd encourage you to take a
 
04:56:04.628 --> 04:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
look at it his name is Kevin gag
 
04:56:07.310 --> 04:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
and on that instance we love our public
 
04:56:11.430 --> 04:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
schools and this isn't any way to be
 
04:56:13.430 --> 04:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
condescending towards them or anything
 
04:56:16.110 --> 04:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
negative just even schools with these
 
04:56:17.990 --> 04:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
policies in place could benefit from the
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
directive from the state and that's all
 
04:56:21.310 --> 04:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
I really have to say thank you thank you
 
04:56:23.270 --> 04:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
very much representative petno then
 
04:56:23.280 --> 04:56:25.070 align:start position:0%
very much representative petno then
representative

04:56:25.070 --> 04:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:56:27.548 --> 04:56:27.558 align:start position:0%
cascaden I'm just curious if anybody
 
04:56:30.948 --> 04:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
could point to the specific section of
 
04:56:33.030 --> 04:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
the test that or this section of the
 
04:56:33.040 --> 04:56:34.030 align:start position:0%
the test that or this section of the
test

04:56:34.030 --> 04:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
test
 
04:56:36.590 --> 04:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
I feel like I'm taking a test um the
 
04:56:40.230 --> 04:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
section of this bill that
 
04:56:43.310 --> 04:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
um states that books are actually being
 
04:56:49.030 --> 04:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:51.670 --> 04:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
legislation well um thank you I actually
 
04:56:53.510 --> 04:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
can't answer her question directly
 
04:56:54.430 --> 04:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
because I don't think it's in there
 
04:56:56.708 --> 04:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
because this is not a bill about book
 
04:56:59.350 --> 04:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
Banning book Banning is being
 
04:57:02.590 --> 04:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
misunderstood um by the definition of
 
04:57:04.910 --> 04:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
how some people think about book Manning
 
04:57:07.030 --> 04:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
the um you know any Library can only
 
04:57:08.830 --> 04:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
hold a finite number of books there are
 
04:57:10.990 --> 04:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
selection processes but it comes to the
 
04:57:13.270 --> 04:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
point where you know the only library
 
04:57:15.270 --> 04:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
that possibly wouldn't be accused of
 
04:57:16.310 --> 04:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
book Banning would have to have every
 
04:57:18.548 --> 04:57:18.558 align:start position:0%
single book ever published book Banning
 
04:57:20.430 --> 04:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
as I in the hearing you know people kept
 
04:57:21.708 --> 04:57:21.718 align:start position:0%
saying book Banning book Banning book
 
04:57:23.230 --> 04:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
Banning which is kind of a trigger term
 
04:57:26.670 --> 04:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
for me um because it's so misunderstood
 
04:57:29.590 --> 04:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
it means nobody can can access that book
 
04:57:31.310 --> 04:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere you go to jail if you read it
 
04:57:33.628 --> 04:57:33.638 align:start position:0%
it isn't published that's book Banning
 
04:57:36.390 --> 04:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
this is just selecting materials and
 
04:57:39.150 --> 04:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
this bill gives clear guidelines as to
 
04:57:41.948 --> 04:57:41.958 align:start position:0%
what materials would you know certainly
 
04:57:43.750 --> 04:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
what representative Noble read would
 
04:57:45.750 --> 04:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria of the Miller test and
 
04:57:48.230 --> 04:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
those three criteria so now this bill is
 
04:57:51.230 --> 04:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
not at all about book Banning represent
 
04:57:53.948 --> 04:57:53.958 align:start position:0%
cascaden thank you Mr chair I just uh
 
04:57:57.670 --> 04:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
could you explain to me why RSA 571 in
 
04:58:00.270 --> 04:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
the criminal codes right exposing miners
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
to harmful materials and then opse
 
04:58:05.830 --> 04:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
matter is 650 colon
 
04:58:09.708 --> 04:58:09.718 align:start position:0%
2 if those laws are on the
 
04:58:14.350 --> 04:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:17.708 --> 04:58:17.718 align:start position:0%
filed um oh why isn't this why do we
 
04:58:20.110 --> 04:58:20.120 align:start position:0%
need this policy if it's against the law
 
04:58:24.510 --> 04:58:24.520 align:start position:0%
according to these criminal codes
 
04:58:28.110 --> 04:58:28.120 align:start position:0%
can who's got can you explain that
 
04:58:31.628 --> 04:58:31.638 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli well in terms of 650
 
04:58:33.750 --> 04:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
um that's the criminal code
 
04:58:36.190 --> 04:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
and education right now is
 
04:58:39.510 --> 04:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
exempt education period is exempt from
 
04:58:41.788 --> 04:58:41.798 align:start position:0%
the obscenity
 
04:58:47.548 --> 04:58:47.558 align:start position:0%
statutes this bill changed it so that um
 
04:58:51.350 --> 04:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh K12 is no longer exempt but higher
 
04:58:54.110 --> 04:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
education remains exempt from the OB
 
04:58:55.948 --> 04:58:55.958 align:start position:0%
obscenity statutes because for the most
 
04:58:57.910 --> 04:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
part we're talking about
 
04:59:00.390 --> 04:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
adults represent
 
04:59:04.150 --> 04:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
Tanner just that um if a book is banned
 
04:59:07.070 --> 04:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
if a book is taken out of a library that
 
04:59:09.270 --> 04:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
I use if it's taken out of a school
 
04:59:12.430 --> 04:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
library where my kid is a student and I
 
04:59:14.430 --> 04:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
don't have access to that
 
04:59:17.670 --> 04:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
book that book is banned and this is all
 
04:59:20.110 --> 04:59:20.120 align:start position:0%
about banning books is about going
 
04:59:21.910 --> 04:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
through and seeing books that you don't
 
04:59:25.150 --> 04:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
like or that that you don't think is
 
04:59:27.708 --> 04:59:27.718 align:start position:0%
appropriate for other people just like
 
04:59:30.788 --> 04:59:30.798 align:start position:0%
uh representative balbon said why should
 
04:59:33.910 --> 04:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
you be able to ban books from somebody
 
04:59:35.548 --> 04:59:35.558 align:start position:0%
else in the
 
04:59:38.670 --> 04:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
community that's that unless you have a
 
04:59:38.680 --> 04:59:41.110 align:start position:0%
community that's that unless you have a
community

04:59:41.110 --> 04:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:59:44.470 --> 04:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
consensus representative bone um yes I
 
04:59:47.230 --> 04:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
was just going to point out um to
 
04:59:49.070 --> 04:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner's point and
 
04:59:50.670 --> 04:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
representative peternell asked where
 
04:59:53.390 --> 04:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
does it say baned it does actually on
 
04:59:56.788 --> 04:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
this on page three uh talks about
 
04:59:59.628 --> 04:59:59.638 align:start position:0%
materials being removed or restriction
 
05:00:03.788 --> 05:00:03.798 align:start position:0%
restricted and that that's a ban
 
05:00:08.750 --> 05:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
I want to just inform everybody that um
 
05:00:12.070 --> 05:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
just let my wife's a librarian and they
 
05:00:15.230 --> 05:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
have in this day in library loan so just
 
05:00:17.590 --> 05:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
because a book is not available at one
 
05:00:19.350 --> 05:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
place doesn't mean you're Bann from
 
05:00:21.190 --> 05:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
using that book you can request from
 
05:00:23.948 --> 05:00:23.958 align:start position:0%
your librarian to have that book maybe
 
05:00:25.788 --> 05:00:25.798 align:start position:0%
brought up from another Library
 
05:00:27.670 --> 05:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the
 
05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
state represent Bon you're talking about
 
05:00:33.990 --> 05:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
children's libraries and you're you're
 
05:00:35.948 --> 05:00:35.958 align:start position:0%
have a pretty high expectation that
 
05:00:37.830 --> 05:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
those children are going to know that
 
05:00:39.750 --> 05:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to access or request an
 
05:00:42.628 --> 05:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
into Library librarian in a public
 
05:00:45.910 --> 05:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
school library in fact in Pont the
 
05:00:48.030 --> 05:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
public library is across the street from
 
05:00:49.990 --> 05:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
the school and the school kids come
 
05:00:53.670 --> 05:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
across she's a certified teacher and if
 
05:00:55.230 --> 05:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
there's a book that they're looking at
 
05:00:56.708 --> 05:00:56.718 align:start position:0%
then it's gone done through inner
 
05:00:58.628 --> 05:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
Library loan and adults come in there

information that uh represent cordelli
 
05:01:27.788 --> 05:01:27.798 align:start position:0%
when he was talking about the Miller
 
05:01:30.190 --> 05:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
case Supreme Court ruling that was
 
05:01:34.030 --> 05:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
decades upon decades upon decades ago
 
05:01:36.270 --> 05:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
on Community Values Community standards
 
05:01:37.510 --> 05:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not not questioning what you're
 
05:01:39.430 --> 05:01:39.440 align:start position:0%

05:01:41.708 --> 05:01:41.718 align:start position:0%

you represent Damon thank you Mr
 
05:01:52.150 --> 05:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
chair I want to note that it is not only
 
05:01:55.430 --> 05:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
books that would be limited if this bill
 
05:01:56.948 --> 05:01:56.958 align:start position:0%
were to
 
05:01:59.548 --> 05:01:59.558 align:start position:0%
pass and I would ask people to think
 
05:02:01.590 --> 05:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
about the impact of this on health
 
05:02:04.830 --> 05:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
education and on art
 
05:02:07.750 --> 05:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
education for an example I would
 
05:02:10.110 --> 05:02:10.120 align:start position:0%
particularly think some folks might be
 
05:02:14.070 --> 05:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
aware of a famous old painting if I'm
 
05:02:15.868 --> 05:02:15.878 align:start position:0%
correct it's from the mid
 
05:02:18.788 --> 05:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
1600s it's called The Three
 
05:02:22.750 --> 05:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
Graces it depicts three nude women
 
05:02:22.760 --> 05:02:23.948 align:start position:0%
Graces it depicts three nude women
standing

05:02:23.948 --> 05:02:23.958 align:start position:0%
standing
 
05:02:27.788 --> 05:02:27.798 align:start position:0%
outside two with their back to the
 
05:02:30.430 --> 05:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
Observer one face
 
05:02:34.030 --> 05:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
forward it is one of the most famous
 
05:02:36.628 --> 05:02:36.638 align:start position:0%
paintings in art history and it was used
 
05:02:36.638 --> 05:02:37.590 align:start position:0%
paintings in art history and it was used
is

05:02:37.590 --> 05:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:02:42.270 --> 05:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
used to show that different sized bodies
 
05:02:44.470 --> 05:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
were respected and appreciated in other
 
05:02:46.470 --> 05:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
times these are Buxom women is how I
 
05:02:48.510 --> 05:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
would describe
 
05:02:50.830 --> 05:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
them I can't imagine that we want to
 
05:02:54.750 --> 05:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
create a world where our students cannot
 
05:02:58.310 --> 05:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
access art that shows all different
 
05:02:59.708 --> 05:02:59.718 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
05:03:03.070 --> 05:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
bodies and respects that it's beautiful
 
05:03:04.510 --> 05:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
05:03:07.708 --> 05:03:07.718 align:start position:0%
porn but as I read this bill and think
 
05:03:10.708 --> 05:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
about that art and many other pieces of
 
05:03:13.270 --> 05:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
that era in art I don't think we could
 
05:03:14.788 --> 05:03:14.798 align:start position:0%
introduce our students to them and I
 
05:03:18.430 --> 05:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
think that's wrong number three okay
 
05:03:21.548 --> 05:03:21.558 align:start position:0%
okay before I take any more for we we
 
05:03:25.470 --> 05:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
have some Amendment also for this
 
05:03:29.230 --> 05:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
um um yeah yeah I I'm
 
05:03:31.350 --> 05:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
just I'm getting a hint where this
 
05:03:34.948 --> 05:03:34.958 align:start position:0%
thing's going so um represent leus and
 
05:03:38.868 --> 05:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
then we're going to try to move on
 
05:03:43.628 --> 05:03:43.638 align:start position:0%
here with regard to to what you said I I
 
05:03:47.310 --> 05:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
um having studied plenty of Art and art
 
05:03:50.470 --> 05:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
history and done my history through ART
 
05:03:53.030 --> 05:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
um I do want to point out that in the
 
05:03:54.868 --> 05:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
bill for the purposes of this
 
05:03:56.708 --> 05:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
subdivision material is harmful to
 
05:04:00.830 --> 05:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
minors when the material lacks serious
 
05:04:05.310 --> 05:04:05.320 align:start position:0%
literary scientific medical artistic or
 
05:04:09.230 --> 05:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
political value so those things would
 
05:04:13.270 --> 05:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
not fall under this because they do not
 
05:04:19.270 --> 05:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
lack artistic or medical Etc subject to
 
05:04:21.070 --> 05:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation okay are there any
 
05:04:23.788 --> 05:04:23.798 align:start position:0%
amendments in this just one you
 
05:04:25.510 --> 05:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
introduced it yet no why don't you go
 
05:04:28.430 --> 05:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
ahead and do that uh thank you uh Mr
 
05:04:30.590 --> 05:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
chairman I I think maybe we can get to
 
05:04:33.510 --> 05:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment at this point um it is and
 
05:04:35.910 --> 05:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to offer uh ought to pass on
 
05:04:35.920 --> 05:04:37.310 align:start position:0%
I'd like to offer uh ought to pass on
Amendment

05:04:37.310 --> 05:04:37.320 align:start position:0%

05:04:40.948 --> 05:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
0391 H which I hope everybody has at
 
05:04:40.958 --> 05:04:42.430 align:start position:0%
0391 H which I hope everybody has at
this

05:04:42.430 --> 05:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:04:45.230 --> 05:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
point so you're putting that forward is
 
05:04:47.750 --> 05:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
there a second all second represent
 
05:04:49.910 --> 05:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
Noble second that so we have an
 
05:04:52.030 --> 05:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
amendment before us 03
 
05:04:54.390 --> 05:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
91h uh that's
 
05:04:57.230 --> 05:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
2419 presented by representative cord
 
05:04:58.910 --> 05:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
cordelli and second by representative
 
05:05:01.230 --> 05:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
Noble representa cordelli uh thank you
 
05:05:02.990 --> 05:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
05:05:07.190 --> 05:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment um it modifies U page two of
 
05:05:11.430 --> 05:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
the original Amendment which had um four
 
05:05:13.230 --> 05:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
uh definitions for material that is
 
05:05:17.510 --> 05:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
harmful to minors um three were taken
 
05:05:19.670 --> 05:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
from the Miller versus
 
05:05:23.470 --> 05:05:23.480 align:start position:0%
California um Supreme Court ruling as to
 
05:05:24.788 --> 05:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
what is harmful to
 
05:05:27.708 --> 05:05:27.718 align:start position:0%
minors um I guess I tried to pay play
 
05:05:30.830 --> 05:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court Justice and added a fourth
 
05:05:33.910 --> 05:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
um which is probably not NE necessary um
 
05:05:35.628 --> 05:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
I don't think I'd make a very good
 
05:05:37.548 --> 05:05:37.558 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
05:05:40.150 --> 05:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
justice so it deletes at number four it
 
05:05:43.310 --> 05:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
deletes number four yet
 
05:05:46.390 --> 05:05:46.400 align:start position:0%

leus yes originally the bill had two
 
05:09:55.708 --> 05:09:55.718 align:start position:0%
parts to it one which allowed a student
 
05:09:57.708 --> 05:09:57.718 align:start position:0%
to stay in the
 
05:10:01.030 --> 05:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
school and continue taking courses that
 
05:10:03.868 --> 05:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
was directed at somebody who wanted to
 
05:10:07.110 --> 05:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
start like the
 
05:10:10.708 --> 05:10:10.718 align:start position:0%
um violin player who was phenomenal and
 
05:10:14.230 --> 05:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to get to work performing with an
 
05:10:17.510 --> 05:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
a an orchestra but still wanted to take
 
05:10:21.190 --> 05:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
a few courses at the high school but
 
05:10:23.628 --> 05:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
there is a way that that can be done if
 
05:10:26.270 --> 05:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
they become a homeschool student and if
 
05:10:27.990 --> 05:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
the parent doesn't get in trouble for
 
05:10:28.000 --> 05:10:29.270 align:start position:0%
the parent doesn't get in trouble for
not

05:10:29.270 --> 05:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:10:31.670 --> 05:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
teaching uh the required courses and
 
05:10:33.548 --> 05:10:33.558 align:start position:0%
allowing their student to go ahead and
 
05:10:36.110 --> 05:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
spend their day with the orchestra that
 
05:10:38.070 --> 05:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
student could then go
 
05:10:41.548 --> 05:10:41.558 align:start position:0%
to the um like
 
05:10:44.990 --> 05:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
the CTE Center and take a business
 
05:10:48.830 --> 05:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
course um so I took that out and all
 
05:10:52.430 --> 05:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
this covers is the student who knows the
 
05:10:54.750 --> 05:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
stuff and just wants to be done with
 
05:10:57.868 --> 05:10:57.878 align:start position:0%
school with high with high school or
 
05:10:59.750 --> 05:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
School in general so they can get on
 
05:11:01.110 --> 05:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
with the things that they want to do
 
05:11:03.708 --> 05:11:03.718 align:start position:0%
with their life thank you very much oh
 
05:11:05.470 --> 05:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
you're done well no I was just going to
 
05:11:07.868 --> 05:11:07.878 align:start position:0%
say I found it very interesting when I
 
05:11:11.270 --> 05:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
was um in the hallway after introducing
 
05:11:14.190 --> 05:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
this bill and there were some guys
 
05:11:16.390 --> 05:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
talking who were waiting to testify in
 
05:11:19.150 --> 05:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
another bill and one of them was like oh
 
05:11:21.948 --> 05:11:21.958 align:start position:0%
my goodness I would have loved to have
 
05:11:23.708 --> 05:11:23.718 align:start position:0%
this when I was in school so I didn't
 
05:11:26.270 --> 05:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
have to stay in prison and he used that
 
05:11:28.270 --> 05:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
same term that the guy who came in and
 
05:11:30.510 --> 05:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
testified who know I did not know it was
 
05:11:35.110 --> 05:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
going to be there and and testify um
 
05:11:39.150 --> 05:11:39.160 align:start position:0%
that is the feeling of a certain portion
 
05:11:41.830 --> 05:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not I loved school I wanted
 
05:11:43.948 --> 05:11:43.958 align:start position:0%
to keep going and going and going okay
 
05:11:47.830 --> 05:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
let's let's stick to this bill please
 
05:11:51.670 --> 05:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
yep further discussion on the
 
05:11:54.230 --> 05:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
amendment yes represent Woodcock thank
 
05:11:57.110 --> 05:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
you Le can you explain about the the
 
05:11:58.628 --> 05:11:58.638 align:start position:0%
paying for the
 
05:12:00.990 --> 05:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
exam first out the educational trust
 
05:12:03.430 --> 05:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
fund and second for the the not
 
05:12:04.910 --> 05:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
successful student I don't understand
 
05:12:07.270 --> 05:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
the paying for the
 
05:12:11.190 --> 05:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
exam the idea for that was I did not
 
05:12:14.390 --> 05:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
want any student from a poor family to
 
05:12:17.830 --> 05:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
be denied this right because they
 
05:12:20.708 --> 05:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
couldn't um or denied this opportunity I
 
05:12:23.390 --> 05:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
should say because they couldn't pay for
 
05:12:28.070 --> 05:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
it and it will save the this the state a
 
05:12:31.510 --> 05:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
fair amount of money $4,000 and some
 
05:12:35.788 --> 05:12:35.798 align:start position:0%
dollar every year um if they do stop
 
05:12:38.830 --> 05:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
going to school so it seemed reasonable
 
05:12:40.708 --> 05:12:40.718 align:start position:0%
that the state could pay that small
 
05:12:43.750 --> 05:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
amount for the exam however I didn't
 
05:12:47.110 --> 05:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
want kids just taking advantage of that
 
05:12:50.070 --> 05:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
whether they had no hope or chance of
 
05:12:53.150 --> 05:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
passing and just keep you know taking
 
05:12:56.390 --> 05:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
the exam so the idea was to limit it to
 
05:12:59.830 --> 05:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
the first time to one time so that they
 
05:13:01.310 --> 05:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take it unless they were pretty
 
05:13:04.430 --> 05:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
sure they can pass it PA Mr sheer please
 
05:13:07.830 --> 05:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
yes I I still understand the money for
 
05:13:10.708 --> 05:13:10.718 align:start position:0%
the exam who's who's paying whom how
 
05:13:12.750 --> 05:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
much do it cost why would they have to
 
05:13:15.750 --> 05:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
pay for an exam because the exam is
 
05:13:17.948 --> 05:13:17.958 align:start position:0%
probably going to be like the highet or
 
05:13:20.350 --> 05:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
the GED and said the commissioner is
 
05:13:21.948 --> 05:13:21.958 align:start position:0%
going to do it
 
05:13:24.910 --> 05:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
WR I said the commissioner of the
 
05:13:27.788 --> 05:13:27.798 align:start position:0%
Department of Education shall choose and
 
05:13:30.548 --> 05:13:30.558 align:start position:0%
the commissioner may choose the highet
 
05:13:33.470 --> 05:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
and the highet does have an age
 
05:13:36.830 --> 05:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
exemption that can be made so
 
05:13:41.070 --> 05:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
that any age could take it thank you
 
05:13:43.310 --> 05:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chair further further
 
05:13:45.948 --> 05:13:45.958 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Pell yes thank you
 
05:13:50.190 --> 05:13:50.200 align:start position:0%
very much um I remember I don't know how
 
05:13:51.470 --> 05:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
long ago it was but when they were
 
05:13:53.750 --> 05:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
changing the age of compulsory
 
05:13:57.030 --> 05:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
attendance from 16 to 18
 
05:13:59.548 --> 05:13:59.558 align:start position:0%
and I was I remember thinking what are
 
05:14:00.948 --> 05:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
they going to do with these students
 
05:14:03.390 --> 05:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
from 16 to 18 maybe they were struggling
 
05:14:04.990 --> 05:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
already to keep them in school and now
 
05:14:08.510 --> 05:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
they have to stay in school and you you
 
05:14:10.750 --> 05:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
know no matter what we do for some
 
05:14:13.270 --> 05:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
people I still think school doesn't
 
05:14:15.910 --> 05:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
always fit everybody and that man that
 
05:14:16.948 --> 05:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
came in and
 
05:14:19.548 --> 05:14:19.558 align:start position:0%
testified um he I went out in the
 
05:14:21.788 --> 05:14:21.798 align:start position:0%
hallway afterwards and I said to him
 
05:14:24.070 --> 05:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for testifying you are exactly
 
05:14:26.150 --> 05:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
the person who I thought of when I
 
05:14:28.430 --> 05:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
agreed to co-sponsor this legislation so
 
05:14:31.708 --> 05:14:31.718 align:start position:0%
even if it only helps one person I don't
 
05:14:33.910 --> 05:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
expect that a lot of people are ever a
 
05:14:36.470 --> 05:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
lot of students are actually going to
 
05:14:38.750 --> 05:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
utilize this but if it gives some
 
05:14:41.910 --> 05:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
struggling students a way out then I'm
 
05:14:43.310 --> 05:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
in support of this
 
05:14:45.310 --> 05:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
bill further
 
05:14:48.670 --> 05:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Hall how young
 
05:14:50.670 --> 05:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
what's the youngest a kid could be in
 
05:14:53.470 --> 05:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
this there's no age there's no age limit
 
05:14:55.190 --> 05:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
on this one five years old could just
 
05:14:56.470 --> 05:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
say I'm not going school don't have to
 
05:14:59.270 --> 05:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
go to school they would have to pass the
 
05:15:02.708 --> 05:15:02.718 align:start position:0%
high test which is recognized as the
 
05:15:05.628 --> 05:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
high school equivalency which lots of
 
05:15:08.628 --> 05:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
kids take rather than getting a diploma
 
05:15:10.670 --> 05:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
like a good portion of the homeschool
 
05:15:13.590 --> 05:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
kids and other kids both of all of my
 
05:15:17.230 --> 05:15:17.240 align:start position:0%

motion
so

05:38:33.030 --> 05:38:33.040 align:start position:0%

05:38:35.708 --> 05:38:35.718 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to recognize you thank you
 
05:38:37.468 --> 05:38:37.478 align:start position:0%
Mr chair at this point in time I
 
05:38:45.788 --> 05:38:45.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:50.030 --> 05:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
study yes thank you I know I speak for
 
05:38:51.750 --> 05:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
several members of the committee when I
 
05:38:54.190 --> 05:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
say that this bill as is although well-
 
05:38:57.230 --> 05:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
intended I could not vote for there are
 
05:38:59.990 --> 05:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
several concerns such as
 
05:39:02.030 --> 05:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
the parental consent is not mentioned
 
05:39:05.510 --> 05:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
within this bill and I believe that that
 
05:39:08.350 --> 05:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
is a mistake as well as students after
 
05:39:10.230 --> 05:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
taking this test they're away from
 
05:39:11.788 --> 05:39:11.798 align:start position:0%
compulsory attendance but they would
 
05:39:14.750 --> 05:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
still be able to attend school and there
 
05:39:16.788 --> 05:39:16.798 align:start position:0%
could be problems with that and to
 
05:39:16.798 --> 05:39:18.350 align:start position:0%
could be problems with that and to
students

05:39:18.350 --> 05:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:39:22.910 --> 05:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
who are not willing or not requesting to
 
05:39:24.990 --> 05:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
continue school because they'd like to
 
05:39:27.430 --> 05:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
seek higher education I'd recommend the
 
05:39:28.990 --> 05:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
programs we have in place such as our
 
05:39:31.468 --> 05:39:31.478 align:start position:0%
dual conr current current enrollment
 
05:39:33.910 --> 05:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
courses excuse me so at this time I
 
05:39:35.750 --> 05:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
think interim study is a better motion
 
05:39:37.510 --> 05:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
so that this bill could be worked on and
 
05:39:39.670 --> 05:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps improved and that's all I have
 
05:39:41.430 --> 05:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
to say thank you thank you very much
 
05:39:41.440 --> 05:39:43.830 align:start position:0%
to say thank you thank you very much
further

05:39:43.830 --> 05:39:43.840 align:start position:0%

05:39:55.628 --> 05:39:55.638 align:start position:0%
affirmative fashion before I before I
 
05:39:58.350 --> 05:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
vote on uh interim study though I would
 
05:40:01.468 --> 05:40:01.478 align:start position:0%
like to ask former Deputy Commissioner
 
05:40:05.110 --> 05:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
of Education Mary Heath to address the
 
05:40:07.830 --> 05:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
issue of what's already available for
 
05:40:10.310 --> 05:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
students who are 16 years or older who
 
05:40:13.110 --> 05:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
want to leave school early if I may Mr
 
05:40:15.590 --> 05:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
chair I'd like to have Mary address this
 
05:40:18.030 --> 05:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
represent Heath if art Ellison were here
 
05:40:19.868 --> 05:40:19.878 align:start position:0%
he could give you a better detailed
 
05:40:24.270 --> 05:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
summary than I but um it is possible now
 
05:40:26.990 --> 05:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
um to gain permission if a student is
 
05:40:30.190 --> 05:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18 um and at least 16
 
05:40:32.150 --> 05:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
to request permission from the
 
05:40:36.070 --> 05:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed to take the GED or
 
05:40:39.708 --> 05:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
equivalent test um and attain a a
 
05:40:41.948 --> 05:40:41.958 align:start position:0%
diploma now the diploma does not come
 
05:40:44.310 --> 05:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
from the school district it comes it
 
05:40:48.830 --> 05:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
would be um a a document saying that
 
05:40:50.910 --> 05:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
they had passed a test and that they
 
05:40:54.350 --> 05:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
have uh achieved equivalency to high
 
05:40:56.270 --> 05:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
school further
 
05:40:59.788 --> 05:40:59.798 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Tanner so one of
 
05:41:01.990 --> 05:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
the main differences in in what we see
 
05:41:04.230 --> 05:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
in this bill and what you're saying is
 
05:41:06.868 --> 05:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
that in this bill they actually get a
 
05:41:09.150 --> 05:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
diploma from the high school that that
 
05:41:11.990 --> 05:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
they decide they don't want to go to is
 
05:41:14.230 --> 05:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
that correct or the state they could
 
05:41:17.590 --> 05:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
they could get it just says they may and
 
05:41:20.150 --> 05:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
if the state if the district says no
 
05:41:21.468 --> 05:41:21.478 align:start position:0%
then it's from the
 
05:41:25.628 --> 05:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
state and this excuse me and a state has
 
05:41:25.638 --> 05:41:26.430 align:start position:0%
state and this excuse me and a state has
a

05:41:26.430 --> 05:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:41:28.990 --> 05:41:29.000 align:start position:0%

basically it rearranges
 
05:45:41.390 --> 05:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
thing I left all my Amendment stuff in
 
05:45:43.390 --> 05:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
the other room is is do you have a
 
05:45:43.400 --> 05:45:46.390 align:start position:0%
the other room is is do you have a
copy

05:45:46.390 --> 05:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
copy
 
05:45:49.070 --> 05:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
yeah can you walk us through the changes
 
05:45:50.990 --> 05:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
in the amendment please yeah the changes
 
05:45:51.000 --> 05:45:52.468 align:start position:0%
in the amendment please yeah the changes
aren't

05:45:52.468 --> 05:45:52.478 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
05:45:57.230 --> 05:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
um uh content it's more of clarification
 
05:45:59.708 --> 05:45:59.718 align:start position:0%
because a lot of the
 
05:46:01.910 --> 05:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
the things that this is in an open
 
05:46:04.030 --> 05:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment section and a lot of the
 
05:46:06.350 --> 05:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
steps are the same as open enrollment so
 
05:46:08.468 --> 05:46:08.478 align:start position:0%
the original Bill tried to kind of just
 
05:46:10.750 --> 05:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
insert those there it made it very
 
05:46:12.990 --> 05:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
unclear um whether we were talking about
 
05:46:14.590 --> 05:46:14.600 align:start position:0%
Open Enrollment or talking about
 
05:46:17.150 --> 05:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
something else and so the idea was to
 
05:46:20.750 --> 05:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
bring the things that have to do with um
 
05:46:24.030 --> 05:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
children of School Employees into
 
05:46:26.110 --> 05:46:26.120 align:start position:0%
separate sections therefore that's why
 
05:46:30.030 --> 05:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
it's uh Roman 3- a and Roman numeral 9-
 
05:46:32.670 --> 05:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
a and Roman numeral 1- a so that it
 
05:46:36.110 --> 05:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
separates it out in that chapter of law
 
05:46:37.990 --> 05:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
there already is a section that's
 
05:46:40.110 --> 05:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
similar to that that's on military
 
05:46:42.750 --> 05:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
personnel so it it breaks that out of
 
05:46:44.948 --> 05:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
the Open Enrollment section too so it's
 
05:46:46.788 --> 05:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
there's a precedent for doing that I
 
05:46:48.910 --> 05:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
think this brings it all in line with
 
05:46:52.830 --> 05:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:55.830 --> 05:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
written are there any questions
 
05:47:00.070 --> 05:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
or discussion on that yes represent
 
05:47:04.230 --> 05:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
um as I look at um for any for line
 
05:47:07.430 --> 05:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
17 um the cost of any will be by payroll
 
05:47:09.430 --> 05:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
deduction makes me chuckle because I
 
05:47:11.510 --> 05:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
think our Paras in our school district
 
05:47:13.150 --> 05:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
have to pay the I mean there been a
 
05:47:14.468 --> 05:47:14.478 align:start position:0%
situation they had to pay the school
 
05:47:15.788 --> 05:47:15.798 align:start position:0%
district just to get the health
 
05:47:17.788 --> 05:47:17.798 align:start position:0%
insurance so I don't think it's coming
 
05:47:20.150 --> 05:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
out of payroll you know what I mean like
 
05:47:22.070 --> 05:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
they didn't make enough money even they
 
05:47:23.390 --> 05:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
just barely covered their health
 
05:47:26.510 --> 05:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
insurance that's why it's the or yeah
 
05:47:27.990 --> 05:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
yeah but I just want to make that
 
05:47:31.230 --> 05:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
statement but also so um this is
 
05:47:33.670 --> 05:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
typically contractual whether it's a
 
05:47:35.310 --> 05:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
Paris or whether it's the teacher Union
 
05:47:37.390 --> 05:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
I mean this is something you negotiate
 
05:47:40.270 --> 05:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
on whether you can um like our
 
05:47:42.030 --> 05:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
administrators their kids can go to
 
05:47:44.070 --> 05:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
school and Bowl but we could not do it
 
05:47:45.590 --> 05:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
we couldn't even to wish our kids in but
 
05:47:47.788 --> 05:47:47.798 align:start position:0%
it was a contractual thing this is
 
05:47:51.030 --> 05:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
negotiated so that's all right and this
 
05:47:52.548 --> 05:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
even it's the playing field throughout
 
05:47:52.558 --> 05:47:56.628 align:start position:0%
even it's the playing field throughout
the

05:47:56.628 --> 05:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:02.350 --> 05:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:06.070 --> 05:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
from the from the Schoolboard
 
05:48:09.750 --> 05:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
perspective this may um take a
 
05:48:14.948 --> 05:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:18.110 --> 05:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
plate that that's just the consequences
 
05:48:20.788 --> 05:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
of that what may do but it also would
 
05:48:22.070 --> 05:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
though on the other side of the coin
 
05:48:24.468 --> 05:48:24.478 align:start position:0%
have certainly help the teacher who has
 
05:48:25.788 --> 05:48:25.798 align:start position:0%
their Child Left Behind in their
 
05:48:27.190 --> 05:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
resident community and they're working
 
05:48:29.230 --> 05:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
next door or down the road
 
05:48:31.270 --> 05:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
ways and they're trying to figure out
 
05:48:33.070 --> 05:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
what to do with the child you know
 
05:48:36.110 --> 05:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
because they can't get home to get and
 
05:48:37.590 --> 05:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
where there is a teacher shortage going
 
05:48:39.430 --> 05:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
on so you're sort of in between fa
 
05:48:39.440 --> 05:48:41.070 align:start position:0%
on so you're sort of in between fa
places

05:48:41.070 --> 05:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
places
 
05:48:44.708 --> 05:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
here represent Damon
 
05:48:47.150 --> 05:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
so just to make sure I'm understanding
 
05:48:49.310 --> 05:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
this when it says in line five that
 
05:48:50.788 --> 05:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
non-resident employees of the school
 
05:48:52.830 --> 05:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
district May enroll their children in
 
05:48:54.670 --> 05:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
the school district that does not sound
 
05:48:56.070 --> 05:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
to me like the school district is
 
05:48:59.350 --> 05:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
obligated to accept them
 
05:49:02.628 --> 05:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
was that am I reading that
 
05:49:04.590 --> 05:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
right ref
 
05:49:08.270 --> 05:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
try actually the what it's means is that
 
05:49:11.468 --> 05:49:11.478 align:start position:0%
there there are they can try they can do
 
05:49:13.910 --> 05:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
that but the school has the option to
 
05:49:16.390 --> 05:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
say no there's not adequate space or we
 
05:49:18.310 --> 05:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
need additional staff or classrooms need
 
05:49:19.990 --> 05:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:49:22.750 --> 05:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
added so if there was
 
05:49:26.030 --> 05:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
space and nothing has to be
 
05:49:29.310 --> 05:49:29.320 align:start position:0%
changed could they still say no
 
05:49:32.590 --> 05:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh no they can't this is the the
 
05:49:34.590 --> 05:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
emphasis is on but it's the impetus is
 
05:49:36.310 --> 05:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
on the side of the parent yeah this like
 
05:49:38.310 --> 05:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
not you don't have to do this this is
 
05:49:40.590 --> 05:49:40.600 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation and I just want to
 
05:49:43.070 --> 05:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
say that for recruiting and retention
 
05:49:45.868 --> 05:49:45.878 align:start position:0%
this would be a nice piece um to offer
 
05:49:48.190 --> 05:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
people and and our weather in the last
 
05:49:51.430 --> 05:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
two weeks has just only um been a good
 
05:49:53.670 --> 05:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
example of why you would love to have
 
05:49:55.510 --> 05:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
families on the same educational
 
05:49:58.670 --> 05:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
schedule if you could possibly do that
 
05:50:00.548 --> 05:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
now I've got another question and it's
 
05:50:03.468 --> 05:50:03.478 align:start position:0%
kind of just digging down as my mind's
 
05:50:06.390 --> 05:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
going you're in a k through6 school and
 
05:50:08.430 --> 05:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
your school district tuitions these kids
 
05:50:11.990 --> 05:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
for grades 7 through 12 to other
 
05:50:12.000 --> 05:50:14.430 align:start position:0%
for grades 7 through 12 to other
receiving

05:50:14.430 --> 05:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:14.440 --> 05:50:15.948 align:start position:0%
 
districts

05:50:15.948 --> 05:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
districts
 
05:50:18.910 --> 05:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
um how's that going to work in terms of
 
05:50:21.708 --> 05:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
this this law right
 
05:50:24.190 --> 05:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
here I believe School Board have to
 
05:50:27.948 --> 05:50:27.958 align:start position:0%
approve or um you go to the the school
 
05:50:30.830 --> 05:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
that you get into you get to finish yeah
 
05:50:32.430 --> 05:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
if for example if you go to the school
 
05:50:35.270 --> 05:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
that the school resending schools has a
 
05:50:38.110 --> 05:50:38.120 align:start position:0%
contract as a receiving school then
 
05:50:40.390 --> 05:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
they'll obviously pay that
 
05:50:42.948 --> 05:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
tuition uh however if you're going to
 
05:50:45.548 --> 05:50:45.558 align:start position:0%
another District that they don't have a
 
05:50:48.788 --> 05:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
contract with how's that going to
 
05:50:51.868 --> 05:50:51.878 align:start position:0%
work that's a really good question um I
 
05:50:53.468 --> 05:50:53.478 align:start position:0%
think that's maybe a matter of the
 
05:50:54.708 --> 05:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
policy of the
 
05:50:56.910 --> 05:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
school because not every school is going
 
05:50:59.750 --> 05:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
to have that situation
 
05:51:01.750 --> 05:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
or this policy of the district well I'm
 
05:51:03.708 --> 05:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
saying does the sending school district
 
05:51:07.590 --> 05:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
have to pay that extra $244,000 instead
 
05:51:09.990 --> 05:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
of the $20,000 load for the district
 
05:51:12.390 --> 05:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
that they don't have the contract with
 
05:51:13.670 --> 05:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to who pays that I'm going to
 
05:51:15.590 --> 05:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
refer again it's it's the parents are
 
05:51:18.830 --> 05:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
Guardian to be um as per District policy
 
05:51:20.548 --> 05:51:20.558 align:start position:0%
so it's going to vary from District to
 
05:51:20.558 --> 05:51:22.310 align:start position:0%
so it's going to vary from District to
District

05:51:22.310 --> 05:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
District
 
05:51:26.070 --> 05:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
% so would we I'm I'm sorry but so then
 
05:51:28.350 --> 05:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
we just passed legislation last year
 
05:51:30.468 --> 05:51:30.478 align:start position:0%
where the parent can pay the difference
 
05:51:32.750 --> 05:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
is that what would happen is that in
 
05:51:35.708 --> 05:51:35.718 align:start position:0%
effect now I believe so yes so yeah that
 
05:51:38.510 --> 05:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
was part of the Bridgewater Bill no I
 
05:51:50.190 --> 05:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:54.270 --> 05:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
it's further chair yeah yeah I I've sort
 
05:51:58.990 --> 05:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
of got some some um I think to our
 
05:52:02.750 --> 05:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
concerns about this so looking at 194
 
05:52:06.310 --> 05:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
deol and 2 and and as representative dry
 
05:52:09.670 --> 05:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
said that is the chapter on open
 
05:52:12.868 --> 05:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
enrollment um for example in the first
 
05:52:15.468 --> 05:52:15.478 align:start position:0%
part of that chapter under definitions
 
05:52:20.390 --> 05:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:23.110 --> 05:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
district and it defines receiving
 
05:52:25.468 --> 05:52:25.478 align:start position:0%
District so receiving District means the
 
05:52:27.708 --> 05:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
school district which the pupil is sent
 
05:52:30.990 --> 05:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
to attend an open open enrollment School
 
05:52:32.548 --> 05:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
resident District means the school
 
05:52:34.868 --> 05:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
district in which the student resides
 
05:52:36.670 --> 05:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
sending District means the school
 
05:52:39.868 --> 05:52:39.878 align:start position:0%
district in which the pupil
 
05:52:39.878 --> 05:52:44.910 align:start position:0%
district in which the pupil
resides

05:52:44.910 --> 05:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:47.430 --> 05:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
um receiving District means the school
 
05:52:49.070 --> 05:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
district which the pupil is sent to
 
05:52:52.670 --> 05:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
attend an open enrollment school so is
 
05:52:56.548 --> 05:52:56.558 align:start position:0%
that what's meant in in the the
 
05:53:01.548 --> 05:53:01.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:03.910 --> 05:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
9A what line
 
05:53:07.590 --> 05:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
on 12 yeah you've got sending and
 
05:53:10.350 --> 05:53:10.360 align:start position:0%
receiving district and uh yeah lines 12
 
05:53:15.070 --> 05:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:18.430 --> 05:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
so I would think so yeah so this is
 
05:53:20.350 --> 05:53:20.360 align:start position:0%
intended only to apply to open
 
05:53:23.708 --> 05:53:23.718 align:start position:0%
enrollment no no this is an ex it is
 
05:53:25.990 --> 05:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
like an open enrollment but it is not
 
05:53:28.510 --> 05:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
exactly as an open enrollment so the o
 
05:53:31.708 --> 05:53:31.718 align:start position:0%
Open Enrollment as it's defined here is
 
05:53:33.910 --> 05:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
is a school district that might have
 
05:53:35.548 --> 05:53:35.558 align:start position:0%
different schools that serve different
 
05:53:37.430 --> 05:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
parts of the community or different
 
05:53:39.468 --> 05:53:39.478 align:start position:0%
parts of the district open rollment is a
 
05:53:41.830 --> 05:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
vote that school districts take right
 
05:53:43.788 --> 05:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
but I'm just saying as it's as it's
 
05:53:47.350 --> 05:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
defined in here though means any public
 
05:53:50.110 --> 05:53:50.120 align:start position:0%
school um in addition to providing ed
 
05:53:52.110 --> 05:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
Service pupils residing within its
 
05:53:54.468 --> 05:53:54.478 align:start position:0%
attendance area or
 
05:53:56.948 --> 05:53:56.958 align:start position:0%
District choose to accept pupils from
 
05:53:58.628 --> 05:53:58.638 align:start position:0%
other attendance areas
 
05:54:01.670 --> 05:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
within its district oh and from outside
 
05:54:04.670 --> 05:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
the district okay right so it's open to
 
05:54:07.868 --> 05:54:07.878 align:start position:0%
any yeah any open enrollment you're
 
05:54:09.468 --> 05:54:09.478 align:start position:0%
trying to you're trying to capture those
 
05:54:10.590 --> 05:54:10.600 align:start position:0%
kids to
 
05:54:14.468 --> 05:54:14.478 align:start position:0%
help the operational cost of that that
 
05:54:17.468 --> 05:54:17.478 align:start position:0%
District that open enrollment school
 
05:54:20.708 --> 05:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
right right well you're
 
05:54:24.590 --> 05:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
you but which this would do as well and
 
05:54:26.990 --> 05:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
would cut down on substitute time
 
05:54:30.110 --> 05:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:33.150 --> 05:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
um parents having to teachers having to
 
05:54:34.910 --> 05:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
stay home because their kids school
 
05:54:37.628 --> 05:54:37.638 align:start position:0%
district was closed due to
 
05:54:40.310 --> 05:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
weather right in many cases I mean I
 
05:54:43.468 --> 05:54:43.478 align:start position:0%
think as as as chair lad said that's a
 
05:54:45.510 --> 05:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
negotiated item in collective bargaining
 
05:54:47.990 --> 05:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
agreements and and it is in a lot of
 
05:54:52.708 --> 05:54:52.718 align:start position:0%
districts um um you know I I I I I
 
05:54:54.788 --> 05:54:54.798 align:start position:0%
certainly I think from the school boards
 
05:54:56.510 --> 05:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
from my perspective having been on a
 
05:54:58.948 --> 05:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
school board I wouldn't want lose this
 
05:55:02.628 --> 05:55:02.638 align:start position:0%
as a as a negotiating item and and I
 
05:55:04.628 --> 05:55:04.638 align:start position:0%
don't want to I don't want to you know
 
05:55:09.708 --> 05:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
sort of imply hearsay on on the um the
 
05:55:12.750 --> 05:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
uh faculty Representatives but in
 
05:55:14.548 --> 05:55:14.558 align:start position:0%
speaking with Mr Hawkins he said no
 
05:55:17.628 --> 05:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not looking for this so
 
05:55:22.230 --> 05:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
I I I I'm not quite sure what the what
 
05:55:24.990 --> 05:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
the you know what the interest is uh
 
05:55:26.548 --> 05:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
behind this I think it's in a very
 
05:55:29.910 --> 05:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
strange section of the of the law
 
05:55:31.070 --> 05:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
despite the
 
05:55:34.750 --> 05:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
breakouts um
 
05:55:38.230 --> 05:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
um so could I do a point of order too
 
05:55:41.548 --> 05:55:41.558 align:start position:0%
please what's your point of order um if
 
05:55:44.310 --> 05:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment is
 
05:55:47.230 --> 05:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
0316 it's submitted by representative C
 
05:55:50.190 --> 05:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
from AAC 26 who's not on this
 
05:55:54.990 --> 05:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
committee I I yep go ahead no I believe
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
as long as it's submitted by a Committee
 
05:55:58.830 --> 05:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
Member it's fine
 
05:56:00.430 --> 05:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
yeah the rule in that is that a
 
05:56:02.910 --> 05:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
Committee Member can introduce an
 
05:56:04.708 --> 05:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
amendment such as this that some other
 
05:56:07.390 --> 05:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
person in the house if it's a senate uh
 
05:56:09.910 --> 05:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
we can't do it because it has to have a
 
05:56:12.030 --> 05:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
representative in the in general court
 
05:56:14.310 --> 05:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
on the amendment we have one right there
 
05:56:16.310 --> 05:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
I yeah I thought it you had to you had
 
05:56:17.868 --> 05:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
to be your name had to be on the
 
05:56:21.110 --> 05:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
amendment here no no sorry thank you
 
05:56:23.510 --> 05:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
clarification lot of rules aren't there
 
05:56:23.520 --> 05:56:25.070 align:start position:0%
clarification lot of rules aren't there
yeah

05:56:25.070 --> 05:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:56:27.990 --> 05:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative uh Heath you're
 
05:56:30.430 --> 05:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
red lights on that yes um please I just
 
05:56:33.628 --> 05:56:33.638 align:start position:0%
a question so in a scenario let's say
 
05:56:37.708 --> 05:56:37.718 align:start position:0%
for instance um I'm a teacher in Bedford
 
05:56:39.990 --> 05:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
and um my kids currently go to school in
 
05:56:42.990 --> 05:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester but because I'm a teacher in
 
05:56:45.948 --> 05:56:45.958 align:start position:0%
Bedford I want my kids to be in Bedford
 
05:56:52.030 --> 05:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
with me so um I would pay the tuition at
 
05:56:56.270 --> 05:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
the full 80% of what the average tuition
 
05:56:59.510 --> 05:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
is I'm just not clear on what is the
 
05:57:02.628 --> 05:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the teacher in terms
 
05:57:05.628 --> 05:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
of um cost and
 
05:57:08.070 --> 05:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
secondly when I was an assistant
 
05:57:11.310 --> 05:57:11.320 align:start position:0%
superintendent we often had requests
 
05:57:13.830 --> 05:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
from staff members to have the children
 
05:57:15.788 --> 05:57:15.798 align:start position:0%
go to the school district where they
 
05:57:18.990 --> 05:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
were working and it was always up to the
 
05:57:23.030 --> 05:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
school board to decide and in most
 
05:57:26.910 --> 05:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances the school board did not
 
05:57:29.190 --> 05:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
approve unless the family was willing to
 
05:57:31.948 --> 05:57:31.958 align:start position:0%
pay the full tuition amount the full
 
05:57:34.150 --> 05:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
cost of what it would cost for the child
 
05:57:35.868 --> 05:57:35.878 align:start position:0%
to go there so I guess that's a whole
 
05:57:37.548 --> 05:57:37.558 align:start position:0%
bunch of
 
05:57:40.868 --> 05:57:40.878 align:start position:0%
questions it's a very complex issue when
 
05:57:42.548 --> 05:57:42.558 align:start position:0%
you start
 
05:57:47.190 --> 05:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
mixing kids and employees and and who's
 
05:57:49.910 --> 05:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
who makes the ultimate decisions and are
 
05:57:53.910 --> 05:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
we forced to um and the contractual
 
05:57:56.830 --> 05:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
issues so it's just there's a lot I
 
05:57:56.840 --> 05:57:59.670 align:start position:0%
issues so it's just there's a lot I
think

05:57:59.670 --> 05:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:58:03.110 --> 05:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
per Dr you had your hand up thank you I
 
05:58:04.468 --> 05:58:04.478 align:start position:0%
think that's why we put it under the
 
05:58:06.350 --> 05:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
school district policy because so many
 
05:58:08.670 --> 05:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
districts are there remember this is
 
05:58:11.628 --> 05:58:11.638 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation if this is honorous
 
05:58:14.070 --> 05:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
for family they just don't have to take
 
05:58:17.070 --> 05:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
that policy and to address Mr L
 
05:58:19.510 --> 05:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative luno I would I'd like to
 
05:58:23.750 --> 05:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
show you on page 637 in uh Deon 2 and
 
05:58:26.230 --> 05:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
it's Roman numeral 11 this is about
 
05:58:28.510 --> 05:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
military connected students
 
05:58:31.230 --> 05:58:31.240 align:start position:0%
and it goes on to say this is to Define
 
05:58:33.110 --> 05:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
them as children of full-time active
 
05:58:37.628 --> 05:58:37.638 align:start position:0%
duty um military personnel and it says
 
05:58:39.468 --> 05:58:39.478 align:start position:0%
they shall be eligible for admission to
 
05:58:42.030 --> 05:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
the school district of their choice it
 
05:58:43.830 --> 05:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't give anything about an open
 
05:58:45.548 --> 05:58:45.558 align:start position:0%
enrollment it doesn't give anything
 
05:58:47.830 --> 05:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
about that all just defines what a
 
05:58:49.948 --> 05:58:49.958 align:start position:0%
military person is and that's why we
 
05:58:51.708 --> 05:58:51.718 align:start position:0%
felt that this was a place to put
 
05:58:54.510 --> 05:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
another exception the students who are
 
05:58:58.390 --> 05:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
um children of uh staff and teachers in
 
05:58:59.350 --> 05:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
a school
 
05:59:01.670 --> 05:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
district just to respond to that Mr
 
05:59:05.150 --> 05:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
chair so so you know I I'm I'm not
 
05:59:07.788 --> 05:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
suggesting that that the statutes are
 
05:59:12.070 --> 05:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
perfect um in any way but but I I don't
 
05:59:13.830 --> 05:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
think continuing to
 
05:59:17.910 --> 05:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
misplace language or or you know or
 
05:59:20.948 --> 05:59:20.958 align:start position:0%
perpetuate that uh style is necessarily
 
05:59:25.948 --> 05:59:25.958 align:start position:0%
a good thing for clarity um you know but
 
05:59:29.830 --> 05:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
but I I would offer that that I I first
 
05:59:31.548 --> 05:59:31.558 align:start position:0%
I want to respond that it's it's not
 
05:59:33.350 --> 05:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
enable enabling legislation something
 
05:59:35.590 --> 05:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
that enables a district to do something
 
05:59:37.390 --> 05:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
this actually requires the district to
 
05:59:39.350 --> 05:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
comply so it's the opposite of enabling
 
05:59:41.468 --> 05:59:41.478 align:start position:0%
legislation yes it's the choice of the
 
05:59:43.788 --> 05:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
family to to whether or not they want to
 
05:59:47.110 --> 05:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
send their student to that to um have
 
05:59:49.628 --> 05:59:49.638 align:start position:0%
that student go to the district that the
 
05:59:52.708 --> 05:59:52.718 align:start position:0%
staff member faculty or staff member is
 
05:59:55.030 --> 05:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
that but this is an enabling legislation
 
05:59:57.030 --> 05:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
the district has to comply with that
 
05:59:57.040 --> 05:59:58.150 align:start position:0%
the district has to comply with that
secondly

05:59:58.150 --> 05:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
06:00:00.830 --> 06:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
and it it it occurred to me that that
 
06:00:03.070 --> 06:00:03.080 align:start position:0%
there could be some you know impact with
 
06:00:07.548 --> 06:00:07.558 align:start position:0%
respect to nhiaa and in inter Scholastic
 
06:00:10.868 --> 06:00:10.878 align:start position:0%
um Athletics because there there there
 
06:00:13.670 --> 06:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
are situations where where students who
 
06:00:15.628 --> 06:00:15.638 align:start position:0%
live in one District want to play ball
 
06:00:18.708 --> 06:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
let's say in another district and so um
 
06:00:22.910 --> 06:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
so um so it's been made clear that even
 
06:00:25.548 --> 06:00:25.558 align:start position:0%
though some districts do tuition in
 
06:00:28.070 --> 06:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
students that you can't do so
 
06:00:31.230 --> 06:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
based on uh based on simply an an
 
06:00:33.510 --> 06:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
athletic interest in that and I don't
 
06:00:36.468 --> 06:00:36.478 align:start position:0%
know what the law is on that but but you
 
06:00:38.468 --> 06:00:38.478 align:start position:0%
know I remember hearing about this years
 
06:00:41.948 --> 06:00:41.958 align:start position:0%
and years ago so so so now this this
 
06:00:45.230 --> 06:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
would allow a family member to take
 
06:00:49.510 --> 06:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
employment at such a district and um and
 
06:00:51.990 --> 06:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
and bring their child along possibly for
 
06:00:54.548 --> 06:00:54.558 align:start position:0%
an athletic interest um as opposed to
 
06:00:56.070 --> 06:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
something that was approved by the
 
06:00:58.230 --> 06:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
voters you know colle a bargaining
 
06:01:00.990 --> 06:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
agreement or something like that so so I
 
06:01:03.110 --> 06:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
I have a lot of concerns about um about
 
06:01:07.670 --> 06:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
this language represent uh Damon thank
 
06:01:10.468 --> 06:01:10.478 align:start position:0%
you so I have a
 
06:01:14.628 --> 06:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
question there are school districts that
 
06:01:16.788 --> 06:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
I guess would be open enrollment schools
 
06:01:19.548 --> 06:01:19.558 align:start position:0%
that they do take in tuition students
 
06:01:21.310 --> 06:01:21.320 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
06:01:24.468 --> 06:01:24.478 align:start position:0%
sunap but they interview and select who
 
06:01:25.788 --> 06:01:25.798 align:start position:0%
they will take
 
06:01:29.430 --> 06:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
in so if I'm a Snape teacher and I live
 
06:01:31.830 --> 06:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
in Newport and I want my child to go to
 
06:01:33.150 --> 06:01:33.160 align:start position:0%
school in
 
06:01:37.070 --> 06:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
sopee assuming that there is
 
06:01:39.310 --> 06:01:39.320 align:start position:0%
space not don't need additional staff
 
06:01:42.230 --> 06:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
and classrooms as the amendment
 
06:01:44.750 --> 06:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
says what happens with that interview
 
06:01:47.510 --> 06:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
process can sunap or whatever similar
 
06:01:50.230 --> 06:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
District still pick and choose who can
 
06:01:53.910 --> 06:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
go or if you're the child of an employee
 
06:01:56.350 --> 06:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:56.360 --> 06:01:58.510 align:start position:0%
 
automatically

06:01:58.510 --> 06:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
06:02:01.110 --> 06:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's a a real issue too that's
 
06:02:04.910 --> 06:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
over in sunap has that strange agreement
 
06:02:07.708 --> 06:02:07.718 align:start position:0%
where they're going to choose which kids
 
06:02:11.270 --> 06:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
come in from you're NE the woods lemster
 
06:02:14.230 --> 06:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
Goan yeah lemster Goan cord anywhere and
 
06:02:16.150 --> 06:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
actually something is not unique anymore
 
06:02:18.190 --> 06:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
newport's adopted the same thing well
 
06:02:20.110 --> 06:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
only because the anchor school is
 
06:02:23.830 --> 06:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
Newport there isn't an well it it used
 
06:02:27.110 --> 06:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
to be right and so it it's it gets a
 
06:02:28.910 --> 06:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
very convoluted comp I can tell you
 
06:02:31.510 --> 06:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
though on the athletic
 
06:02:35.670 --> 06:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
side when I was up north the schools
 
06:02:37.628 --> 06:02:37.638 align:start position:0%
around me were doing anything they could
 
06:02:39.350 --> 06:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
to get a hold of my two
 
06:02:42.590 --> 06:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
daughters one was the state champion in
 
06:02:45.190 --> 06:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
in a and and indoor and outdoor track up
 
06:02:47.910 --> 06:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
there they all wanted that and the other
 
06:02:50.468 --> 06:02:50.478 align:start position:0%
one was bass point guard they wanted her
 
06:02:54.708 --> 06:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
so the the the and I refused to go but
 
06:02:57.788 --> 06:02:57.798 align:start position:0%
the thing is that this is an issue
 
06:03:00.788 --> 06:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
and we've had it occur with the you know
 
06:03:03.510 --> 06:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
hockey and things like that they load up
 
06:03:06.468 --> 06:03:06.478 align:start position:0%
one school and and principles are pretty
 
06:03:08.070 --> 06:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
smart at that you know you look around I
 
06:03:09.910 --> 06:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
want the winning team and and you can
 
06:03:12.788 --> 06:03:12.798 align:start position:0%
get it very quickly just like that but
 
06:03:16.030 --> 06:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
NHA tried to clamp down on that but the
 
06:03:19.350 --> 06:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
way it used to be was a wide open Turf
 
06:03:21.750 --> 06:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock you have to sit out
 
06:03:24.070 --> 06:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
by C thank you CH I have two one comment
 
06:03:25.830 --> 06:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
or one question I want to make sure I'm
 
06:03:27.788 --> 06:03:27.798 align:start position:0%
understanding this um and the financial
 
06:03:29.708 --> 06:03:29.718 align:start position:0%
piece uh um if I understand this
 
06:03:32.150 --> 06:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
correctly on line 23 and 24 in the
 
06:03:35.310 --> 06:03:35.320 align:start position:0%
original bill it said the school uh
 
06:03:38.390 --> 06:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
sunding school pay no less than 80% and
 
06:03:40.390 --> 06:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
the rest is paid for by the the parent
 
06:03:42.590 --> 06:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
20% is that how I understand
 
06:03:46.590 --> 06:03:46.600 align:start position:0%
that yeah yeah so if that's the case
 
06:03:48.910 --> 06:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
what happens if the 80% in that sending
 
06:03:48.920 --> 06:03:49.830 align:start position:0%
what happens if the 80% in that sending
School

06:03:49.830 --> 06:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
School
 
06:03:53.190 --> 06:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
District um is a lot less than the
 
06:03:55.110 --> 06:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
receiving School District well that's
 
06:03:56.670 --> 06:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
align with the question I asked at the
 
06:03:58.110 --> 06:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
very beginning if especially if you're
 
06:03:59.910 --> 06:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
tuing them out from a school that's
 
06:04:02.230 --> 06:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't have those grade levels yeah let
 
06:04:04.430 --> 06:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
say something something is like $18
 
06:04:07.670 --> 06:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
$18,000 versus 26,000 yeah that's the
 
06:04:09.628 --> 06:04:09.638 align:start position:0%
first one the second initi me the second
 
06:04:12.350 --> 06:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
one is this is I know chairman you
 
06:04:14.468 --> 06:04:14.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this is part of the could
 
06:04:16.750 --> 06:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
be part of the teacher shortage uh
 
06:04:19.628 --> 06:04:19.638 align:start position:0%
retention issue however this is all
 
06:04:23.590 --> 06:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
staff all staff custodians secretaries
 
06:04:26.270 --> 06:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
parking water tenants this is all all
 
06:04:28.510 --> 06:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
staff so this could be a huge number of
 
06:04:30.990 --> 06:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
folks going there and not just teacher
 
06:04:34.310 --> 06:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
recruitment yeah okay make a comment
 
06:04:35.788 --> 06:04:35.798 align:start position:0%
that's all that's right represent thank
 
06:04:38.030 --> 06:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you um I just want to say if
 
06:04:39.390 --> 06:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
they wanted their daughters they' have
 
06:04:41.150 --> 06:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
to hire you so I'm just going to say
 
06:04:42.430 --> 06:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
that would have to been part of the
 
06:04:46.390 --> 06:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:49.190 --> 06:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
I five time screw to God yeah there you
 
06:04:52.830 --> 06:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
go um this works in other parts of the
 
06:04:54.948 --> 06:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
state I mean it's working in conal it's
 
06:04:57.190 --> 06:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
working in other places they get around
 
06:04:58.990 --> 06:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
this tuition thing they get around this
 
06:05:00.948 --> 06:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
if it's a bargaining chip it's because
 
06:05:02.708 --> 06:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
it works in places and I just want to
 
06:05:04.788 --> 06:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
see it work in the rest of the state
 
06:05:06.350 --> 06:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
there are ways around it I know that
 
06:05:07.628 --> 06:05:07.638 align:start position:0%
they're working on it otherwise it
 
06:05:07.638 --> 06:05:09.110 align:start position:0%
they're working on it otherwise it
wouldn't

06:05:09.110 --> 06:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
06:05:12.390 --> 06:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
exist further questions perap
 
06:05:16.350 --> 06:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
I thank just just as an aside we've
 
06:05:18.270 --> 06:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
talked about the athletic teams but I
 
06:05:21.590 --> 06:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
would also from an academic standpoint
 
06:05:23.430 --> 06:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
there may be somebody has a real good
 
06:05:26.190 --> 06:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
math team that would like to have a good
 
06:05:28.150 --> 06:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
math student to so I'm going to just
 
06:05:30.190 --> 06:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
throw in the issue of the academics as
 
06:05:32.590 --> 06:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
well as the Athletics I I really believe
 
06:05:35.390 --> 06:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
this is a local issue I mean we' we
 
06:05:38.070 --> 06:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
we've bounced around the ideas here and
 
06:05:39.430 --> 06:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be voting against this
 
06:05:41.990 --> 06:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
because I think if the local wants to do
 
06:05:43.510 --> 06:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
this they already have the prerogative
 
06:05:47.628 --> 06:05:47.638 align:start position:0%
to do it they can negotiate it um and
 
06:05:50.788 --> 06:05:50.798 align:start position:0%
not that I want to give up any kind of a
 
06:05:53.590 --> 06:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
perk for management but if you were to
 
06:05:56.070 --> 06:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
do this it does take away that perk for
 
06:05:58.948 --> 06:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
management and as a Union Advocate uh I
 
06:06:01.270 --> 06:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
would be concerned I'd be delighted
 
06:06:02.590 --> 06:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
because that means I don't have to give
 
06:06:05.670 --> 06:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
something up to get this yeah uh but um
 
06:06:08.468 --> 06:06:08.478 align:start position:0%
I think this is clearly a local issue
 
06:06:10.468 --> 06:06:10.478 align:start position:0%
and not withstanding the intent behind
 
06:06:12.948 --> 06:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
it I I recognize that intent and
 
06:06:15.230 --> 06:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate that but I do think that this
 
06:06:16.548 --> 06:06:16.558 align:start position:0%
is something that the local school
 
06:06:18.990 --> 06:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
boards and the the local organizations
 
06:06:21.628 --> 06:06:21.638 align:start position:0%
and unions can work this out
 
06:06:24.590 --> 06:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
themselves representa
 
06:06:28.190 --> 06:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
leus well I'm confused about some of the
 
06:06:31.830 --> 06:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
arguments because my understanding is
 
06:06:34.270 --> 06:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to come up with ways
 
06:06:34.280 --> 06:06:36.628 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to come up with ways
of

06:06:36.628 --> 06:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:39.270 --> 06:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
encouraging employment in schools
 
06:06:41.590 --> 06:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
because we're short not just in teachers
 
06:06:44.230 --> 06:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
but in AIDS and in
 
06:06:47.310 --> 06:06:47.320 align:start position:0%
all all sorts of positions in schools
 
06:06:50.030 --> 06:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to figure that out and
 
06:06:52.830 --> 06:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
yet the argument is we don't want to
 
06:06:56.030 --> 06:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
give up a bargaining position but I
 
06:06:59.510 --> 06:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
thought we were bargaining to get things
 
06:07:02.750 --> 06:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
for teachers and so if we're trying to
 
06:07:05.510 --> 06:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
help teachers and trying to retain them
 
06:07:06.948 --> 06:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
why do we have
 
06:07:10.030 --> 06:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
to why can't we just give this to
 
06:07:14.430 --> 06:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
teachers instead of I don't know I don't
 
06:07:16.830 --> 06:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
understand I what it would be all
 
06:07:18.670 --> 06:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
employes well all employees it says
 
06:07:18.680 --> 06:07:22.190 align:start position:0%
employes well all employees it says
staff

06:07:22.190 --> 06:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:26.350 --> 06:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
so repent Hall there are some unintended
 
06:07:30.510 --> 06:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
consequences so I'm a l teacher and I
 
06:07:34.390 --> 06:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
live between Franklin and Bo and I'm
 
06:07:37.150 --> 06:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
going to go teach in BO because my kid
 
06:07:41.070 --> 06:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
can go to B now and Franklin now has
 
06:07:42.868 --> 06:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
lost another person you know there's one
 
06:07:44.910 --> 06:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
thing on their salaries that they lose
 
06:07:46.110 --> 06:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
people and now they going to lose people
 
06:07:46.990 --> 06:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
because the kids are going to go to
 
06:07:48.910 --> 06:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
school somewhere else so I think that
 
06:07:50.788 --> 06:07:50.798 align:start position:0%
there are obviously the sports but I
 
06:07:52.150 --> 06:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
think it's way more it just sounds like
 
06:07:53.590 --> 06:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
a nightmare to me when I'm thinking of
 
06:07:56.868 --> 06:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
the whole staff most teachers don't and
 
06:07:58.708 --> 06:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
staff don't well staff I don't know what
 
06:08:00.708 --> 06:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
I'll say teachers most teachers don't
 
06:08:02.788 --> 06:08:02.798 align:start position:0%
live in the district where they teach so
 
06:08:05.110 --> 06:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
I mean this is a huge population of
 
06:08:08.070 --> 06:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
people that this covers I think it just
 
06:08:10.750 --> 06:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like a nightmare for it's it's
 
06:08:12.548 --> 06:08:12.558 align:start position:0%
great would every if I asked every
 
06:08:14.070 --> 06:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
teacher and every staff member in the
 
06:08:15.510 --> 06:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
school and say would you like to be able
 
06:08:17.110 --> 06:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
to send your kid a lot of them would
 
06:08:18.788 --> 06:08:18.798 align:start position:0%
probably say yeah yeah I think that's a
 
06:08:20.708 --> 06:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
good thing but I think the whole
 
06:08:23.750 --> 06:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
management just sounds like holy
 
06:08:26.390 --> 06:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
Snokes there there was a question that I
 
06:08:28.788 --> 06:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
had when this bill came in and I would
 
06:08:30.548 --> 06:08:30.558 align:start position:0%
like to have an answer on it if there's
 
06:08:34.548 --> 06:08:34.558 align:start position:0%
a teacher that has a handicapped
 
06:08:39.190 --> 06:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
student that has severe handicapping
 
06:08:41.590 --> 06:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
issues and requires special equipment
 
06:08:44.070 --> 06:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
special room
 
06:08:48.868 --> 06:08:48.878 align:start position:0%
Etc and and that that has occurred fact
 
06:08:50.990 --> 06:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
I can remember Dean Menner and I talking
 
06:08:53.070 --> 06:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
about this this goes back to the school
 
06:08:54.948 --> 06:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
boards about 12 years
 
06:08:57.670 --> 06:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
ago that
 
06:09:00.190 --> 06:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen when that school
 
06:09:02.868 --> 06:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
where the teacher is working and want
 
06:09:04.830 --> 06:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
wants to bring in this very handicapped
 
06:09:07.110 --> 06:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
child and the school does not have any
 
06:09:10.548 --> 06:09:10.558 align:start position:0%
of those facilities who Bears the cost
 
06:09:12.990 --> 06:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
because it says the child shall be able
 
06:09:16.030 --> 06:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
to come Mr chair that was that was
 
06:09:19.670 --> 06:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
cleared by by Miss fet yep she said that
 
06:09:21.830 --> 06:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
she said she said that the resident
 
06:09:23.628 --> 06:09:23.638 align:start position:0%
School District which I would assume is
 
06:09:25.868 --> 06:09:25.878 align:start position:0%
where the child lives would be
 
06:09:28.548 --> 06:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
responsible for for those sped Services
 
06:09:30.430 --> 06:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
she very clear about that but also
 
06:09:32.510 --> 06:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
remodeling the room so that child can
 
06:09:34.590 --> 06:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
function in the receiving School Maybe
 
06:09:36.830 --> 06:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
not maybe not I don't think we got a
 
06:09:38.310 --> 06:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
total answer to that and that really
 
06:09:40.830 --> 06:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
concerns me there's a lot of physical
 
06:09:43.230 --> 06:09:43.240 align:start position:0%
therapy stuff that
 
06:09:46.390 --> 06:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
requires devices from the roof mats the
 
06:09:49.990 --> 06:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
whole nine yards and if you have a child
 
06:09:51.548 --> 06:09:51.558 align:start position:0%
like that come in and if you're a small
 
06:09:52.868 --> 06:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
school you're not going to be able to
 
06:09:52.878 --> 06:09:55.390 align:start position:0%
school you're not going to be able to
afford

06:09:55.390 --> 06:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:57.190 --> 06:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
it so
 
06:10:00.628 --> 06:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
there I think this has wonderful
 
06:10:03.430 --> 06:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
intent and it used to be done between
 
06:10:05.390 --> 06:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
superintendent working it out with each
 
06:10:07.350 --> 06:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
other and there were these mutual
 
06:10:09.868 --> 06:10:09.878 align:start position:0%
agreements but now it we're stepping up
 
06:10:12.270 --> 06:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
a whole Notch here and there's all these
 
06:10:14.310 --> 06:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
issues that we got to consider and I
 
06:10:17.390 --> 06:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if it should be going forward
 
06:10:19.910 --> 06:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
without those answers specific those
 
06:10:24.310 --> 06:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
questions specifically answered and um
 
06:10:26.390 --> 06:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's a cause and result these results I
 
06:10:28.350 --> 06:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
don't know if we're going to be able to
 
06:10:31.150 --> 06:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
clarify them today great great idea but
 
06:10:32.628 --> 06:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
06:10:36.110 --> 06:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
know yeah yeah the the U part about
 
06:10:37.670 --> 06:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
special education is in the funding
 
06:10:43.270 --> 06:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:45.628 --> 06:10:45.638 align:start position:0%
it's it already deals with special
 
06:10:48.190 --> 06:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
education children with disabilities
 
06:10:50.350 --> 06:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
that are they're going to modify the
 
06:10:52.190 --> 06:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
building then that they're going to well
 
06:10:53.990 --> 06:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
I guess maybe we should ask some of the
 
06:10:56.390 --> 06:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
Stu the districts that that work on that
 
06:10:58.590 --> 06:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
and see how they do it obviously it's
 
06:11:01.830 --> 06:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
working it's done it works so I'm just
 
06:11:04.270 --> 06:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
saying I can't specify every district
 
06:11:06.510 --> 06:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
and everything that's coming up but if a
 
06:11:08.350 --> 06:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
if it's a bargaining chip thing
 
06:11:11.030 --> 06:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
obviously um districts think that this
 
06:11:11.040 --> 06:11:12.110 align:start position:0%
obviously um districts think that this
can

06:11:12.110 --> 06:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:11:14.510 --> 06:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
work well there are some severe
 
06:11:16.390 --> 06:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
handicapping conditions when the
 
06:11:18.868 --> 06:11:18.878 align:start position:0%
receiving school doesn't have the staff
 
06:11:21.510 --> 06:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the facility the
 
06:11:24.190 --> 06:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
room and there's a whole lot of other i'
 
06:11:26.070 --> 06:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
I've been involved with that sure but
 
06:11:28.190 --> 06:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
you can't if they need additional sha
 
06:11:30.670 --> 06:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
staff that's a way a district can say we
 
06:11:33.350 --> 06:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
don't we're not equipped not equipped so
 
06:11:35.070 --> 06:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
now you're rejecting a student because
 
06:11:36.350 --> 06:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
of their
 
06:11:38.830 --> 06:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
disability so then there law barking
 
06:11:44.350 --> 06:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:47.110 --> 06:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
staff this is opening up Pandora's Box
 
06:11:48.750 --> 06:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
well you're coming up with a lot of lot
 
06:11:51.070 --> 06:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
of questions that I'm sure that there
 
06:11:53.990 --> 06:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
are answers for because it wouldn't be
 
06:11:56.150 --> 06:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
offered if these were unanswerable
 
06:11:56.160 --> 06:11:58.030 align:start position:0%
offered if these were unanswerable
questions

06:11:58.030 --> 06:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:12:00.350 --> 06:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli I would just say it's
 
06:12:02.708 --> 06:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
it's not only working in parts of New
 
06:12:04.548 --> 06:12:04.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it's working in many
 
06:12:09.070 --> 06:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:14.150 --> 06:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:17.670 --> 06:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
this okay we have a motion on the floor
