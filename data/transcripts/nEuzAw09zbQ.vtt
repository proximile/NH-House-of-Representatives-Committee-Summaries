00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion sure
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair on uh
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
hospital 1280
 
00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:32.870 align:start position:0%
hospital 1280
uh

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.669 align:start position:0%
uh
it's

00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
plural the apparent decision there are
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
often times when parents don't agree
 
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.630 align:start position:0%
often times when parents don't agree
um

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure how that would be
 
00:27:46.399 --> 00:27:47.750 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure how that would be
handled

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
handled
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
and then the last line on line 12 has
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
the ultimate decision regarding the
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
health care of children resides with
 
00:27:54.399 --> 00:27:55.750 align:start position:0%
health care of children resides with
parents

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
although i agree with that
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
what we currently have
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
with respect to a divorce family
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.950 align:start position:0%
 
responsibility

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
that this would change it to both
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
parents ultimate decision
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
on health care
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
so for that reason i'm i'm
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative long yo keller
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
sure madam chair
 
00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:39.110 align:start position:0%
sure madam chair
um

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
listen this is my first day
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
you gotta give me a break here
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
00:28:45.919 --> 00:28:46.710 align:start position:0%
it's um
so

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
really what we're
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
this is really only limited to the
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights and so
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
it's only going to come up
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
in those hearings and
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
um so i
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
i did think that
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
um we had testimony that there was
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
someone that was you know maybe it was i
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
believe back in the 90s according to the
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
person that i talked to um that had some
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
their kids taken and put in foster care
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if they were eventually um
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
terminated uh they didn't actually say
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
that but
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
um that was definitely concerning to me
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
um i definitely don't want this to
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
happen and so even if it is not the
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
current practice i'd still be
 
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.110 align:start position:0%
current practice i'd still be
um

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.789 align:start position:0%
um
supporting

00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
making sure it doesn't happen in the
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yokela any
 
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
madam chairman i'm uh i'm puzzled
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
my colleague could
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
explain this to me a little more um he
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
refers to something that he had heard
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
that might or may not have happened in
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
the past
 
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.590 align:start position:0%
the past
and

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
that usually is not the most reliable
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
information on which we should base
 
00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.350 align:start position:0%
information on which we should base
decisions

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
that i i've served on very briefly at
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
one point
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
but i have followed its work and the
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
committee has been
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
unbelievably careful
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
over the years of
 
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.110 align:start position:0%
over the years of
recognizing

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
recognizing
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
the rights of parents
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
in an intact marriage
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
balancing the rights of parents when
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
marriages are no longer intact
 
00:30:58.159 --> 00:30:59.190 align:start position:0%
marriages are no longer intact
and

00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.430 align:start position:0%
 
balance

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
balance
 
00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
the incredibly the importance of the
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
rights of parents with obligations to
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
protect the well-being of the child
 
00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.430 align:start position:0%
protect the well-being of the child
and

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
i've read the bill um i had been told
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
that there might be an amendment and i
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
was hopeful that there would be one but
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
there isn't and
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
based on the way the bill is written um
 
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
i think it undoes
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of the work that this committee
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
has has worked on so consistently over
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
the years
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
and i would hope that um
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
absent an amendment
 
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
that the committee
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
might consider
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
voting down the i t the otp motion and
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps instead going i'm sorry i'll
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
wait till you can
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
listen to me i'm sorry we are listening
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
to you
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
to the point where representative you
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
yokela has something to suggest
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
in uh maybe helping you
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh with your concerns i thank you what i
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
wish if i could just finish my sentence
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
what i was sure suggests it's that
 
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.110 align:start position:0%
what i was sure suggests it's that
perhaps

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
it might be appropriate at this time
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
for this bill to be referred to interim
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
studies so that it can
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
in fact honor the
 
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
long-time commitment of children and
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
family and also addressed what
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
could be viewed as a specific problem
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair

in in regards to the um
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
the testimony that was brought to the
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee it was um
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
brought by a former uh employee of the
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
state and so

um i have no reason to believe that her
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
experience in that was was um
 
00:33:17.679 --> 00:33:19.029 align:start position:0%
experience in that was was um
mistaken

00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
mistaken
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
um and i also
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
um do
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
remember mentioning um
 
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.830 align:start position:0%
remember mentioning um
that

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.190 align:start position:0%
that
i

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
would be open to an amendment on this um
 
00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.950 align:start position:0%
would be open to an amendment on this um
specifically

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
removing the
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
as the ultimate decision regarding the
 
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
health care of the children resides with
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
the parents crossing that section of the
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
of the bill out and just saying a a
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
parent's decision to not have their
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
child vaccinated pursuant to an order of
 
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
the state or federal government or
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
agency or person of the same shall not
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
be grounds for termination of parental
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
might that address some of the concerns
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
that you
 
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.549 align:start position:0%
that you
raised

00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
raised
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much for the
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
courtesy um representative
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
whether it addresses or not is
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
irrelevant since my understanding is the
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
deadline on this bill um
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
would require us to vote on it now and
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
if it if it was the will of the the
 
00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:41.190 align:start position:0%
if it if it was the will of the the
committee

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair i i mean i
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
would be more comfortable with
 
00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.190 align:start position:0%
would be more comfortable with
that

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.310 align:start position:0%
that
deletion

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:56.069 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
and i guess i could be okay with the
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
rest of the language although
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's going to be it's going to
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
be a court decision if both parents
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
don't agree with something
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
and we know how that works out
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
somebody's not happy and they come here
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
and let us know about it
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
but um but yeah i i i
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
having that last sentence
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
deleted would be helpful for me
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
would that bring
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
you to
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
agree with the ought to pass motion
 
00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.829 align:start position:0%
agree with the ought to pass motion
representative

00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.349 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know what do you guys think
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
no no i guess not i guess not
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh representative
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
keller um i just wonder if um the
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
correction or the the amendment would
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
still be of enough value that we
 
00:35:53.119 --> 00:35:55.670 align:start position:0%
still be of enough value that we
um

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.829 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
postponed um until an amendment get
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
drafted later in this day that uh
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
that it be of enough value that we that
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
we not vote on it at this very moment
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
and wait for that amendment to be
 
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.910 align:start position:0%
and wait for that amendment to be
drafted

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
or do you think that we should just move
 
00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.630 align:start position:0%
or do you think that we should just move
forward

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:14.950 align:start position:0%
and and
um

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
maybe do a floor amendment or something
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
is it true representative long that it's
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
not going to change your
 
00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:25.670 align:start position:0%
not going to change your
motion

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
yes that's
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
that would be the truth
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
well with that said representative
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
yokela before i ask representative chase
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
for her question
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
if you want to make the amendment we can
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
do that if that amendment is important
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
to you
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
however it seems un
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
it seems that it's not going to change
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
in the i mean if you want to recognize
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
in the event of a expediency i think i
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
will um
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
just propose that amendment as a floor
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
amendment instead and so that i think
 
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
because i actually do think that the
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
changes of value so
 
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.750 align:start position:0%
changes of value so
um

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
so for that reason i i want it but i
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to hold up the committee
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i agree with
 
00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.270 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i agree with
you

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
but i do want to hear representative
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
actually it was more on the hearsay when
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
it might have been answered about
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
children being taken away from
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
parents because that they were not
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
going to vaccinate them
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
i didn't get to hear the whole testimony
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
i did listen
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
but um how how often does this happen
 
00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.270 align:start position:0%
but um how how often does this happen
and

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
why was the concern of bringing this
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
bill forward just quick in a nutshell so
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
i can understand my vote thank you
 
00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.710 align:start position:0%
i can understand my vote thank you
um

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
according to the records it's happened
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
more than once and as far as
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that's too many times
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.510 align:start position:0%

the
uh

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill actually brought us
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
information that said that the supreme
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
court already interpreted the current
 
00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.630 align:start position:0%
court already interpreted the current
language

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.430 align:start position:0%
language
um

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
the way that she's planning to change it
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
so that it could be interpreted that
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
same way
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
um the supreme court has already issued
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
guidance to all of the courts to that
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
this is how it should be interpreted and
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
so this change is
 
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.710 align:start position:0%
so this change is
not

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
i saw representative all schiller's hand
 
00:42:56.079 --> 00:42:59.030 align:start position:0%
i saw representative all schiller's hand
first

00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
i am
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
i don't remember that particular bit of
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh testimony from the prime sponsor
 
00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.870 align:start position:0%
uh testimony from the prime sponsor
however

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
what i do know from having spoken with
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor is that there is
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
um a desire to have the legislation
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
match um and guide
 
00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.790 align:start position:0%
match um and guide
future

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.750 align:start position:0%
future
um

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
future orders coming from the court
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
and this change of any of to only
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
actually provides a specific set of
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
bumpers if you will to keep
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
the decision
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
for modifying permanent orders
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
within a particular lane and to not
 
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
offer spaces for it to go left right and
 
00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:49.750 align:start position:0%
offer spaces for it to go left right and
sideways

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
sideways
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
so this was actually like a very very
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
specific ask to keep judicial constraint
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
within a specific lane
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
so i feel like it is incredibly
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative although
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative long you had
 
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.829 align:start position:0%
representative long you had
representatives

00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
marjorie smith
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you actually that was the point
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
that i was going to make that we have
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
over the years many times
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
we act as legislators we pass laws
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
face cases involving those laws they see
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
areas where perhaps we could
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
fine-tune the language in order to make
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
sure that intentions are clear in the
 
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.190 align:start position:0%
sure that intentions are clear in the
future

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.870 align:start position:0%
future
and

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
the usual procedure is to
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
evaluate that and
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
and agree and so i would have i was
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
delighted at the initial
 
00:44:53.119 --> 00:44:54.309 align:start position:0%
delighted at the initial
motion

00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:44:54.319 --> 00:44:55.430 align:start position:0%
motion
um

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
made a lot of sense and
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
now i'm confused
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative yokela
 
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so the supreme
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
court doesn't actually make laws they
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
just interpret it and so there was um
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
at some point there was a confusion
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
about the correct way to interpret it
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
but the supreme court clarified that
 
00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:23.910 align:start position:0%
but the supreme court clarified that
that

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
the correct way to interpret it is
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
that the list is limited and so
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
clarifying the language further
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
um just opens up to a new interpretation
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
by the supreme court of the language
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
invites a lawsuit so i don't i don't
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
think so
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't agree so thank you matt
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
chair thank you
 
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.000 align:start position:0%

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
i did for my attention

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
exceed my authority
 
00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.710 align:start position:0%
exceed my authority
but

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
i listened to my colleague speak and
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
supports

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
supports
 
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.710 align:start position:0%
supports
um

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
his initial
 
00:46:30.079 --> 00:46:31.109 align:start position:0%
his initial
uh

00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
his initial motion and that is in fact
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
the you know we make the laws
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
the court looks at them
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
the court doesn't make the laws but they
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
say we're there there's a need to
 
00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.950 align:start position:0%
say we're there there's a need to
clarify

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
that should be
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
the legislators responsibility
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
so that we can clarify and put in place
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
what we want and i know that sometimes
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
we get attached to one bill or another i
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
certainly have over the years
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
but or one position or another but i
 
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.109 align:start position:0%
but or one position or another but i
think

00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
his initial instinct was right and i'd
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
like to go back to that first motion at
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
some point thank you
 
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your suggestion
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
representative altschiller thank you
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair um
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
i'd like to um
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
i'd like to say that representative
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
yokela's initial motion was right on the
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
money because um
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
as you said it's the supreme it's the
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
court it's the judicial
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
judicial grants branches responsibility
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
to interpret
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
the laws
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
and when the judicial branch sees that
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
there are is confusion it it is often
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
and regularly brought before us
 
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.390 align:start position:0%
and regularly brought before us
to

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
clean up to clarify
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
and to
 
00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.150 align:start position:0%
and to
fine-tune

00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
fine-tune
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
spaces where in the law has question
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
so while the supreme court may
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
have ruled in a space that
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps in one representative's opinion
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
makes this moot
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
um i would say that it would do no harm
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
for your argument to
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
make the motion of ought to pass so that
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
the clarification
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
to to make sure that we don't have to do
 
00:48:34.079 --> 00:48:35.430 align:start position:0%
to to make sure that we don't have to do
exactly

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
what the courts have asked us to do
 
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
which is often clarify
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
consolidate and make more concise
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
the intent
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
of the law so
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
we're all on the same page i think i
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
think we're all on the same page and um
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you respectfully would ask for a
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
withdrawal of your motion
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
um of itl to otp so we can all be on the
 
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
same page together thank you
 
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.390 align:start position:0%
 
in

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes when we write laws they are
 
00:49:17.599 --> 00:49:18.710 align:start position:0%
sometimes when we write laws they are
vague

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
vague
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
the question goes to the supreme court
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
for clarification
 
00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:25.670 align:start position:0%
for clarification
and

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes the courts
 
00:49:27.839 --> 00:49:28.790 align:start position:0%
sometimes the courts
do

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
rule in such a way that they do not
 
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.109 align:start position:0%
rule in such a way that they do not
um

00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
that the legislature
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
they rule in such a way that
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature may not agree
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
with their ruling and therefore the
 
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
legislation comes to clarify the
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
language so that
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
that that ruling
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
um which the legislature believes is
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
incorrect couldn't be clarified and be
 
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
pointed in the in the correct direction
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
but in this case
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature said what they thought
 
00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.630 align:start position:0%
the legislature said what they thought
was

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
the the um or they made the law
 
00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.430 align:start position:0%
the the um or they made the law
then

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.230 align:start position:0%
then
a

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
lower court
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
interpreted in one way and the supreme
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
court says no you're wrong that this is
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
the correct way and that is the way that
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
that this bill is proposed and so
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
there is no there was once confusion
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
by a lower court but there's no longer
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
any confusion that it is a limited list
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
by both what we've said in the law
 
00:50:32.559 --> 00:50:33.670 align:start position:0%
by both what we've said in the law
currently

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
and what the supreme court interpreted
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
our language to be
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
so there is
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
so this law
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
is just um
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
not necessary in the sense that it's
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
already been clarified
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
and so i agree that it the purpose
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
whether we pass this bill or we don't
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
pass this bill the policy is the exact
 
00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.230 align:start position:0%
pass this bill the policy is the exact
same

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
for the for the state of new hampshire
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that um in a time that
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
we're having a uh you know uh overflow
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
of bills
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
that we need to
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
pass laws or have additional hearings
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
about laws that are not actually going
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
to change policy in new hampshire
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%

yes i i uh agree with this bill that
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
that temporary alimony should be
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
calculated the same way as
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
regular alimony i'm not sure why there
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
is ever a difference and um
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.430 align:start position:0%
i think that
um

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
the time
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
pay spent paying the alimony should
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
count towards the time being spent
 
00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:17.109 align:start position:0%
count towards the time being spent
uh

00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
allowed for the total amount time uh
 
00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:21.109 align:start position:0%
allowed for the total amount time uh
spending

00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
spending
 
00:54:21.119 --> 00:54:21.990 align:start position:0%
spending
uh

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
paying alimony so i think that this is
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%

00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
i think this opens up
 
00:55:06.559 --> 00:55:07.829 align:start position:0%
i think this opens up
um

00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
i mean the alimony has only been placed
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh within the past i want to say
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
five years maybe four years
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
i don't have i printed out an email i
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
don't have it on me uh so
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
so i think changing it it's it's my
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that's been working i
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
i was here
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
for the testimony and they're they're
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
just the introduction from
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative d simone
 
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:39.270 align:start position:0%
representative d simone
um

00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know where this helps
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
and i think it has the potential to uh
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
hurt with respect to temporary
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know somebody
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know if this if this addresses
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh when somebody
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
is getting alimony and goes into a
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
relationship or gets a remarried
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
ends up in a divorce
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
comes back
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
after six months and they still have
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
three years of the prior alimony
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh would that kick in are those
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
addressed are those addressed in this
 
00:56:17.359 --> 00:56:22.870 align:start position:0%
addressed are those addressed in this
belt

00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
um i don't believe that they are within
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
the scope of this bill and um i i just
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
wonder why we have the calculation the
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
normal calculation for alimony and then
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
an additional
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh temporary calculation which does not
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
need to use the normal calculation
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
like what what is the purpose of having
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
the calcul like why can't they just use
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
and that would have that was the purpose
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
for the bill
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%

01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative keller would you like to
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:01:06.309 --> 01:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
this amendment just
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
wipes out the entire
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
bill and replaces it with
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
a definition of shared parenting
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
where each parent plays substantially
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
equal role in decision making and 35
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
percent or more of the child's
 
01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
residential time is spent with each
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
parent and then it also
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
places inside of the parental rights and
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities where
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
under section
 
01:01:35.119 --> 01:01:35.910 align:start position:0%
under section
i

01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
dash a
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
there is a um
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
a section that reads that if the court
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
concludes that frequent and continuing
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
contact between each child and both
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
parents is not in the best interest of
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
the child the court shall make finding
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
supporting that order and so
 
01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.030 align:start position:0%
supporting that order and so
um

01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
all we're doing is adding the language
 
01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
that if the court doesn't make that
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
conclusion that there should be a
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
presumption that shared parenting is in
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child so there
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
is still um
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
kind of judicial leeway as far as um one
 
01:02:11.599 --> 01:02:12.789 align:start position:0%
kind of judicial leeway as far as um one
deciding

01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
deciding
 
01:02:12.799 --> 01:02:13.829 align:start position:0%
deciding
that

01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:13.839 --> 01:02:15.109 align:start position:0%
that
uh

01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:15.119 --> 01:02:16.309 align:start position:0%
uh
the

01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
contact between both parents is not in
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
their best interest
 
01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.549 align:start position:0%
their best interest
and

01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
um you know even in the current uh law
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
right now we
 
01:02:25.599 --> 01:02:26.390 align:start position:0%
right now we
we

01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
already recognize that that
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
contact if if the you know there's no
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
harm to the child in doing so that
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
contact between both parents
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
um is best and all that and a bunch of
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
research that i'm aware of suggest that
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
that is best for the um
 
01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
the social and emotional
 
01:02:49.839 --> 01:02:51.510 align:start position:0%
the social and emotional
um

01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
relationships uh
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
that that child
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:02:56.799 --> 01:02:57.829 align:start position:0%
that uh
forms

01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
forms
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
in their in their youth is is beneficial
 
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
by contact with both parents if they're
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
not harming their ch
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
child and so i believe that this makes
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
it clear that um
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
that the the court can still say that
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's not the best interest of the child
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
if there's if there's reason to but
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise we should try and um
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
move towards
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
both parents being uh
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
a significant part of that child's life
 
01:03:25.039 --> 01:03:25.910 align:start position:0%
a significant part of that child's life
so

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:26.950 align:start position:0%
so
i

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh hope that you will support this this
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
thank you any discussion sure
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so so
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
although i do agree with the
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative that both parents are the
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
best case scenario
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh that's not often the reality
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh the current customized parenting
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
schedule approach appears that will be
 
01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:51.670 align:start position:0%
schedule approach appears that will be
gone

01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
gone
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
and this is important where there's more
 
01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
than two children involved because there
 
01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
may be
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
a parental schedule that suits one and
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
may not suit the other
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
i i think this is rigid as far as the
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
scheduling goes it's
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh i know
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
i know you also say if the court does
 
01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
not make that conclusion so the court
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
would have to make that conclusion
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
that they could put it back to a
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
customized um
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
to a current scheduling
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
that is current is that
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.150 align:start position:0%
thank you um
i

01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.670 align:start position:0%
i
um

01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
so currently they're already making that
 
01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:48.799 align:start position:0%
determination this is already in law
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
right where they can determine that um
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
that the child should not be with one of
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
the the um the language added is just
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
that there shall be a presumption
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
obviously if there is evidence that that
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
is not the case then
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
the presumption would be overturned
 
01:05:09.119 --> 01:05:11.990 align:start position:0%
the presumption would be overturned
right

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
so follow up for me
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
so what what changes the court needs the
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
judge needs to put in writing
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
or something to where i mean i'm trying
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
to figure out what what changes with
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
this being passed
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't appear that anything's
 
01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.230 align:start position:0%
it doesn't appear that anything's
changed

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yokela thank
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
you for the question um
 
01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.390 align:start position:0%
so the
[Music]

01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.069 align:start position:0%
[Music]
the

01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
the change is if they don't believe that
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to be harmful to the kid to
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
have relationships with both parents
 
01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
that their starting point
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
should be that they have relationships
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
with both kids in a significant amount
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
of time and not just like one day every
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
month or you know one weekend a month
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
kind of a thing it would be more
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
substantial than that unless they have
 
01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.109 align:start position:0%
substantial than that unless they have
reason

01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:06:09.119 --> 01:06:10.549 align:start position:0%
reason
to

01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
say otherwise
 
01:06:12.319 --> 01:06:13.510 align:start position:0%
say otherwise
okay

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative altschiller
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
my deep concern
 
01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.910 align:start position:0%
my deep concern
in

01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
my deep concern is that this is a um
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
this this is a
 
01:06:40.319 --> 01:06:41.990 align:start position:0%
this this is a
very

01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
subtle but impactful
 
01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.549 align:start position:0%
subtle but impactful
impactful

01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
impactful
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
place um where
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
this is not about the best interests of
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
the child but the best interests of the
 
01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:56.069 align:start position:0%
the child but the best interests of the
parents

01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm very concerned
 
01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:02.150 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm very concerned
that

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.829 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
families that experience domestic
 
01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.589 align:start position:0%
families that experience domestic
violence

01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
violence
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
that this
 
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
creates a space
 
01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.870 align:start position:0%
creates a space
that

01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
there is a presumption that shared
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
parenting is in the best interest of the
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
child and we know
 
01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:20.069 align:start position:0%
child and we know
from

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
court decisions that have been made that
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
decisions that affect
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
to adults relationships
 
01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:29.829 align:start position:0%
to adults relationships
often

01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%

01:07:29.839 --> 01:07:31.829 align:start position:0%
often
often

01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
often
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
hurt the children involved
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
creates a space where the parents
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
um conflicts
 
01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
will take precedence over the best
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
interests of the child i don't see a
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
carve out i don't see any
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement that um that this is
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
about the children it says mostly this
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
is mostly about the rights of
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
of parents and not about
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
the the best interest of the child
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
so if
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
representative yoko if you could explain
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%

in the spaces where domestic violence
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
happens um

01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
significant way

01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
we we've heard
 
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
testimony and received documents with
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
respect to um
 
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
the court will will say that element
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
um that um child support is owed at a
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a week
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh effective uh 11
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
11 1
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
and then we're hearing of
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
people receiving the support not
 
01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
receiving the support
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
and taking not receiving the support for
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
two or three or sometimes four weeks
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
until they go back to court
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
because the person that's supposed to be
 
01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.149 align:start position:0%
because the person that's supposed to be
paying

01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
paying
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
says it wasn't defined
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
when i'm supposed to pay i was supposed
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
to pay november first and that's all i
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
paid uh it doesn't say i got to pay
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
every week after
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
uh i mean
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's the fact that's happening now so
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
this is a simple fix
 
01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
that when the judge makes the decision
 
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
put in the payment schedule
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
every every beginning of the week
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
effective november 1st
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
or or what have you that is currently
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
going on now that people are supposed to
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
be receiving this child support are not
 
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
receiving it they're waiting to go back
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
to court to get the judge to give a
 
01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:29.830 align:start position:0%
to court to get the judge to give a
schedule

01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
and that's hurting people that ought to
 
01:16:32.159 --> 01:16:33.030 align:start position:0%
and that's hurting people that ought to
be

01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
receiving their child support in a
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry thank you any further
 
01:16:42.719 --> 01:16:44.070 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry thank you any further

01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair and
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative long i think you know my
 
01:16:50.159 --> 01:16:51.430 align:start position:0%
representative long i think you know my
ex-husband

01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
ex-husband
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
so this is a perfect
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
this is great because that was always
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
the the clarification so i'm going to
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
agree with this this i thought i'd like
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
this bill i think it's
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
clarifies exactly when there are some
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
many good good parents out there who pay
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
and take care of their children but
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
there are also those others that well it
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't said and i'm going to pay when i
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
want to or you're going to have to keep
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
dragging me back to court
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
that is a real issue with child care
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
while you have to go to court to try to
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
get the little bit of money that's
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to be paying for these kids and
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
my own personal experience i love this i
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
think it's a great bill thank you
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative al shiller
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
i at the risk
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
of dating myself a little bit
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
used to be a time when you would make a
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
purchase take out a loan have a
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility that came along
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
with it a set of stubs that you would
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
fill in the date write a check stick
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
that stub in it had it had a number on
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
it that would refer to the payment that
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
you owed in whatever venue it was and we
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
don't do that anymore
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
however uh particularly it would be
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
super helpful in the courts because we
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
heard testimony and we know
 
01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:09.910 align:start position:0%
heard testimony and we know
that

01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
without very clear and explicit
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
instructions we have a significant
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
number of granite staters who
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
will look for any and all loopholes to
 
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
not pay
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
what they owe
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
for their child support so um this would
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
give a specific
 
01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
time frame that child support is due on
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
a specific date
 
01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
um and when it doesn't come through that
 
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
gives the person who is supposed to be
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
getting that child support to pay for
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
those children an opportunity to go to
 
01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:46.950 align:start position:0%
those children an opportunity to go to
court

01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
and say a deadline has been missed
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
without having to get involved with all
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
the nonsense that is happening right now
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
with people who are supposed to be
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
paying saying well it wasn't really
 
01:19:00.159 --> 01:19:01.430 align:start position:0%
paying saying well it wasn't really
clear

01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
we couldn't be more clear if we just put
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
in a payment schedule thank you
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
representative ocala
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for recognizing
 
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
me um
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
i agree that it is a good practice
 
01:19:17.199 --> 01:19:18.390 align:start position:0%
i agree that it is a good practice
um

01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:19.189 align:start position:0%
um
i

01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
however have concerns that one
 
01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:26.310 align:start position:0%
however have concerns that one
that

01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
if someone's situation is
 
01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.470 align:start position:0%
if someone's situation is
fluid

01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
fluid
 
01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:33.669 align:start position:0%
fluid
they're

01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
they may be
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
looking for a job or in between jobs
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
that payment
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
let's say on the 15th and the 30th of
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
the month may not be appropriate in the
 
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
new situation and
 
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
the courts may have to hear
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
a case to try and change the due date
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
and so i believe that while it's good
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
practice there's nothing barring the
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
courts from doing
 
01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
this now
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
by saying that and it leaves all open
 
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
the option for them to not specify it
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
it that specifying it would only create
 
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
more work for them in the future so
 
01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.229 align:start position:0%
more work for them in the future so
i

01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:20:22.629 --> 01:20:22.639 align:start position:0%
agree that it's good practice
 
01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure that legislating it is
 
01:20:27.669 --> 01:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
the best solution
 
01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:28.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%

01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
bank expects that you make your payment
 
01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not you can pay
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
and really child support is much more
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
important than making monthly car
 
01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.350 align:start position:0%
important than making monthly car
payments

01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
so that's just my two cents on that
 
01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.870 align:start position:0%
so that's just my two cents on that
matter

01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
matter
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative long
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh if you lose your job or you just got
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
your wages knocked down you notify the
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
court so that you notify the court right
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
away so the court knows that why this
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
payment didn't come in
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh and also uh
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
you know again we're looking at the i
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
you know i'm getting mixed messages just
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
the world according to me or this
 
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
committee according to me
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
um judges discretion which some bills we
 
01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely do not want the judges to
 
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
have the discretion and then some bills
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
well leave it up to the judge's
 
01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.310 align:start position:0%
well leave it up to the judge's
discretion

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
um you know so
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
you know and i think
 
01:21:44.629 --> 01:21:44.639 align:start position:0%
the court system i've heard this before
 
01:21:44.639 --> 01:21:47.270 align:start position:0%
the court system i've heard this before
probably

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh when they came before us an
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
organizational day that they preferred
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
that the legislation be clear
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
you know that that's what they prefer
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
because it's you know and it makes sense
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
to me if i'm a judge
 
01:22:00.719 --> 01:22:01.510 align:start position:0%
to me if i'm a judge
which

01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
i don't qualify whatsoever but if i was
 
01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:06.639 align:start position:0%
i would like to be clearer with with
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
legislation and not having it
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
interpreted so
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know in this case to having the
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
judge's discretion i i
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
this is a simple
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
why not you know
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
why not make it statutory
 
01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.790 align:start position:0%
why not make it statutory
required

01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative bellinger
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
and then representative smith
 
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair for recognizing
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
me i think one of the things that i've
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
recognized in this committee is that
 
01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:36.639 align:start position:0%
we hear all sorts of situations when it
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
comes to child support there's there's
 
01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:39.270 align:start position:0%
comes to child support there's there's
no

01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
when

01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
the issue that i have
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
these things should be worked out in the
 
01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
courtroom it shouldn't be a requirement
 
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
that you have to pay it on this day at
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
this time
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
it should be a payment
 
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
i think this bill is just
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
not the best
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
and i think it can be done a little bit
 
01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.830 align:start position:0%
and i think it can be done a little bit
better

01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
which is why i support the itl motion
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
i cannot tell you how much i am
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
valuing my experience here with this
 
01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
committee today because
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
i learned so much from seeing how other
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
committees function
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
but i have to admit that i'm confused
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
again going back to something that
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
representative outsole said i'm old
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
enough to remember a song that said
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
first you say you do and then you don't
 
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
first you say you will and then you
 
01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.430 align:start position:0%
first you say you will and then you
won't

01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
won't
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
and what i hear is agreement about the
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
importance of child support
 
01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:57.950 align:start position:0%
importance of child support
the

01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
importance of
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
of having a court make a reasonable
 
01:24:08.229 --> 01:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
rational decision
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
about how that child support should be
 
01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.390 align:start position:0%
about how that child support should be
paid

01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
paid
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
and then the music stops because then
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
what i hear is
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
someone or another saying well yes the
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
court makes the decision and they say it
 
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
should be paid every week or every two
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
weeks or every month and it should be
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
this much
 
01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.870 align:start position:0%
this much
but

01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
if that's not what happens so it's
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
what doesn't happen
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
requiring then
 
01:24:40.719 --> 01:24:41.750 align:start position:0%
requiring then
the

01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
aggrieved parent to go back to court
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
and to start all over again and
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
if we all agree that
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
i mean i won't tell you my principle
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
that nobody in the world should be
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to have children unless i agreed
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
that they in fact would be good parents
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to let that one go i mean
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
you know just for the moment i'm going
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
to let that one go
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
but things happen and marriages break up
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
after children have arrived on the scene
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
the state has a responsibility for the
 
01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
well-being of those children and we have
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
a court system
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
to enforce that and when the court says
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
a b and c
 
01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
that ought to be the rule and if
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances change and they do people
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
lose a job or they get a job that's
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
going to require them to move out of
 
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
state or all kinds of other things
 
01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.430 align:start position:0%
state or all kinds of other things
happen

01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
you then can go back to court and say
 
01:25:41.679 --> 01:25:43.390 align:start position:0%
you then can go back to court and say
please

01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:45.270 align:start position:0%
please
revisit

01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
revisit
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
the decision because the circumstances
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
have changed
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
and if the circumstances haven't changed
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
well then you ought to follow the court
 
01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
and on this one again i hope
 
01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:01.990 align:start position:0%
and on this one again i hope
that

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
i i'm i'm so upset
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
i'm always upset when i see partisan
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
votes i just don't see things in a
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
partisan way i never ran a committee's
 
01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.030 align:start position:0%
partisan way i never ran a committee's
partisan

01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
partisan
 
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
and i see people
 
01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
questioning things that are said but
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
still voting in a way that they think
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
maybe they're expected to i'd like
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps this one to be a bill
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
since we have consensus of the
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
importance of supporting
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
children which is what child support is
 
01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:32.550 align:start position:0%
children which is what child support is
about

01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
that we recognize that we ought to make
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
it easy to be able to
 
01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
in to know what's expected and to have
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
expect people to follow what's expected
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
and so i hope we might
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
not accept the pending motion and in
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
fact recognize that this bill does what
 
01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
i think we all want to have happen thank
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
you madam
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative also thank you madam
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
chair my concern is i just feel like it
 
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
it reads as in the interest of the
 
01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.110 align:start position:0%
it reads as in the interest of the
parent

01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
parent
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
the parent that's supposed to pay
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
isn't able there's no schedule for for
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
your other parent to pay
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
therefore i can't schedule dinner today
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm having a hard time i apologize
 
01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.070 align:start position:0%
so i'm having a hard time i apologize
again

01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
we're all here for children
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
and it just feels like
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
we're making it comfortable
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
statement thank you okay thank you
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative alzheimer thank you very
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
much madam chair so i'm i think
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
i am also deeply uncomfortable
 
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
um because we have
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
we have rules and we have laws in the
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire about paying our
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
bills and paying them on time
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
and um if for instance you take out you
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
are you owe money on a car and you don't
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
pay that money on the car
 
01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
you can have that car taken away in less
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
than 90 days 90 days and there is firm
 
01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
action but if you don't pay your child
 
01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:23.830 align:start position:0%
action but if you don't pay your child
support

01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
you can be in arrears for more than a
 
01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.350 align:start position:0%
you can be in arrears for more than a
year

01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
you can be in arrears for over ten
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:28:35.430 --> 01:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
before the courts
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
take swift action and i would say that
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
one year is not necessarily
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
swift action
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
there are spaces where the court
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
can put a withholding
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
on a paycheck
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
and i will
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
i will i will say that i have worked
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
with parents
 
01:28:57.669 --> 01:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
for whom their
 
01:28:59.350 --> 01:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
the parent
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
of their the other parent of their child
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
specifically stays underemployed or
 
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
works for money under the table so
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to report and then
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
claims i don't have any money and also
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
they also don't have a schedule that
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
they have to pay on because their first
 
01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
payment was due on december 1st
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
and then it says nothing about
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
when the actual next payment is due so
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
we go through
 
01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:26.470 align:start position:0%
we go through
um

01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
the the parents who are paying for their
 
01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:30.390 align:start position:0%
the the parents who are paying for their
children's

01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
children's
 
01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
diapers and medicines and shoes and
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
are left twisting in the wind because we
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
have negligent parents who are using
 
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
these loopholes that we can just close
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
up super easy right now
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
to jump through which
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
no other
 
01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:52.470 align:start position:0%
no other
financial

01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:54.550 align:start position:0%
financial
obligation

01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
would allow for not one in this state so
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
i would hope that we can pass this to
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
protect the parents who are trying to
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
care for their children
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
they can't as representative alicea said
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
say we're just you know
 
01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have wi-fi i know you
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
have home school this week but we're not
 
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
having it because we don't have enough
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
money um thank you
 
01:30:22.639 --> 01:30:23.750 align:start position:0%
money um thank you
so

01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:24.870 align:start position:0%
so
yeah

01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative yokela
 
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
i believe the previous representative
 
01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.350 align:start position:0%
i believe the previous representative
hit

01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
hit
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
um the nail right on the head that the
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
problem isn't
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
that the courts
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
can or cannot or should or should not
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
put the due date in the system the
 
01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
problem is enforcement
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
and when enforcement
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
is happening and so i absolutely agree
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
that a bill which
 
01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:05.270 align:start position:0%
that a bill which
maybe

01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
does not allow
 
01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:07.669 align:start position:0%
does not allow
for

01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
a year of arrears and ten thousand
 
01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
dollars before we do anything about it
 
01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:14.310 align:start position:0%
dollars before we do anything about it
is

01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
to change that to a lower amount or 90
 
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
days or whatever i believe that is um
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
cutting right at the heart of this issue
 
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
whereas i don't believe it's actually
 
01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
the judge's fault
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
for lack of clarity that the payments
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
are not coming in
 
01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:34.229 align:start position:0%
are not coming in
but

01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
the i believe in fact that you kind of
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
have pointed out that the
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
their their hands are tied because
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:48.149 align:start position:0%
 
far

01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
far
 
01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
past when it should be enforced and so i
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
think that this is
 
01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:56.149 align:start position:0%
think that this is
not

01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
the solution
 
01:31:58.470 --> 01:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
i agree that uh
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
a bill addressing the the
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
the ability to go a year or ten thousand
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
dollars is something that
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
the legislature should address going
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%

to your right had mentioned something so
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
um the two previous speakers ago
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um you

payment company your bank might
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
repossess your car but one of the things
 
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
that you can do is contact the bank

01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
i need to postpone that payment
 
01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:17.030 align:start position:0%
i need to postpone that payment
so

01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not disagreeing that child care
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
payments should
 
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
we should close the loopholes i just i
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
agree with representative yokela when we
 
01:33:29.110 --> 01:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
say that the enforcement is the problem
 
01:33:31.669 --> 01:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
now if i have to pay my child care
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
payment on the 15th and have not
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
had it removed from my check by my
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
employer which as an employer i have an
 
01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
employee who does um have that withdrawn
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
because of that reason
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
and they're not doing their
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility to make sure that it's
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
being done which is their responsibility
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
to do but i can't make the payment on
 
01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
the 15th because i'm working paycheck to
 
01:33:54.639 --> 01:33:56.310 align:start position:0%
the 15th because i'm working paycheck to
paycheck

01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
paycheck
 
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
and i have to go and file every time
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
with the court just becomes a redundancy
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to go back to what the
 
01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
previous speaker said representative
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
ocala about the
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the problem and i just
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
again support this itl motion and i hope
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
we can all find a better solution as we
 
01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
continue to move forward through this
 
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
legislative session thank you
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
it just it's it is a step in the right
 
01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
direction i completely agree and
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
understand what everybody's saying i i
 
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
first handed went through this for years
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
with my children and having to drag my
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
ex-husband back to court i understand
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
how much more it cost me i know the fact
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
of not being able to do things for my
 
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
children because i didn't have the funds
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
because their father wasn't holding up
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
his end of the deal
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
all this is is just adding a
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
a structured payment plan so that person
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
says oh okay this is when i need to have
 
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
this done and it's written and i feel it
 
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
very strongly because i he had his wages
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
garnished as well
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
that i could have gone back into court
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
and just said here's the schedule and
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
this is what he's doing and this is what
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
he's missed and have him be held
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
accountable for it
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's so simple and i do agree about the
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
other changes in a loss i think that's
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
something that would be great for
 
01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
somebody to bring forward in the next
 
01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:21.590 align:start position:0%
somebody to bring forward in the next
session

01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
i just
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't see itling this at all thank you
 
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%

01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:29.360 align:start position:0%

01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
every month we have bills to pay and we
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
prioritize what's most important so i
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
have to decide whether or not i pay my
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
rent if i pay my cable if i pay for my
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%

01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
pay for should be my child
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
and so even though my circumstances may
 
01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
change for months a month in terms of my
 
01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:51.910 align:start position:0%
change for months a month in terms of my
income

01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
i still have all these bills to pay
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%

01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%

01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
eats that's my first responsibility my
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
cell phone that's secondary
 
01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:03.760 align:start position:0%

there was
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
definitely concern in my part that
 
01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
someone may
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%

uh
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
and then the person paying for that
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%

you know mentioned to that person
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
i thought that that was just going to
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
create additional tension and that you
 
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320 align:start position:0%

01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%

01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
you're on the way to getting treatment
 
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:33.280 align:start position:0%

01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
to um clean up what i and
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
i worked with this with representative

01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
nelson
 
01:46:07.199 --> 01:46:10.390 align:start position:0%
nelson
and

01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
we had some concerns with the language
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
that i'm sure were were apparent at the
 
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.030 align:start position:0%
that i'm sure were were apparent at the
hearing

01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
and um i believe
 
01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
some of those
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
um are bet were best um
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
served by uh kind of reducing the scope
 
01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:31.750 align:start position:0%
of this bill
um

01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:34.149 --> 01:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
because there was too many um
 
01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
too many issues to
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
try and get right all in one
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
shot and so
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
my hope is that reducing the issues make
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
this bill tighter and cleaner and
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
the conflicts
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
positive uh recommendation
 
01:47:00.239 --> 01:47:01.350 align:start position:0%
positive uh recommendation
and

01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:03.430 align:start position:0%
and
uh

01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
the main thing that uh
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
we wanted to do was to remove um
 
01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:13.030 align:start position:0%
we wanted to do was to remove um
the

01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:14.229 --> 01:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
the medical
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh languages because we've we believe
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
that that was um
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
that most of the testimony that we heard
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
about the issues in the state were
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
regarding actual schools
 
01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:27.510 align:start position:0%
regarding actual schools
and

01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:28.310 align:start position:0%
and
not

01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:29.270 align:start position:0%
not
not

01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
issues and so i believe that we have the
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
time to get the medical issues right
 
01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
before moving forward with that and
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
a concern of people being able to go to
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
jail or
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
so we were moved in the violation
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
yeah we removed the um
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
the class a misdemeanor to a class b
 
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor which does not have any um
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
jail penalty possibility
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
and also removed the
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
the teaching credentials for a year and
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
remove that to just
 
01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:26.470 --> 01:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
disciplinary letter in their personnel
 
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
for any uh teacher school employee or
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
administrator that violates the
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
provisions of this so
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
for the mo
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
and and also we clarified that the as
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
far as obtaining records
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
the record requests which should be
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
going to the superintendent
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
and they would be responding in 10
 
01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:56.550 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
that's actually longer i believe than
 
01:48:58.719 --> 01:48:59.590 align:start position:0%
that's actually longer i believe than
the

01:48:59.590 --> 01:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:01.109 align:start position:0%
the
91a

01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
91a
 
01:49:01.119 --> 01:49:02.390 align:start position:0%
91a
uh

01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
so that should not be a problem
 
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
i i'll
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
i think that hopefully
 
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll try and uh do more
 
01:49:16.709 --> 01:49:16.719 align:start position:0%
clarification if if uh it's needed thank
 
01:49:16.719 --> 01:49:20.070 align:start position:0%
clarification if if uh it's needed thank
you

01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you do i see any discussion
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
we had a good hearing i i listened and
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh the representative's absolutely
 
01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:37.189 align:start position:0%
uh the representative's absolutely
correct

01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:49:39.750 --> 01:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
i heard from all the testimony maybe one
 
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
sentence of health care the rest was on
 
01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:43.669 align:start position:0%
sentence of health care the rest was on
education

01:49:43.669 --> 01:49:43.679 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
um so i think
 
01:49:49.270 --> 01:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
in in my opinion i you know throughout
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
the hearing and
 
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
trying to swallow this
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
you know i'm thinking when were
 
01:49:58.709 --> 01:49:58.719 align:start position:0%
parental rights taken away
 
01:49:58.719 --> 01:49:59.750 align:start position:0%
parental rights taken away
i

01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
i keep having a hard time getting that
 
01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
i looked through some of the town
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
meeting warrants
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
these same issues are on warrants at our
 
01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:13.910 align:start position:0%
these same issues are on warrants at our
meetings

01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think that's the way to go
 
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
manchester for example all that they
 
01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
were looking for is on the website there
 
01:50:22.629 --> 01:50:22.639 align:start position:0%
are other municipalities that have that
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
on the website so it's not a state as a
 
01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:26.709 align:start position:0%
on the website so it's not a state as a
whole

01:50:26.709 --> 01:50:26.719 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:50:28.629 --> 01:50:28.639 align:start position:0%
uh you know every municipality in the
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
state as a whole that we're fixing here
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's specific to
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
it's specific to some districts that for
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
whatever reason aren't giving people
 
01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
what they ought to be given people that
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
is currently in statute when you look at
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you miss dwyer for
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
dyer for the uh
 
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
the side by side
 
01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:53.750 align:start position:0%
the side by side
so

01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what this is going to do
 
01:50:57.589 --> 01:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
putting it in statute again
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's going to be the same
 
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
issue and then i also have an issue with
 
01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:04.390 align:start position:0%
issue and then i also have an issue with
uh

01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
page 1 line 18
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
through 23 and then 25 to 26.
 
01:51:18.070 --> 01:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
as has a parent somebody put in a
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
complaint that my child was being uh
 
01:51:24.719 --> 01:51:26.390 align:start position:0%
complaint that my child was being uh
abused

01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
abused
 
01:51:29.589 --> 01:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
so dcyf comes to visit me
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
i don't allow him in because this is my
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
right i got parental rights this is my
 
01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:34.870 align:start position:0%
right i got parental rights this is my
right

01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
you prove to me that my child's being
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
abused even though the child is being
 
01:51:39.119 --> 01:51:40.709 align:start position:0%
abused even though the child is being
abused

01:51:40.709 --> 01:51:40.719 align:start position:0%
abused
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
you prove to me that there's abuse and
 
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
then you could take that child but right
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
now with these parental rights no you
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
can't you do the investigation and you
 
01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
show me where
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's abuse and then i'll
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh and then i'll comply if if i even
 
01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:57.910 align:start position:0%
uh and then i'll comply if if i even
will

01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
um so so i do have an issue with that so
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
i i think this is
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
with respect to the schools this is for
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
to decide
 
01:52:07.510 --> 01:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh and and
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
the infringement on parental rights
 
01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:10.550 align:start position:0%
the infringement on parental rights
prohibits

01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
prohibits
 
01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
any political subdivision
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
then it names off uh and then also the
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
parent of a minor child in this state
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
without obstruction or interference with
 
01:52:24.149 --> 01:52:24.159 align:start position:0%
the state and again this is apparent
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
it's singular it's not plural so
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
in a healthy home where there's both
 
01:52:32.229 --> 01:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
parents what if one disagrees
 
01:52:32.239 --> 01:52:33.350 align:start position:0%
parents what if one disagrees
who's

01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
who's
 
01:52:36.070 --> 01:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
who has the parental rights
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know uh you know which
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
i mean we heard in testimony somebody
 
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
recommended we go to court
 
01:52:44.709 --> 01:52:44.719 align:start position:0%
again let's send everybody to court
 
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh and we know what happens there so
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you and
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
representative belanger
 
01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and i had some
 
01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
of the similar
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
for recognizing me sorry so i had some
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
of the similar concerns that the
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
previous speaker
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
had which is why i had requested that
 
01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
on page three
 
01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
lines 36 through 37 specifically include
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect statute so it says
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
authorize a parent of a minor child this
 
01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
chapter does not
 
01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
specific emphasis on not
 
01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
authorize a parent of a minor child in
 
01:53:32.550 --> 01:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
this state to engage in conduct that is
 
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
unlawful or to abuse or neglect his or
 
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
her minor child in violation of general
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
law as defined in rsa 169 c
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
so i think for me
 
01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:46.070 align:start position:0%
so i think for me
this

01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
satisfies my concerns
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:56.070 --> 01:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative smith
 
01:53:58.229 --> 01:53:58.239 align:start position:0%

01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
i had that happen to me
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
i have a child with disabilities and
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
the principal of her school
 
01:54:13.589 --> 01:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
called dcyf on us and we didn't have a
 
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
my child has separation anxiety
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
and she had missed several days of
 
01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:23.270 align:start position:0%
and she had missed several days of
school

01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
several meaning 70.
 
01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:26.149 align:start position:0%
several meaning 70.
um

01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:26.159 --> 01:54:27.350 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
i i can't get her to school some days
 
01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
and i literally i'm the mother that
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
leaves her kids screaming in the parking
 
01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:33.830 align:start position:0%
leaves her kids screaming in the parking
lot

01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
lot
 
01:54:36.229 --> 01:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
and leaves there crying hysterically
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
that i'm the worst mother in the world
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
but my child has disabilities and
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
this principal had no right to call dcyf
 
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
she did not
 
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
speak to anyone
 
01:54:49.669 --> 01:54:49.679 align:start position:0%
on my daughter's iep team
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
she just looked at her attendance
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
schedule and called dcyf
 
01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:55.830 align:start position:0%
schedule and called dcyf
and

01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:58.629 --> 01:54:58.639 align:start position:0%
when we went to discuss this with her
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
her option to get my daughter to school
 
01:55:03.589 --> 01:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
was to call the police
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
and have the police come and help her
 
01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
get to school
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
she was six
 
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:15.030 --> 01:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
so needless to say this does happen and
 
01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
this happens to good
 
01:55:19.270 --> 01:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
parents and i got the letter that said i
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
am a good parent because she dismissed
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
the case
 
01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
but it does happen
 
01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
question any further representative long
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and and i
 
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:37.280 align:start position:0%

01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
i've heard several from my constituents
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
but on this committee we got to look at
 
01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
the 20 000
 
01:55:51.189 --> 01:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
oh i thought that's oh
 
01:55:54.149 --> 01:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
well you guys aren't getting 20 grand to
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
be here
 
01:55:56.709 --> 01:55:56.719 align:start position:0%
uh yeah
 
01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
at the 20 only you and i represented at
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
the 20 000 at the 20 000 l you know
 
01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:03.990 align:start position:0%
the 20 000 at the 20 000 l you know
level

01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.149 align:start position:0%
level
and

01:56:06.149 --> 01:56:06.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:08.229 --> 01:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
although bad things happen to good
 
01:56:08.239 --> 01:56:09.990 align:start position:0%
although bad things happen to good
parents

01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
what i'm more concerned about is bad
 
01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
things happen
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
happening to children because of bad
 
01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:17.510 align:start position:0%
happening to children because of bad
parents

01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:56:20.070 --> 01:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
um you know so that's what i try to look
 
01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:21.830 align:start position:0%
um you know so that's what i try to look
at

01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
is there some incidental
 
01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh what do they call it uh you
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
know collateral damage type of stuff
 
01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:31.830 align:start position:0%
know collateral damage type of stuff
um

01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
i you know i
 
01:56:36.629 --> 01:56:36.639 align:start position:0%
i look at one child being harmed
 
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm on that page
 
01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh and with respect to um
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
with respect to the language of 169c
 
01:56:49.109 --> 01:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
these are both 169i
 
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if that would go to this
 
01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
on first page 18 and
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
25 24
 
01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:11.189 --> 01:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
and then we're referencing uh does not
 
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
this chapter does not
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
authorize uh has defined in 169c
 
01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
so is that a misprint
 
01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:20.790 align:start position:0%
so is that a misprint
no

01:57:20.790 --> 01:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
169c is where the
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
um they define
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
and that's where you get your rights
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
terminated all of that is in 169
 
01:57:38.639 --> 01:57:39.669 align:start position:0%
terminated all of that is in 169
c

01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
c
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
169 i is a new
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
section that we're adding right now
 
01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:49.109 align:start position:0%
section that we're adding right now
okay

01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:50.709 --> 01:57:50.719 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:57:53.109 --> 01:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
so with respect follow-up
 
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
a follow-up for me
 
01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:56.070 align:start position:0%
a follow-up for me
certainly

01:57:56.070 --> 01:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
the the um
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
with respect to the uh
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
the state or any of its political
 
01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:04.070 align:start position:0%
the state or any of its political
subdivisions

01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
that does that does not affect uh when
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
it comes to abuse and neglect is that
 
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
representative yokela would you like to
 
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
respond thank you um so i would just
 
01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
point you to all of the exceptions not
 
01:58:26.709 --> 01:58:26.719 align:start position:0%
just that one on um
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
on the end of uh page three but it
 
01:58:33.669 --> 01:58:33.679 align:start position:0%
continues on page four that says it does
 
01:58:36.629 --> 01:58:36.639 align:start position:0%
not prohibit the court of competent
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction law enforcement officers
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
employees of the government agency that
 
01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
is responsible for child welfare from
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
acting in his official capacity within
 
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable improv prudent scope of his
 
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
earth her authority
 
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
or prohibit the court from issuing
 
01:58:54.629 --> 01:58:54.639 align:start position:0%
orders that otherwise permit permitted
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
by law including limits on some or all
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
of the items listed in this chapter as
 
01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
justice may require
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
so there's i believe that there is
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of latitude for the um
 
01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:10.629 align:start position:0%
a lot of latitude for the um
the

01:59:10.629 --> 01:59:10.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement or
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
child welfare protection to be able to
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
still do what they need to do
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
with this um those exceptions uh
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
being explicitly stated
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you follow if i may just
 
01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
is not the fact
 
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
it shall not infringe doesn't mean it's
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
any political subdivision shall not
 
01:59:51.910 --> 01:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
infringe is not the case
 
01:59:53.669 --> 01:59:53.679 align:start position:0%
right and i think that's what we were
 
01:59:53.679 --> 01:59:55.189 align:start position:0%
right and i think that's what we were
hearing

01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:59:57.750 --> 01:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
in testimony
 
01:59:58.950 --> 01:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
is what
 
02:00:03.589 --> 02:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
but now
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
we we have these two adding these two
 
02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:08.550 align:start position:0%
we we have these two adding these two
sections

02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
sections
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
police

02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
police
 
02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:17.350 align:start position:0%
police
dcyf

02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
i mean is that what we're doing
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative yokela
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%

02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
parents like carte blanche to do
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
whatever they want right this is this is
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
this bill um is
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%

the

02:00:46.149 --> 02:00:46.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:49.510 --> 02:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
schools to have a continued dialogue
 
02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:50.870 align:start position:0%
schools to have a continued dialogue
with

02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:00:53.669 --> 02:00:53.679 align:start position:0%
parents and
 
02:00:53.679 --> 02:00:54.629 align:start position:0%
parents and
that

02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:54.639 --> 02:00:56.870 align:start position:0%
that
that

02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
02:00:58.800 --> 02:00:59.750 align:start position:0%
they are not
um

02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:01.750 --> 02:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
so you don't have a fundamental right
 
02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
right to harm your children
 
02:01:04.159 --> 02:01:05.270 align:start position:0%
right to harm your children
or

02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
any other crime against the children or
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
anything that's not
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
currently allowed and this this
 
02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:14.950 align:start position:0%
currently allowed and this this
chapter

02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:15.910 align:start position:0%
chapter
says

02:01:15.910 --> 02:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
that it is not authorizing parents to
 
02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
engage in unlawful conduct so i don't
 
02:01:23.990 --> 02:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
believe that this is this is opening up
 
02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
and giving exceptions to things that are
 
02:01:27.910 --> 02:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
currently not allowed it's just
 
02:01:33.669 --> 02:01:33.679 align:start position:0%
clarifying um so that parents have um
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
a place to look at where
 
02:01:35.679 --> 02:01:36.470 align:start position:0%
a place to look at where
like

02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
what options that they do have and it
 
02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
encourages them especially because
 
02:01:43.990 --> 02:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about like schools um
 
02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
trying to post stuff online they're um
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
essentially a directive that the school
 
02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:55.830 align:start position:0%
essentially a directive that the school
boards

02:01:55.830 --> 02:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
boards
 
02:01:59.830 --> 02:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
have policies regarding
 
02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
the options of these parents and then um
 
02:02:05.830 --> 02:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
it also requires that they have
 
02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:07.270 align:start position:0%
it also requires that they have
procedures

02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
um for a parent to learn about the
 
02:02:11.199 --> 02:02:13.109 align:start position:0%
um for a parent to learn about the
additional

02:02:13.109 --> 02:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:02:14.950 --> 02:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh things that they have in statute
 
02:02:16.470 --> 02:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
options that they have in statute
 
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
including access to the instructional
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
material and and such so it's more of
 
02:02:24.149 --> 02:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
encouraging them to
 
02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
have a policy and have a have think
 
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
about how they're going to disseminate
 
02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:30.790 align:start position:0%
about how they're going to disseminate
or

02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
either disseminate the information and
 
02:02:35.669 --> 02:02:35.679 align:start position:0%
or educate the parents that they
 
02:02:38.629 --> 02:02:38.639 align:start position:0%
have these uh
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
these the ability to you know they have
 
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
the choice here and that they are free
 
02:02:44.830 --> 02:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
to exercise
 
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
it and i i
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
and so that is really the the
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
the thing uh that i see of value in this
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
and not that it's giving them more
 
02:02:56.709 --> 02:02:56.719 align:start position:0%
rights than they currently have now but
 
02:02:59.669 --> 02:02:59.679 align:start position:0%
making sure you know just like we um you
 
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
know uh have the right to remain silent
 
02:03:04.709 --> 02:03:04.719 align:start position:0%
we still tell the people they have the
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
right to remain silent when we arrest
 
02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
them it's not
 
02:03:09.030 --> 02:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
that they didn't have it before we told
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
them right we just started reminding
 
02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
them hey you have this opportunity to
 
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
exercise it right so thank you for the
 
02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:16.310 align:start position:0%
exercise it right so thank you for the
question

question
 
02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%

representative
 
02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
i think i understand what you're trying
 
02:03:46.229 --> 02:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
to say
 
02:03:48.629 --> 02:03:48.639 align:start position:0%
i was on the school board for 19 years
 
02:03:51.669 --> 02:03:51.679 align:start position:0%
eight of those years as a policy chair
 
02:03:53.830 --> 02:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
and on our website
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
every single policy that we put forth
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
included information about parental
 
02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.430 align:start position:0%
included information about parental
rights

02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:04:04.629 --> 02:04:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
anything that you could think of
 
02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
was on there
 
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
and in the committees
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
once we would go through how we felt
 
02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
about dealing with the children and the
 
02:04:18.950 --> 02:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
policies we would then underneath write
 
02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
what the parents could
 
02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
do what their rights were and
 
02:04:27.589 --> 02:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
after 19 years
 
02:04:29.589 --> 02:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
i mean i was at every meeting
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
we never had
 
02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
a parent come in and say you know you
 
02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:35.350 align:start position:0%
a parent come in and say you know you
didn't

02:04:35.350 --> 02:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
let me come and speak to the teacher or
 
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
i wasn't part of the iep or
 
02:04:41.669 --> 02:04:41.679 align:start position:0%
you know something negative they were
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
always offered and it's written and
 
02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
there's a book like that
 
02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
that big with all the policies not just
 
02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
for the children
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
but for the parents as well
 
02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:53.669 align:start position:0%
but for the parents as well
so

02:04:53.669 --> 02:04:53.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if
 
02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
if we do this
 
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
does that take away from the
 
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
the districts
 
02:05:05.669 --> 02:05:05.679 align:start position:0%
that are doing their own
 
02:05:05.679 --> 02:05:07.109 align:start position:0%
that are doing their own
policies

02:05:07.109 --> 02:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
policies
 
02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
i mean we worked really hard
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing
 
02:05:14.069 --> 02:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
for both the children and the parents
 
02:05:14.079 --> 02:05:14.870 align:start position:0%
for both the children and the parents
so

02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
how would that affect
 
02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
02:05:26.470 --> 02:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
i am happy to hear that that your your
 
02:05:29.109 --> 02:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
district is already doing um this stuff
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
so in in the language the only
 
02:05:33.750 --> 02:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
requirement is that they have a policy
 
02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
it's not dictating the method of saying
 
02:05:38.470 --> 02:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
um you have to post it on the website
 
02:05:40.069 --> 02:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
and you guys are providing it you know
 
02:05:41.589 --> 02:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
in the library or something like that
 
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement that you post
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
something or it's just that the paul
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
that the the board should consider
 
02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
um this and have this issue and create a
 
02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
policy for it and if and
 
02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
by your testimony it seems like the the
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
district that you're that you were a
 
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
part of already was following those best
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
practices and
 
02:06:08.629 --> 02:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
and had positive effects and so um i
 
02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
think that it's possible that this
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislation if passed may have no effect
 
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
on your um
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
your district at all it would only
 
02:06:20.229 --> 02:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
encourage the other
 
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
districts that may not have such a um
 
02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:24.629 align:start position:0%
districts that may not have such a um
well

02:06:24.629 --> 02:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:06:24.639 --> 02:06:29.589 align:start position:0%
well
um

02:06:29.589 --> 02:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:32.950 --> 02:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
like um a well like exp
 
02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
no no um i was saying like expand
 
02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
expansive amount of policies regarding
 
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
um the opportunities of parents to
 
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
um be
 
02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
yes comprehensive robust i'm getting a
 
02:06:53.109 --> 02:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
lot of a lot of help
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
robust amount of
 
02:06:55.679 --> 02:06:57.109 align:start position:0%
robust amount of
policies

02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
policies
 
02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
that explain the parents ability or
 
02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
encourage the parents ability to
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
take an active part in the person the
 
02:07:08.709 --> 02:07:08.719 align:start position:0%
their child's education
 
02:07:08.719 --> 02:07:10.830 align:start position:0%
their child's education
and

02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
02:07:13.990 --> 02:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
i mean in the testimony it seemed like
 
02:07:16.069 --> 02:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
that is not the case in all of them and
 
02:07:16.079 --> 02:07:16.790 align:start position:0%
that is not the case in all of them and
so

02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:07:18.310 --> 02:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
i um
 
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
want to encourage
 
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
all of them to to be i guess as as you
 
02:07:24.790 --> 02:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
said kind of like a shining example that
 
02:07:28.069 --> 02:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
this is where we we want you to be
 
02:07:30.069 --> 02:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
involved right in the in your parents
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
learning and
 
02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:32.709 align:start position:0%
learning and
and

02:07:32.709 --> 02:07:32.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
it would be hard to achieve greatness
 
02:07:37.350 --> 02:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
for those that are good outcomes for
 
02:07:39.430 --> 02:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
those kids if you are not involved kind
 
02:07:41.669 --> 02:07:41.679 align:start position:0%
of a thing that's i think the general
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
gist of the the bill so yeah thank you
 
02:07:45.270 --> 02:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:46.550 align:start position:0%
follow up please
sure

02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:47.750 align:start position:0%
sure
um

02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
so after the policies are made they then
 
02:07:52.069 --> 02:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
go to the superintendents and they have
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
superintendent meetings with all of the
 
02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
superintendents throughout the state
 
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
and then they're all approved
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:08.709 --> 02:08:08.719 align:start position:0%
we're sort of double dipping you know
 
02:08:10.069 --> 02:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
it's sort of
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
you know mom says no dad says yes
 
02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
most of the most of the districts that
 
02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
i'm familiar with do do that and by law
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
it says you know
 
02:08:28.149 --> 02:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
it's like a parent
 
02:08:31.189 --> 02:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
statement you have to notify the parents
 
02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:39.189 --> 02:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
so if we do this this i feel like
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:44.709 --> 02:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
the educational
 
02:08:44.719 --> 02:08:45.750 align:start position:0%
the educational
standard

02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
standard
 
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
i can't think of
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
does it make sense what i'm saying to
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
you no it does not i didn't think it
 
02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:55.510 align:start position:0%
you no it does not i didn't think it
would

02:08:55.510 --> 02:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:08:58.390 --> 02:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
i i mean i have a question um
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
in what you just said as far as um
 
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
you were coming up with the policies at
 
02:09:06.629 --> 02:09:06.639 align:start position:0%
the local level and then they were
 
02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
adopted at the state level as far as
 
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
like governing all of them oh no no no
 
02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:12.870 align:start position:0%
like governing all of them oh no no no
okay

02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:09:14.390 --> 02:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
sorry that's
 
02:09:16.390 --> 02:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's what i was i was worried about so
 
02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
you were um because it seemed like you
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
were saying
 
02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh the state level has this this
 
02:09:24.149 --> 02:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
overarching policy and then we're making
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
the local levels have their own separate
 
02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
policy and that's where the double
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
dipping happen
 
02:09:30.069 --> 02:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:09:31.990 --> 02:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
but if that's not the case then yeah i
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
just uh the local level can have their
 
02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
their different differing policies based
 
02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
on the the needs of that community and
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
that would be completely in alignment
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
with this bill i believe so thank you
 
02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:44.470 align:start position:0%
with this bill i believe so thank you
okay

02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:45.750 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:49.280 align:start position:0%

02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:51.040 align:start position:0%

02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
i would like to
 
02:09:56.950 --> 02:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
i would like to discuss
 
02:10:00.069 --> 02:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
page two of the amendment lines 11
 
02:10:05.109 --> 02:10:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:08.550 --> 02:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:09.669 align:start position:0%
 
reserve

02:10:09.669 --> 02:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
reserve
 
02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
another question for page 4 line
 
02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:14.229 align:start position:0%

and 19.
 
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
so first page 2
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
of the amendment lines 11 through 15 an

02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions
 
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
including without limitation
 
02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
any school board school district or
 
02:10:33.589 --> 02:10:33.599 align:start position:0%
school administrative unit or any other
 
02:10:36.709 --> 02:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
governmental entity who encourages

02:10:41.109 --> 02:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
coerce
 
02:10:44.550 --> 02:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
a minor child to withhold information
 
02:10:47.109 --> 02:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
from his or her parent who is not
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
suspected of a criminal offense against
 
02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
the minor
 
02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
and sharing the information would not
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
impede an investigation of a criminal
 
02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
offense against the minor may be
 
02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:57.589 align:start position:0%
offense against the minor may be
subjected

02:10:57.589 --> 02:10:57.599 align:start position:0%
subjected
 
02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
subject subject to disciplinary action
 
02:11:02.950 --> 02:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
so i read that and red flags went up for
 
02:11:04.390 --> 02:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
me um
 
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
we know that um
 
02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
schools are a place where children have
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
some real consistency
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
and they have some influential adults in
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
their lives
 
02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:24.550 align:start position:0%
their lives
and

02:11:24.550 --> 02:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:26.310 --> 02:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
that when
 
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
children are
 
02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:29.830 align:start position:0%
children are
struggling

02:11:29.830 --> 02:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
struggling
 
02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:31.109 align:start position:0%
struggling
with

02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:11:32.950 --> 02:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
personal issues
 
02:11:35.669 --> 02:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
that safe space to
 
02:11:38.550 --> 02:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
talk sometimes is outside the scope of
 
02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
their family
 
02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:41.530 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
02:11:45.109 --> 02:11:45.119 align:start position:0%
i'm curious
 
02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
and i want to know what protections in
 
02:11:50.790 --> 02:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
that paragraph
 
02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
allow for a child
 
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:58.229 --> 02:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
02:11:58.239 --> 02:11:59.270 align:start position:0%
thinking about
sharing

02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%

with their parents
 
02:12:05.189 --> 02:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
but fear
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
that that will not be well received
 
02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:10.629 align:start position:0%
that that will not be well received
and

02:12:10.629 --> 02:12:10.639 align:start position:0%

many children find a space of confidence

02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
had a conversation with that other
 
02:12:50.310 --> 02:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
trusted adult and that trusted adult
 
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:56.709 --> 02:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
tell that tell the parent thus breaking
 
02:12:58.870 --> 02:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
the trust of the child
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
a parent could bring that trusted adult
 
02:13:08.069 --> 02:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
as of page four
 
02:13:13.350 --> 02:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
can we answer that question first right
 
02:13:15.189 --> 02:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
it's all together that
 
02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
a violation of the page 2 lines 11
 
02:13:20.709 --> 02:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
through 15
 
02:13:23.189 --> 02:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:25.830 --> 02:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
in the example i gave would result
 
02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
in violations and criminal
 
02:13:34.870 --> 02:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
charges on page 4 line 7
 
02:13:56.830 --> 02:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:58.629 --> 02:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
representative yo keller would you like
 
02:14:00.790 --> 02:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
to respond
 
02:14:03.189 --> 02:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank you i don't i don't uh
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:06.629 align:start position:0%
believe that
um

02:14:06.629 --> 02:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:08.790 --> 02:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
the representative statement is
 
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
reflective of
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:13.589 align:start position:0%
of the bill
um

02:14:13.589 --> 02:14:13.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:13.599 --> 02:14:16.709 align:start position:0%
um
there

02:14:16.709 --> 02:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:16.719 --> 02:14:19.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:14:19.270 --> 02:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
02:14:23.910 --> 02:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
requirement that the person
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
tell the parent that they reached out to
 
02:14:28.870 --> 02:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
the kid
 
02:14:31.270 --> 02:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
or that or the kid reached out to them
 
02:14:34.870 --> 02:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
about anything this only says
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
that when they seek guidance from that
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
trusted adult
 
02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
the adult shouldn't say well just don't
 
02:14:44.870 --> 02:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
may i follow up
 
02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:49.109 align:start position:0%
may i follow up
yes

02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:14:49.119 --> 02:14:50.390 align:start position:0%
yes
so

02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're in this um we're in this
 
02:14:55.430 --> 02:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill is there protection for that
 
02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:56.629 align:start position:0%
bill is there protection for that
teacher

02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
02:14:58.709 --> 02:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
when that parent
 
02:15:03.910 --> 02:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
feeling as magnanimous as you are right
 
02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
now and says what do you mean
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
you told
 
02:15:13.109 --> 02:15:13.119 align:start position:0%
mr jenkins that
 
02:15:14.950 --> 02:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
you wanted to
 
02:15:15.990 --> 02:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:15:18.709 --> 02:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
talk to talk to us about your sexual
 
02:15:20.069 --> 02:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
identity what do you mean they knew
 
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
before i did
 
02:15:24.709 --> 02:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
did why why do they know before i did so
 
02:15:27.750 --> 02:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
under this law i can go to the superior
 
02:15:30.629 --> 02:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
court and file a claim saying that
 
02:15:30.639 --> 02:15:31.430 align:start position:0%
court and file a claim saying that
um

02:15:31.430 --> 02:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:34.550 --> 02:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
that mr jenkins encouraged my child to
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
be quiet and now it's mr jenkins
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility to
 
02:15:39.199 --> 02:15:41.109 align:start position:0%
responsibility to
to

02:15:41.109 --> 02:15:41.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
protect himself against a claim that
 
02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
may or may not be true how do you prove
 
02:15:49.750 --> 02:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
that a child
 
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
who is now feeling very very
 
02:15:56.229 --> 02:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
persecuted which is probably why they
 
02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
went to a teacher or a trusted librarian
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
or a trusted coach or another trusted
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
adult to share some information and this
 
02:16:07.589 --> 02:16:07.599 align:start position:0%
is outside the scope of a criminal
 
02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
investigation and if that parent is
 
02:16:13.669 --> 02:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
angry we have given them a space
 
02:16:16.830 --> 02:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
to press charges to have a
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
disciplinary um
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
letter added to a personnel file to
 
02:16:25.350 --> 02:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
possibly be um subject to being guilty
 
02:16:27.910 --> 02:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
of a class b misdemeanor
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
this really really puts a chilling
 
02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
effect on teachers coaches parents
 
02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:35.509 align:start position:0%
effect on teachers coaches parents
librarians

02:16:35.509 --> 02:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
librarians
 
02:16:35.519 --> 02:16:36.469 align:start position:0%
librarians
to

02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
develop those interpersonal
 
02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
relationships with children
 
02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:41.830 align:start position:0%
relationships with children
that

02:16:41.830 --> 02:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:43.349 align:start position:0%
that
encourages

02:16:43.349 --> 02:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
encourages
 
02:16:43.359 --> 02:16:44.870 align:start position:0%
encourages
growth

02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
growth
 
02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know this is this representative i
 
02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
find this chilling uh
 
02:16:52.469 --> 02:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
and you're entitled to your feelings but
 
02:16:53.830 --> 02:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh in this
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh bill uh section two uh line 11
 
02:16:58.800 --> 02:16:59.750 align:start position:0%
uh bill uh section two uh line 11
through

02:16:59.750 --> 02:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
16 it only discusses
 
02:17:06.790 --> 02:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
if that person encourages or coerce
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
coerces or attempts to encourage it
 
02:17:09.599 --> 02:17:10.549 align:start position:0%
coerces or attempts to encourage it
doesn't

02:17:10.549 --> 02:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
say anything about if the child goes to
 
02:17:15.190 --> 02:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
that person in confidence
 
02:17:17.589 --> 02:17:17.599 align:start position:0%
if that person says well don't tell your
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
parents or
 
02:17:22.389 --> 02:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
anything to that effect then the
 
02:17:24.549 --> 02:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor would take place i think
 
02:17:24.559 --> 02:17:25.910 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor would take place i think
that

02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:17:28.309 --> 02:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we tend to be a legit
 
02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
litigious society and if the parents
 
02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
want to sue they
 
02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
they have every legal right to sue but
 
02:17:37.830 --> 02:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with this bill
 
02:17:39.270 --> 02:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
questions i i i have i have another one
 
02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
if if i may
 
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
one more thank you we have children um
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
that are are currently
 
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
in emergency departments going through
 
02:17:57.190 --> 02:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
acute psych psychiatric crises
 
02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:03.589 align:start position:0%
acute psych psychiatric crises
and

02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:05.349 --> 02:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
a significant number of those acute
 
02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
psychiatric crises are from rejection
 
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
of parents accepting their gender
 
02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:13.270 align:start position:0%
of parents accepting their gender
identity

02:18:13.270 --> 02:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
identity
 
02:18:14.870 --> 02:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
and this
 
02:18:16.870 --> 02:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with this bill i
 
02:18:19.750 --> 02:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
would say uh respectfully madam chair i
 
02:18:22.709 --> 02:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
would say that this opens us this closes
 
02:18:24.950 --> 02:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
a space for
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
for exactly the kind of trusted adults
 
02:18:29.190 --> 02:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
that we try to cultivate in our
 
02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:30.309 align:start position:0%
that we try to cultivate in our
communities

02:18:30.309 --> 02:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:18:34.709 --> 02:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
for children to be able to go to and
 
02:18:34.719 --> 02:18:35.750 align:start position:0%
for children to be able to go to and
this

02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:18:38.790 --> 02:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
this tells all of those trusted
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
potentially trusted adults that it would
 
02:18:42.790 --> 02:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
be safer for them
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
to shut that down and to not do that
 
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
because they could
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
be written up
 
02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:49.830 align:start position:0%
be written up
for

02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
a disciplinary violation or possibly be
 
02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
guilty of a class b misdemeanor and that
 
02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
this this is not in the best interest of
 
02:18:59.669 --> 02:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
children this is in the best interest of
 
02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
parents who
 
02:19:02.709 --> 02:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
feel that they are
 
02:19:02.719 --> 02:19:03.429 align:start position:0%
feel that they are
they

02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
they're out of control and i
 
02:19:08.950 --> 02:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your thought-provoking
 
02:19:11.349 --> 02:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
02:19:20.709 --> 02:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
long thank you madam chair so a couple
 
02:19:22.870 --> 02:19:22.880 align:start position:0%

things the fact that uh and courage and
coerce

02:19:24.870 --> 02:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
coerce
 
02:19:27.270 --> 02:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
from a coach that told
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
one of my players that um
 
02:19:32.830 --> 02:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
told me that they tried
 
02:19:35.429 --> 02:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
marijuana um
 
02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
and i didn't get to the parents quick
 
02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:37.990 align:start position:0%
and i didn't get to the parents quick
enough

02:19:37.990 --> 02:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
as a parent i'm gonna be upset and i'm
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
gonna i'm gonna tell
 
02:19:45.030 --> 02:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna i'm gonna tell the coach that
 
02:19:47.190 --> 02:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i think you told him to keep it
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
between us you know why would he go
 
02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
would he go to you and not me so this
 
02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
isn't this is encouraging that
 
02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
and the bottom line is i think
 
02:19:58.950 --> 02:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
i think i think this is all about
 
02:19:58.960 --> 02:20:00.309 align:start position:0%
i think i think this is all about
election

02:20:00.309 --> 02:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:20:02.389 --> 02:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
i mean whomever is in these school
 
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
districts that aren't giving out this
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
information it's a matter of an election
 
02:20:08.550 --> 02:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
you need to vote them out and put people
 
02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:09.270 align:start position:0%
you need to vote them out and put people
in

02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
that are complying with what the law
 
02:20:15.429 --> 02:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
already requires with public information
 
02:20:17.429 --> 02:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
so it's an election process it's a
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
warrant article not a
 
02:20:21.750 --> 02:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
not a statutory fix because i don't
 
02:20:23.349 --> 02:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
believe this is going to fix anything
 
02:20:25.349 --> 02:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
and it's going to create more of an
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
issue with courts and within committee
 
02:20:36.070 --> 02:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
representative levesque
 
02:20:39.910 --> 02:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
so on
 
02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
page two lines one through three
 
02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
it talks about the
 
02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
parents right to enroll them into
 
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
any type of school public
 
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
or private religious
 
02:20:55.710 --> 02:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
that's already into statute with rsa
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
1931 the parent already has a right to
 
02:21:00.870 --> 02:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
choose how their
 
02:21:02.309 --> 02:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
child is taught whether that's
 
02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
religiously or
 
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
02:21:08.469 --> 02:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
grew up in a town where we got to
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
choose which high school we got to go to
 
02:21:10.479 --> 02:21:11.270 align:start position:0%
choose which high school we got to go to
because

02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
my school district did not have a high
 
02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
school built in town and so we got to
 
02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
choose whether to go to
 
02:21:21.910 --> 02:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
one school or another or we had a chance
 
02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
for three you know in those
 
02:21:26.469 --> 02:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
types of school districts the parents
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
always have the right to choose which
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
school their child goes to
 
02:21:33.270 --> 02:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
how they're taught
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know it's up to the parents so
 
02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative petrino
 
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair and and
 
02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative levesque for
 
02:21:48.070 --> 02:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
your comment because i was actually
 
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
thinking uh the same thing
 
02:21:52.630 --> 02:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
i was a high school teacher for 40 years
 
02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that as a matter of
 
02:21:56.790 --> 02:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
state law
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh department of education policy and
 
02:22:01.190 --> 02:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
school district policies most of what's
 
02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
in this bill already exists
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
and it's it's redundant
 
02:22:09.750 --> 02:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
if it's not happening it's happening on
 
02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
some occasions not enough to justify
 
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
state legislation it really is a matter
 
02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:15.990 align:start position:0%
state legislation it really is a matter
of

02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
those parents who have grievances
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
going to the school and then going to
 
02:22:22.150 --> 02:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
the superintendent and then to the
 
02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
school board and if they're not happy
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
with what's going on then vote them out
 
02:22:28.710 --> 02:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
i can tell you in my town of milford
 
02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
right now there's a lot of contention
 
02:22:32.070 --> 02:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
going on and there are a lot of people
 
02:22:34.469 --> 02:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
who actually have come forward and
 
02:22:36.150 --> 02:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
they're running for school board because
 
02:22:37.990 --> 02:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
they want to make changes in that school
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
district but what's happening in my
 
02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
school district is not necessarily
 
02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
happening in another school district
 
02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
where things are going fine
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
and again i will tell you that most of
 
02:22:49.830 --> 02:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
what's in this legislation already is a
 
02:22:51.670 --> 02:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
matter of statute
 
02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire department of ed policy
 
02:22:56.150 --> 02:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
and local school district policy and as
 
02:22:57.990 --> 02:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
a teacher of 40 years i'll be honest
 
02:22:59.830 --> 02:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
with you i supervised
 
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
a department and
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
most of the complaints that i got as a
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
department chair came from whether or
 
02:23:08.469 --> 02:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
not a child's grade on a test was fair
 
02:23:10.790 --> 02:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
or not because maybe the teacher graded
 
02:23:12.710 --> 02:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
it wrong and you know you're being
 
02:23:15.270 --> 02:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
unfair to my child most of the issues
 
02:23:17.429 --> 02:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
that are here i never ever witnessed in
 
02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
my 40 years this this bill really is not
 
02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
necessary if there's a problem to be
 
02:23:24.070 --> 02:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
fixed it needs to be fixed at the local
 
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:34.670 --> 02:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
any new information to come
 
02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:36.550 align:start position:0%
any new information to come

and 29.
 
02:23:48.309 --> 02:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
and the center of page and the center of
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
line 27 if a parent is dissatisfied with
 
02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
the results of such an appeal
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
or such an appeal does not take place in
 
02:23:59.110 --> 02:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
a timely fashion as required by this
 
02:24:01.830 --> 02:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph which is within 10 business
 
02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
days the aggrieved parent may appeal the
 
02:24:06.790 --> 02:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
matter to superior court with
 
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the applicable school
 
02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:10.790 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the applicable school
district

02:24:10.790 --> 02:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:24:12.469 --> 02:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
so now
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
when a parent is dissatisfied with the
 
02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:17.510 align:start position:0%
when a parent is dissatisfied with the
answer

02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
answer
 
02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
that um a trusted adult
 
02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:22.710 align:start position:0%
that um a trusted adult
was

02:24:22.710 --> 02:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
providing a space for a child to
 
02:24:29.190 --> 02:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
explore and and
 
02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
explore the ways to talk about
 
02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
something that's very personal to them
 
02:24:36.469 --> 02:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
and then the parent
 
02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
sends a letter to the superintendent
 
02:24:40.389 --> 02:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
asking how did this happen why did this
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
happen and the parent is dissatisfied
 
02:24:44.469 --> 02:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
with that report
 
02:24:44.479 --> 02:24:45.510 align:start position:0%
with that report
now

02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
the parent can take it to superior court
 
02:24:49.429 --> 02:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
and i think we have learned over this
 
02:24:52.710 --> 02:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
past two years that um it's that that
 
02:24:53.590 --> 02:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:24:56.309 --> 02:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
a number of parents who have no problem
 
02:24:56.319 --> 02:24:57.670 align:start position:0%
a number of parents who have no problem
whatsoever

02:24:57.670 --> 02:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
02:25:03.510 --> 02:25:03.520 align:start position:0%

i was at a
 
02:25:15.670 --> 02:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
i had the honor
 
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
of being part of a
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
boy scout
 
02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:22.560 align:start position:0%

really active
 
02:25:27.270 --> 02:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
scouting community in the town of

in fifth and sixth grade

02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
like this and um with a chair and a vice
 
02:25:47.110 --> 02:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
chair and a clerk and
 
02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
people sitting here to witness
 
02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:50.630 align:start position:0%
people sitting here to witness
and

02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
when we got to the end for the q and a
 
02:25:57.190 --> 02:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
said representative alcheler
 
02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
what are you doing in concord
 
02:26:05.750 --> 02:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
for the trans kids
 
02:26:08.790 --> 02:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
and the other students the other scouts
 
02:26:10.870 --> 02:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
did this
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
and for them that's a silent way of
 
02:26:15.429 --> 02:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
saying yeah i agree with you yes i want
 
02:26:17.349 --> 02:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
to ask that question too
 
02:26:17.359 --> 02:26:18.389 align:start position:0%
to ask that question too
yes

02:26:18.389 --> 02:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:26:21.429 --> 02:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
please i want to know the answer
 
02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
and so you know i talked about a few
 
02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:26.389 align:start position:0%
and so you know i talked about a few
things

02:26:26.389 --> 02:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:26:28.070 --> 02:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
but right now
 
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
this is what we can do for those kids
 
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
is this a this is not a
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill that is a
 
02:26:38.469 --> 02:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
this is not a bill that is um
 
02:26:39.990 --> 02:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
a bill of rights
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
for children
 
02:26:44.950 --> 02:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
and this space on page two lines eleven
 
02:26:46.830 --> 02:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
through fifteen
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
um doesn't help children it actually
 
02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
creates spaces that can hurt them we
 
02:26:55.270 --> 02:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
have children in new hampshire who have
 
02:26:58.630 --> 02:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
been placed outside of our state in
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
psychiatric facilities
 
02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:03.429 align:start position:0%
psychiatric facilities
specifically

02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:27:07.349 --> 02:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
because of gender identity
 
02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:14.230 --> 02:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
have placed them in facilities outside
 
02:27:17.110 --> 02:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
of our state because
 
02:27:18.550 --> 02:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
because we say that
 
02:27:20.389 --> 02:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
the trans kids
 
02:27:23.270 --> 02:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
are perfect they're our kids
 
02:27:28.389 --> 02:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
to create
 
02:27:33.590 --> 02:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
conflict for those children so for
 
02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
for my scouts this one's for you
 
02:27:38.630 --> 02:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
i will not support
 
02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:53.670 --> 02:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for recognizing me
 
02:27:57.190 --> 02:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
to speak on the matter i think it's
 
02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
important to recognize that
 
02:28:02.710 --> 02:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
to the previous speaker's point this
 
02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't mention anything about
 
02:28:07.830 --> 02:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
trans or trans rights or
 
02:28:09.670 --> 02:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
anything along those lines what it does
 
02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:10.870 align:start position:0%
anything along those lines what it does
mention

02:28:10.870 --> 02:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
mention
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
is parental rights
 
02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:15.670 align:start position:0%
is parental rights
and

02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:17.750 --> 02:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
parental rights and education
 
02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:18.710 align:start position:0%
parental rights and education
and

02:28:18.710 --> 02:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
as a parent
 
02:28:23.910 --> 02:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
and i believe and as i stated to my
 
02:28:25.750 --> 02:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
community as well when we had this issue
 
02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:27.510 align:start position:0%
community as well when we had this issue
presented

02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
presented
 
02:28:30.389 --> 02:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
by a former member of this committee
 
02:28:30.399 --> 02:28:31.670 align:start position:0%
by a former member of this committee
that

02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:33.429 --> 02:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
a child's
 
02:28:33.439 --> 02:28:34.389 align:start position:0%
a child's
issue

02:28:34.389 --> 02:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:28:36.230 --> 02:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
of being
 
02:28:38.389 --> 02:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
transgender or not and i'm not saying
 
02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
that is an issue for the record in case
 
02:28:45.429 --> 02:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
if if they have this scenario and they
 
02:28:49.830 --> 02:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
need to go through that process they
 
02:28:51.270 --> 02:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
have that right to go through that
 
02:28:53.670 --> 02:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
process i am not disagreeing with that
 
02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
but it is the parents right that they
 
02:28:58.230 --> 02:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
should be informed
 
02:29:00.150 --> 02:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
in a joint
 
02:29:03.110 --> 02:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
collective agreement to sit down and
 
02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
communicate and chat because i as a
 
02:29:09.429 --> 02:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
parent should never be left out of the
 
02:29:11.590 --> 02:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
decision that someone else is making for
 
02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
my under age child and with that i
 
02:29:17.990 --> 02:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
conclude my comments
 
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:25.590 --> 02:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
i'll take one more and then i'm going to
 
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
move the question
 
02:29:27.120 --> 02:29:27.990 align:start position:0%
move the question
um

02:29:27.990 --> 02:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
madam chair representative smith if you
 
02:29:33.270 --> 02:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
have every right not to take my question
 
02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:34.230 align:start position:0%
have every right not to take my question
um

02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:36.309 --> 02:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
you as chair are in control so if you
 
02:29:38.070 --> 02:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
would rather i not say anything you
 
02:29:39.910 --> 02:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
should just say that
 
02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
that's not my intent
 
02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative because i respect your
 
02:29:48.309 --> 02:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
right as chair i i particularly want to
 
02:29:48.319 --> 02:29:49.750 align:start position:0%
right as chair i i particularly want to
um

02:29:49.750 --> 02:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:54.950 --> 02:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:00.389 --> 02:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
christina dyer to prepare
 
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
this document that was just handed out
 
02:30:09.349 --> 02:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
to us i don't know if members of the
 
02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
committee had a chance to see this
 
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
before today
 
02:30:16.710 --> 02:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
but it is superb it is in
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
as usual as and i expect that kind of
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
work from committee researchers
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's very well done and i go through
 
02:30:24.960 --> 02:30:26.710 align:start position:0%
it's very well done and i go through
every

02:30:26.710 --> 02:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
every
 
02:30:31.590 --> 02:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
section of 1431 as introduced
 
02:30:36.469 --> 02:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:39.670 --> 02:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
is the documentation referred to
 
02:30:42.550 --> 02:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
by a number of our colleagues
 
02:30:46.550 --> 02:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
that says this is already in
 
02:30:46.560 --> 02:30:47.590 align:start position:0%
that says this is already in
in

02:30:47.590 --> 02:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:30:50.469 --> 02:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
state and federal constitution in state
 
02:30:52.389 --> 02:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
and federal law
 
02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
and uh and then also as we know since we
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
believe in local control
 
02:30:59.270 --> 02:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
in in
 
02:31:01.110 --> 02:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
at least we say we believe in local
 
02:31:04.550 --> 02:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
control whether we do or not um
 
02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:05.349 align:start position:0%
control whether we do or not um
in

02:31:05.349 --> 02:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:31:08.950 --> 02:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
in local school districts so that seems
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
to me
 
02:31:10.640 --> 02:31:13.270 align:start position:0%
to me
that

02:31:13.270 --> 02:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
it is at least redundant
 
02:31:18.070 --> 02:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
if not
 
02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
almost insulting
 
02:31:24.070 --> 02:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
to deny the existence
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
of all of this language
 
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
that already exists and
 
02:31:32.950 --> 02:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
therefore it is very hard for me to
 
02:31:35.030 --> 02:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:36.630 align:start position:0%
figure out
exactly

02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
02:31:39.429 --> 02:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
what the purpose
 
02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
of this legislation
 
02:31:41.680 --> 02:31:44.230 align:start position:0%
of this legislation
is

02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:47.670 --> 02:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
given that all this really exists
 
02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
unless we want to make a statement
 
02:31:54.389 --> 02:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm just not sure that legislation
 
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
should be used to make statements and i
 
02:31:58.710 --> 02:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
again thank you for the courtesy of
 
02:32:01.750 --> 02:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
letting me speak and i want to
 
02:32:03.990 --> 02:32:04.000 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair so it was a little

bit longer um this amendment than i was
 
02:49:05.030 --> 02:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
kind of uh
 
02:49:06.550 --> 02:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
alluding to but one of the things that
 
02:49:09.110 --> 02:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
was brought up during the first part of
 
02:49:11.030 --> 02:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
our first year session as i brought
 
02:49:13.830 --> 02:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
forward another bill was that during the
 
02:49:15.910 --> 02:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
guardianship and adopt uh prior to the
 
02:49:18.230 --> 02:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
adoption process there's no visit being
 
02:49:19.590 --> 02:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
done in a home
 
02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:20.389 align:start position:0%
done in a home
so

02:49:20.389 --> 02:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:49:22.710 --> 02:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
as promised i brought forward this bill
 
02:49:23.990 --> 02:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
and this is what you see before you
 
02:49:25.269 --> 02:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
today so
 
02:49:25.279 --> 02:49:26.710 align:start position:0%
today so
um

02:49:26.710 --> 02:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:28.710 --> 02:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
the guardianship statues and
 
02:49:32.230 --> 02:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
appointments go under rsa 169c and rsa
 
02:49:35.349 --> 02:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
463. this requires that after the
 
02:49:38.230 --> 02:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
appointment within 60 days
 
02:49:41.750 --> 02:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
the the guardian the guardians shall
 
02:49:43.830 --> 02:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
receive a home visit by a child care
 
02:49:47.429 --> 02:49:47.439 align:start position:0%
agency now this is any agency that is
 
02:49:48.870 --> 02:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
approved by the department of health and
 
02:49:51.750 --> 02:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
human services and licensed by them to
 
02:49:54.150 --> 02:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
do such visits like home assessments
 
02:49:55.830 --> 02:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
during the adoption process and very
 
02:49:57.750 --> 02:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
similar in that instance
 
02:49:57.760 --> 02:49:58.630 align:start position:0%
similar in that instance
um

02:49:58.630 --> 02:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:02.950 --> 02:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
the home visit and this is where i'm um
 
02:50:04.710 --> 02:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
i was hesitant to add this but i think
 
02:50:08.710 --> 02:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
this is this is good as some parents um
 
02:50:12.550 --> 02:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
may agree to to the guardianship that um
 
02:50:15.510 --> 02:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
you may have the um
 
02:50:17.030 --> 02:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
and this is so
 
02:50:18.950 --> 02:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
the home visit may be waived if the
 
02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:20.150 align:start position:0%
the home visit may be waived if the
parents

02:50:20.150 --> 02:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
parents
 
02:50:21.990 --> 02:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
give consent of the guardianship which
 
02:50:23.750 --> 02:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
means they if they agree to the
 
02:50:26.150 --> 02:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
guardianship and are not contesting it
 
02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:27.349 align:start position:0%
guardianship and are not contesting it
now

02:50:27.349 --> 02:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:50:27.359 --> 02:50:28.950 align:start position:0%
now
in

02:50:28.950 --> 02:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:50:31.429 --> 02:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
the adoption
 
02:50:34.950 --> 02:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
rsa you may ask for a waiver of the home
 
02:50:37.349 --> 02:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
assessment and this is what my previous
 
02:50:39.429 --> 02:50:39.439 align:start position:0%
bill had done to reduce the
 
02:50:41.750 --> 02:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
the restrictions on that so
 
02:50:44.230 --> 02:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
there's still the ability to allow for
 
02:50:45.670 --> 02:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:50:49.510 --> 02:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
visit to be waived uh the cost
 
02:50:51.590 --> 02:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
of the agency visit shall be paid for by
 
02:50:52.790 --> 02:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
the guardian
 
02:50:55.349 --> 02:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
um the agency sell
 
02:50:56.870 --> 02:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
visit within 30
 
02:50:59.030 --> 02:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
after within 30 days excuse me issue a
 
02:51:02.630 --> 02:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
report to the court and the guardian
 
02:51:04.389 --> 02:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
indicating the home is a safe
 
02:51:06.389 --> 02:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
environment for the minor child
 
02:51:08.950 --> 02:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
or if unsafe lists the unsafe issue or
 
02:51:10.550 --> 02:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
issues to be corrected
 
02:51:12.630 --> 02:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
proof of the corrected issues shall be
 
02:51:14.070 --> 02:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
submitted by the guardian to the court
 
02:51:17.510 --> 02:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
and the agency within 30 days
 
02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
if the guardian fails to remedy safety
 
02:51:21.990 --> 02:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
issues as referenced in sub-paragraph b
 
02:51:23.670 --> 02:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
the agency shall promptly notify the
 
02:51:25.269 --> 02:51:25.279 align:start position:0%
court and the guardian for appropriate
 
02:51:26.630 --> 02:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
judicial action
 
02:51:28.389 --> 02:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
failure failure
 
02:51:29.830 --> 02:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
with this section without good cause
 
02:51:31.349 --> 02:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
shown shall be grounds for judicial
 
02:51:35.030 --> 02:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
review so i think this is just
 
02:51:37.269 --> 02:51:37.279 align:start position:0%
as simply put
 
02:51:38.790 --> 02:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
a brief
 
02:51:42.230 --> 02:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
our visit from an agency
 
02:51:42.240 --> 02:51:44.630 align:start position:0%
our visit from an agency
max

02:51:44.630 --> 02:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:48.309 --> 02:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
you know minimal cost um to this just to
 
02:51:51.190 --> 02:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that um kiddos are placed in a
 
02:51:53.510 --> 02:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
safe home and you know knives aren't
 
02:51:55.030 --> 02:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
left on the counter
 
02:51:56.950 --> 02:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
there aren't holes in the floor
 
02:51:58.070 --> 02:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:52:01.030 --> 02:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
an unsafe living environment it's not
 
02:52:03.510 --> 02:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
an inhabitable place to live so simple
 
02:52:05.910 --> 02:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
as that and um
 
02:52:08.870 --> 02:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh yeah that's it
 
02:52:11.269 --> 02:52:11.279 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative smith you
 
02:52:12.469 --> 02:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
02:52:14.870 --> 02:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
i do thank you very much i have a
 
02:52:18.230 --> 02:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
question for the sponsor um
 
02:52:18.240 --> 02:52:19.910 align:start position:0%
question for the sponsor um
uh

02:52:19.910 --> 02:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:52:24.389 --> 02:52:24.399 align:start position:0%
the where it says that the guardian
 
02:52:25.830 --> 02:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
must pay
 
02:52:29.910 --> 02:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:32.309 --> 02:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
that's i just am
 
02:52:35.510 --> 02:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about what happens if we
 
02:52:38.389 --> 02:52:38.399 align:start position:0%
really if they're good guardians we you
 
02:52:41.030 --> 02:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
know we really want
 
02:52:42.790 --> 02:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
the children would be in and because the
 
02:52:44.389 --> 02:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
concern is the children the children
 
02:52:46.710 --> 02:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
will be in much better shape in this
 
02:52:49.269 --> 02:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
particular arrangement than other
 
02:52:49.279 --> 02:52:50.710 align:start position:0%
particular arrangement than other
alternatives

02:52:50.710 --> 02:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
02:52:52.429 --> 02:52:52.439 align:start position:0%
but an
 
02:52:56.469 --> 02:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
unspecific cost might be more
 
02:52:58.150 --> 02:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
than the guardian
 
02:53:00.630 --> 02:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
could bear and there's nothing in here
 
02:53:05.990 --> 02:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:07.590 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:53:09.429 --> 02:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if that's going to
 
02:53:12.309 --> 02:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
get in the way of a of a placement in
 
02:53:14.150 --> 02:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child can you
 
02:53:16.150 --> 02:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
reassure me
 
02:53:19.190 --> 02:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely so the home assessment of
 
02:53:21.190 --> 02:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
during the adoption process is eleven
 
02:53:23.910 --> 02:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and most agencies have a
 
02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:24.870 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and most agencies have a
waiver

02:53:24.870 --> 02:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
02:53:27.110 --> 02:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
that allow you to or excuse me a grant
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
that allow if you're a relative
 
02:53:32.389 --> 02:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
placement or provider that you can ask
 
02:53:34.630 --> 02:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
for that grant and it applies and you no
 
02:53:37.030 --> 02:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
longer have to pay for that luckily i
 
02:53:39.670 --> 02:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
was i fell under that grant so we didn't
 
02:53:41.429 --> 02:53:41.439 align:start position:0%
have to pay that eleven hundred dollars
 
02:53:45.190 --> 02:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
um i cannot speak to the agency
 
02:53:48.630 --> 02:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
or agencies as to what that cost will be
 
02:53:52.150 --> 02:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
but i do not expect to see an 1100 price
 
02:53:55.030 --> 02:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
tag for a brief report on whether a home
 
02:53:57.670 --> 02:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
is safe or not in discussions with those
 
02:53:57.680 --> 02:54:02.870 align:start position:0%
is safe or not in discussions with those
agencies

02:54:02.870 --> 02:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:05.190 --> 02:54:05.200 align:start position:0%

02:54:09.510 --> 02:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question it says here that a
 
02:54:11.349 --> 02:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
guardian shall file a report with the
 
02:54:13.429 --> 02:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
courts on behalf
 
02:54:17.110 --> 02:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
with the courts before each review date
 
02:54:19.510 --> 02:54:19.520 align:start position:0%

02:54:20.950 --> 02:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
that is going to be found say on the
 
02:54:22.630 --> 02:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
judicial um
 
02:54:25.030 --> 02:54:25.040 align:start position:0%

02:54:35.750 --> 02:54:35.760 align:start position:0%

02:54:54.070 --> 02:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:57.269 --> 02:54:57.279 align:start position:0%

representative long
 
02:54:59.279 --> 02:55:00.309 align:start position:0%
representative long
so

02:55:00.309 --> 02:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:02.790 --> 02:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
my ques my question is is on the grants
 
02:55:02.800 --> 02:55:05.269 align:start position:0%
my ques my question is is on the grants
uh

02:55:05.269 --> 02:55:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:07.269 --> 02:55:07.279 align:start position:0%
i know waypoint doesn't it's a thousand
 
02:55:10.469 --> 02:55:10.479 align:start position:0%
dollars um and they do have grants
 
02:55:12.469 --> 02:55:12.479 align:start position:0%
however they run out of grant money
 
02:55:12.479 --> 02:55:13.830 align:start position:0%
however they run out of grant money
early

02:55:13.830 --> 02:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
early
 
02:55:16.150 --> 02:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
because that's what people are going for
 
02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:17.269 align:start position:0%
because that's what people are going for
first

02:55:17.269 --> 02:55:17.279 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:55:18.950 --> 02:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh and this is
 
02:55:22.550 --> 02:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
this is requiring which i agree every
 
02:55:25.110 --> 02:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
every home should be safe and
 
02:55:26.790 --> 02:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
there ought to be a home
 
02:55:31.429 --> 02:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
a home uh a home safety visit um but
 
02:55:32.710 --> 02:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
i'm still
 
02:55:34.870 --> 02:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
battling with uh
 
02:55:36.790 --> 02:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
the cost to whom
 
02:55:40.469 --> 02:55:40.479 align:start position:0%
and when it's waived is there a cost to
 
02:55:42.630 --> 02:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
is there a cost at all
 
02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:43.590 align:start position:0%
is there a cost at all
so

02:55:43.590 --> 02:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:46.790 --> 02:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
the waiver is on the agencies
 
02:55:48.950 --> 02:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's to do the waiver
 
02:55:51.910 --> 02:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
okay it's not so who does pay
 
02:55:56.070 --> 02:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:58.630 --> 02:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
who who pays
 
02:56:01.910 --> 02:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
the agency does it for free is that it
 
02:56:04.469 --> 02:56:04.479 align:start position:0%
yeah it is okay so um
 
02:56:06.230 --> 02:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
when the
 
02:56:06.240 --> 02:56:07.269 align:start position:0%
when the
uh

02:56:07.269 --> 02:56:07.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:56:10.469 --> 02:56:10.479 align:start position:0%
home visit is waived um this is done at
 
02:56:13.510 --> 02:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch or so
 
02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:14.630 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch or so
that

02:56:14.630 --> 02:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:56:16.790 --> 02:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's that piece um
 
02:56:19.510 --> 02:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
if it's waived there's no cost because
 
02:56:21.190 --> 02:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
it's been waived you don't have to do it
 
02:56:22.550 --> 02:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's not a requirement
 
02:56:22.560 --> 02:56:23.990 align:start position:0%
it's not a requirement
um

02:56:23.990 --> 02:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:25.190 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:29.750 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:56:29.750 --> 02:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:31.510 --> 02:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
if it's waived it's no longer
 
02:56:32.710 --> 02:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
requirements so they're not paying for
 
02:56:33.910 --> 02:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
it in the first place so i think that
 
02:56:35.670 --> 02:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
answers your question right i get that
 
02:56:37.910 --> 02:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
yep follow up for me
 
02:56:41.349 --> 02:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
follow up uh so it says uh on 21 the
 
02:56:43.670 --> 02:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
home safety visit may be waived if the
 
02:56:46.389 --> 02:56:46.399 align:start position:0%
parent or parents give consent
 
02:56:50.070 --> 02:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:52.710 --> 02:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
well so now as we know in this committee
 
02:56:55.269 --> 02:56:55.279 align:start position:0%
not every situation and scenario is the
 
02:56:57.590 --> 02:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
same sometimes you may not be able to
 
02:57:00.070 --> 02:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
find said second parent which is why it
 
02:57:03.190 --> 02:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
says parent or parents so if a mom and
 
02:57:06.389 --> 02:57:06.399 align:start position:0%
dad agree then
 
02:57:07.590 --> 02:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
02:57:10.230 --> 02:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
but if you can't find dad and dad's not
 
02:57:11.750 --> 02:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
at the hearing
 
02:57:15.510 --> 02:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:17.190 --> 02:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why
 
02:57:19.750 --> 02:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
one parent can't speak for the other
 
02:57:21.429 --> 02:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
parent if the other parent decides they
 
02:57:22.950 --> 02:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to show up for a guardianship
 
02:57:25.510 --> 02:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
hearing that they may lose guardianship
 
02:57:28.230 --> 02:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
you follow up
 
02:57:31.830 --> 02:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
follow it so the scenario is if what if
 
02:57:33.910 --> 02:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
they're both there but they don't agree
 
02:57:38.550 --> 02:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:40.150 --> 02:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't yeah it doesn't say shao it
 
02:57:43.030 --> 02:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
says may um and if
 
02:57:45.349 --> 02:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
if they're both there and one of the
 
02:57:47.590 --> 02:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
parents agree then they're contesting
 
02:57:49.190 --> 02:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
the guardianship itself they're not
 
02:57:51.349 --> 02:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
contesting the home visit which is a
 
02:57:53.110 --> 02:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
different scenario in and of itself
 
02:57:54.950 --> 02:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
which means the waiver wouldn't apply in
 
02:57:56.710 --> 02:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
the first place okay
 
02:57:58.870 --> 02:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
but i'm thinking on the uh
 
02:58:00.550 --> 02:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up i make
 
02:58:03.510 --> 02:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you i'm thinking on the
 
02:58:05.510 --> 02:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
parental bill of rights that may goes
 
02:58:07.590 --> 02:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
into a shell
 
02:58:07.600 --> 02:58:12.309 align:start position:0%
into a shell
so

02:58:12.309 --> 02:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:14.710 --> 02:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
if i'm being yeah if i'm being fair
 
02:58:16.309 --> 02:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
those are two different bills and we're
 
02:58:18.630 --> 02:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
talking about this one here i i kind of
 
02:58:20.630 --> 02:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
get where you're going with that but um
 
02:58:22.309 --> 02:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
in the event that one or both parents
 
02:58:23.510 --> 02:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
were there
 
02:58:23.520 --> 02:58:24.309 align:start position:0%
were there
in

02:58:24.309 --> 02:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:58:26.870 --> 02:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
um in in a in a ref one of the
 
02:58:28.309 --> 02:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
references that we had suggested was
 
02:58:30.070 --> 02:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
that when parents are giving
 
02:58:33.030 --> 02:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
guardianship to grandparents or aunt and
 
02:58:33.040 --> 02:58:33.990 align:start position:0%
guardianship to grandparents or aunt and
uncles

02:58:33.990 --> 02:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
uncles
 
02:58:37.030 --> 02:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
and they're agreeing to the guardianship
 
02:58:40.070 --> 02:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
um that's where the waiver
 
02:58:43.349 --> 02:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
shall may right excuse me may be waived
 
02:58:45.590 --> 02:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
that the parent or parents are agreeing
 
02:58:47.349 --> 02:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
that this is the safe environment this
 
02:58:49.349 --> 02:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
is a place where the kiddos should go
 
02:58:51.030 --> 02:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
and we agree to that
 
02:58:52.469 --> 02:58:52.479 align:start position:0%
but if they're contesting as
 
02:58:54.790 --> 02:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
representative long had suggested
 
02:58:56.790 --> 02:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
one or both they're not contesting the
 
02:58:58.070 --> 02:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
visit they're contesting the
 
02:58:59.990 --> 02:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
guardianship and in its entirety and
 
02:59:01.830 --> 02:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
that is a different issue and that's
 
02:59:03.670 --> 02:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
what the you know
 
02:59:05.349 --> 02:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
that would be done
 
02:59:07.110 --> 02:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
if they're contesting the guardianship
 
02:59:08.870 --> 02:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's done prior to the guardianship
 
02:59:10.550 --> 02:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
being put in place
 
02:59:11.910 --> 02:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:59:13.750 --> 02:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion
 
02:59:15.750 --> 02:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
02:59:17.990 --> 02:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you again uh and i
 
02:59:21.590 --> 02:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
did find that area it wasn't taken out
 
02:59:23.910 --> 02:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
of part one it's still in your amendment
 
02:59:26.150 --> 02:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
if you look at nine li i mean uh line
 
02:59:28.150 --> 02:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
nine it says the guardian shall file a
 
02:59:30.870 --> 02:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
report with the court um on or before
 
02:59:32.950 --> 02:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
each review date a parent may file a
 
02:59:34.790 --> 02:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
statement or report with the court on or
 
02:59:36.870 --> 02:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
before each review date
 
02:59:39.510 --> 02:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
so my question again is what is this
 
02:59:42.070 --> 02:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
report where is it found i was a
 
02:59:44.070 --> 02:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
guardian for my daughter for seven years
 
02:59:47.349 --> 02:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
i had enough things i had to file and
 
02:59:49.590 --> 02:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
look at to be her guardian so i'm
 
02:59:52.230 --> 02:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
curious what this is what does it entail
 
02:59:52.240 --> 02:59:53.349 align:start position:0%
curious what this is what does it entail
and

02:59:53.349 --> 02:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:59:55.670 --> 02:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
does it have to be done this says
 
02:59:58.389 --> 02:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
could be reviewed every 6 12 or 24
 
03:00:00.950 --> 03:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
months so are you expecting a guardian
 
03:00:03.429 --> 03:00:03.439 align:start position:0%
to fill out this report and forward it
 
03:00:05.030 --> 03:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:00:07.429 --> 03:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
judicial branch i would imagine
 
03:00:09.349 --> 03:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
or finding the file there and then
 
03:00:11.830 --> 03:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
having to do that three times a year if
 
03:00:13.990 --> 03:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's requested the only thing that's
 
03:00:16.710 --> 03:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
being changed uh in the
 
03:00:20.790 --> 03:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
current statute is the bold print
 
03:00:23.750 --> 03:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
what you're reading is in the current
 
03:00:25.429 --> 03:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
current law
 
03:00:34.870 --> 03:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:39.990 --> 03:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:43.590 --> 03:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
i do understand what you're saying um
 
03:00:45.910 --> 03:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
i just wasn't aware of that part of it
 
03:00:48.790 --> 03:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
but my daughter also wasn't a minor
 
03:00:50.790 --> 03:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
03:00:53.750 --> 03:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
you're welcome madam chair if i may just
 
03:00:58.070 --> 03:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
briefly absolutely thank you so um
 
03:00:58.080 --> 03:00:58.950 align:start position:0%
briefly absolutely thank you so um
my

03:00:58.950 --> 03:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:01:01.830 --> 03:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
my guardianship was for a minor and you
 
03:01:03.750 --> 03:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
do have to fill out a six-month report
 
03:01:05.590 --> 03:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
and it's just a basic simple it's
 
03:01:07.269 --> 03:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
currently done right now in statute
 
03:01:08.550 --> 03:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
we're not changing that as the chair
 
03:01:09.990 --> 03:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
alluded to
 
03:01:13.510 --> 03:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
every 6 12 and 24 months and
 
03:01:15.269 --> 03:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
that's just to make sure that everything
 
03:01:17.670 --> 03:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
is going hunky-dory right that's it
 
03:01:20.070 --> 03:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
um and like i said it's already in the
 
03:01:22.389 --> 03:01:22.399 align:start position:0%
current statue um
 
03:01:23.910 --> 03:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
and that's just to make sure the
 
03:01:24.950 --> 03:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
guardians are doing what they're
 
03:01:26.950 --> 03:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to and being guardians of a
 
03:01:29.670 --> 03:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
child that's that is a minor um and i
 
03:01:31.429 --> 03:01:31.439 align:start position:0%
don't think it would apply to your case
 
03:01:33.990 --> 03:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
because this is strictly for this rsa
 
03:01:36.469 --> 03:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
and if your child if your child wasn't a
 
03:01:37.990 --> 03:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
minor then that wouldn't apply to that
 
03:01:43.349 --> 03:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:44.950 --> 03:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you anymore
 
03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:47.110 align:start position:0%

03:18:43.990 --> 03:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
be afraid to report abuse or engage with
 
03:18:46.550 --> 03:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
child protection service workers
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
victims may fear that cpsws will tell
 
03:18:51.830 --> 03:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
their partner or
 
03:18:53.910 --> 03:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
that what they say will get back to
 
03:18:56.870 --> 03:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
their abuser that they will be blamed or
 
03:18:59.510 --> 03:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
not believed or that their children will
 
03:19:01.830 --> 03:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
be taken away the ability to make
 
03:19:03.590 --> 03:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
anonymous reports
 
03:19:05.830 --> 03:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
ensures that they can get the help they
 
03:19:09.269 --> 03:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
need without placing their safety at
 
03:19:12.150 --> 03:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
further risk it also alleviates the
 
03:19:15.030 --> 03:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
barriers that victims need to overcome
 
03:19:17.510 --> 03:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
to get support
 
03:19:19.190 --> 03:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's correct and that's what this
 
03:19:22.710 --> 03:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
amendment speaks to is the fact that
 
03:19:24.790 --> 03:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
anybody who calls does have the
 
03:19:29.190 --> 03:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:31.110 --> 03:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
what i am
 
03:19:34.229 --> 03:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
what what is not anonymous is that
 
03:19:36.710 --> 03:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
the reports
 
03:19:38.790 --> 03:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
may include the name address or phone
 
03:19:40.550 --> 03:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
number of the person making their
 
03:19:43.030 --> 03:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
reports so their now
 
03:19:43.040 --> 03:19:44.229 align:start position:0%
reports so their now
is

03:19:44.229 --> 03:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:19:46.070 --> 03:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
well they may but if the person is
 
03:19:46.080 --> 03:19:47.269 align:start position:0%
well they may but if the person is
anonymous

03:19:47.269 --> 03:19:47.279 align:start position:0%
anonymous
 
03:19:49.190 --> 03:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative then they're anonymous
 
03:19:51.190 --> 03:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
and there'll be no name
 
03:19:57.349 --> 03:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:57.359 --> 03:19:58.309 align:start position:0%
 
being

03:19:58.309 --> 03:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
being
 
03:20:00.550 --> 03:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
with respect madam chair being able to
 
03:20:04.070 --> 03:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
make reports safely to dcyf regarding
 
03:20:06.469 --> 03:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
suspected or known child abuse
 
03:20:08.389 --> 03:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
is an important part of responding to
 
03:20:10.630 --> 03:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
and assisting families escape violence
 
03:20:13.030 --> 03:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
and abusive situations opening a door
 
03:20:14.469 --> 03:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
for a possible
 
03:20:16.790 --> 03:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
disclosure of name address or phone
 
03:20:16.800 --> 03:20:19.429 align:start position:0%
disclosure of name address or phone
number

03:20:19.429 --> 03:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:19.439 --> 03:20:20.790 align:start position:0%
 
is

03:20:20.790 --> 03:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:20:22.469 --> 03:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
again is
 
03:20:24.469 --> 03:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
a chilling way to
 
03:20:26.630 --> 03:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
put another barrier in front of victims
 
03:20:28.389 --> 03:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence
 
03:20:30.870 --> 03:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
i agree with you representative that it
 
03:20:32.229 --> 03:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
is chilling
 
03:20:35.510 --> 03:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
it is absolutely unnecessary
 
03:20:38.150 --> 03:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
in some cases and that's why the
 
03:20:40.710 --> 03:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
amendment removes
 
03:20:44.710 --> 03:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that a person would be required
 
03:20:47.030 --> 03:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
to give their name phone number address
 
03:20:52.229 --> 03:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:54.150 --> 03:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
03:20:57.910 --> 03:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
required it but not the amendment
 
03:20:59.750 --> 03:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
and we're speaking to the amendment i am
 
03:21:01.830 --> 03:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
speaking to the amendment on line 20 of
 
03:21:03.830 --> 03:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
03:21:05.510 --> 03:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
the department may inform the
 
03:21:05.520 --> 03:21:06.870 align:start position:0%
the department may inform the
complainant

03:21:06.870 --> 03:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
complainant
 
03:21:08.469 --> 03:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
that should the complaint be made
 
03:21:11.030 --> 03:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
maliciously or with intent to harm the
 
03:21:13.190 --> 03:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
complainant may be subject
 
03:21:16.469 --> 03:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
to criminal and civil civil penalties
 
03:21:18.950 --> 03:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
that is correct and that would only be
 
03:21:21.990 --> 03:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
in the case that the particular person
 
03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:23.309 align:start position:0%
in the case that the particular person
gave

03:21:23.309 --> 03:21:23.319 align:start position:0%
gave
 
03:21:26.630 --> 03:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
voluntarily their name
 
03:21:28.870 --> 03:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
if you don't give your name
 
03:21:33.670 --> 03:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:36.309 --> 03:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
with respect madam chair that's
 
03:21:38.070 --> 03:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
that's not how the system actually works
 
03:21:40.870 --> 03:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
in real life so
 
03:21:43.429 --> 03:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
they think that this this
 
03:21:46.150 --> 03:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
this sets up a barrier for
 
03:21:48.630 --> 03:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
people trying to access family violence
 
03:21:53.670 --> 03:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
prevention specialists in our state and
 
03:21:53.680 --> 03:21:55.110 align:start position:0%
prevention specialists in our state and
i

03:21:55.110 --> 03:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:21:55.120 --> 03:21:55.910 align:start position:0%
i
this

03:21:55.910 --> 03:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:21:55.920 --> 03:21:57.910 align:start position:0%
this
amendment

03:21:57.910 --> 03:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:22:00.950 --> 03:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
does not address those issues thank you
 
03:22:02.150 --> 03:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
any other
 
03:22:02.160 --> 03:22:05.190 align:start position:0%
any other
information

03:22:05.190 --> 03:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:08.389 --> 03:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative belanger
 
03:22:09.990 --> 03:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair for recognizing
 
03:22:12.309 --> 03:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
me and i just want to point out
 
03:22:13.510 --> 03:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:22:15.830 --> 03:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
i spoke with the bill's sponsor about my
 
03:22:18.229 --> 03:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
concerns about the initial bill in the
 
03:22:20.790 --> 03:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
first place and i am very happy that
 
03:22:22.870 --> 03:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment uh has come forward i
 
03:22:24.790 --> 03:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
think um one of the things that i said
 
03:22:27.990 --> 03:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
was uh it should be it shouldn't be a
 
03:22:30.309 --> 03:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
requirement to have to
 
03:22:32.229 --> 03:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
provide but that you should and i think
 
03:22:35.429 --> 03:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does so um
 
03:22:36.630 --> 03:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
it says the reports made to the
 
03:22:38.710 --> 03:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
department may include the name address
 
03:22:40.550 --> 03:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say it has to it doesn't say
 
03:22:43.510 --> 03:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
it shall it says it may um
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
and but and the department may inform
 
03:22:48.550 --> 03:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
the individual that if you are
 
03:22:51.910 --> 03:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
doing this on purpose um to be malicious
 
03:22:54.950 --> 03:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
right as it says um that you are subject
 
03:22:56.790 --> 03:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
to criminal and civil penalties i mean
 
03:22:59.830 --> 03:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
as somebody who has made reports um to
 
03:23:03.269 --> 03:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
dcyf i think this is a major step in the
 
03:23:05.670 --> 03:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
right direction um
 
03:23:07.590 --> 03:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
and uh i support the ought to pass
 
03:23:07.600 --> 03:23:09.269 align:start position:0%
and uh i support the ought to pass
motion

03:23:09.269 --> 03:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
motion
 
03:23:12.070 --> 03:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um i spoke with
 
03:23:12.080 --> 03:23:14.150 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um i spoke with
uh

03:23:14.150 --> 03:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:23:17.269 --> 03:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
the director joe ripsom yesterday
 
03:23:22.150 --> 03:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
concerning the amendment uh he was not
 
03:23:23.910 --> 03:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
on board with
 
03:23:26.309 --> 03:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
the bill itself but
 
03:23:28.389 --> 03:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
he said that the amendment made it
 
03:23:31.190 --> 03:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what it should be and he
 
03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
supported the amendment
 
03:23:35.990 --> 03:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore supported
 
03:23:39.110 --> 03:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
the otpa motion
 
03:23:39.120 --> 03:23:39.910 align:start position:0%
the otpa motion
so

03:23:39.910 --> 03:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:23:46.630 --> 03:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:48.309 --> 03:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
03:23:51.590 --> 03:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairs uh so in essence
 
03:23:56.550 --> 03:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
this has given dcyf the latitude
 
03:24:00.229 --> 03:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
of asking for a name on her on a
 
03:24:00.239 --> 03:24:01.269 align:start position:0%
of asking for a name on her on a
complaint

03:24:01.269 --> 03:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
03:24:04.790 --> 03:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:04.800 --> 03:24:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:24:05.510 --> 03:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:24:08.070 --> 03:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
sure absolutely we already have that now
 
03:24:10.870 --> 03:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
but it also gives the opportunity for
 
03:24:13.750 --> 03:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
the caller to say i choose not to give
 
03:24:17.110 --> 03:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
my name right without repercussions okay
 
03:24:18.870 --> 03:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you can i follow up on that one
 
03:24:21.429 --> 03:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
certainly so what i'm thinking is that
 
03:24:24.830 --> 03:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
down the road dcyf is going to know
 
03:24:27.510 --> 03:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
what complaints
 
03:24:29.110 --> 03:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
that they want
 
03:24:31.349 --> 03:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
to complain it because they're thinking
 
03:24:33.349 --> 03:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
maybe it's going to be false or maybe
 
03:24:35.830 --> 03:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
this person has done this before
 
03:24:38.790 --> 03:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
and it was a false complaint
 
03:24:41.830 --> 03:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
well i i can't answer to how a person
 
03:24:44.389 --> 03:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
who takes the call is going to think
 
03:24:45.990 --> 03:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
no it wasn't a question
 
03:24:47.190 --> 03:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:24:49.590 --> 03:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just thinking i i'm
 
03:24:52.229 --> 03:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking out loud
 
03:24:54.790 --> 03:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
i do that a lot um
 
03:24:54.800 --> 03:25:00.229 align:start position:0%
i do that a lot um
so

03:25:00.229 --> 03:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:02.229 --> 03:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean this be nice to ask mr
 
03:25:03.990 --> 03:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
ripson if
 
03:25:07.269 --> 03:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
it would be nice to have him here to
 
03:25:09.190 --> 03:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
you know because i
 
03:25:10.150 --> 03:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
i mean i
 
03:25:14.469 --> 03:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
it does give him the authority to
 
03:25:17.349 --> 03:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
ask a complainant uh
 
03:25:19.590 --> 03:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
for their identification that that's
 
03:25:21.510 --> 03:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's clear and i'm okay with that
 
03:25:23.190 --> 03:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
because they probably get a lot of calls
 
03:25:24.630 --> 03:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
from the same people and they can
 
03:25:26.790 --> 03:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
recognize the voice and they could ask
 
03:25:26.800 --> 03:25:27.990 align:start position:0%
recognize the voice and they could ask
that

03:25:27.990 --> 03:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:25:29.510 --> 03:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
can you give me your name
 
03:25:32.150 --> 03:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
and by the way false information could
 
03:25:34.070 --> 03:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
you you could be liable
 
03:25:37.590 --> 03:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
um but i'm but i'm trying to
 
03:25:40.229 --> 03:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to you know i i don't know if
 
03:25:44.710 --> 03:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
that's good practice for dcyf to
 
03:25:44.720 --> 03:25:52.950 align:start position:0%
that's good practice for dcyf to
um

03:25:52.950 --> 03:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:52.960 --> 03:25:57.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:25:57.349 --> 03:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:59.670 --> 03:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
with confidentiality
 
03:26:02.229 --> 03:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
it appears to be working i mean yeah
 
03:26:03.910 --> 03:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
people are putting in false claims
 
03:26:05.510 --> 03:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening so this is
 
03:26:07.510 --> 03:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
looking to fix that
 
03:26:09.990 --> 03:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure if this does
 
03:26:12.469 --> 03:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
um i and
 
03:26:14.950 --> 03:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
but i i lean without having mr ribson
 
03:26:17.349 --> 03:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
here i i lean towards
 
03:26:21.670 --> 03:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:24.429 --> 03:26:24.439 align:start position:0%
putting a strangle on the
 
03:26:28.469 --> 03:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:30.229 --> 03:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
because if i call in and i want to be
 
03:26:32.550 --> 03:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
confident i want to be caught financial
 
03:26:32.560 --> 03:26:33.910 align:start position:0%
confident i want to be caught financial
and

03:26:33.910 --> 03:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:26:35.990 --> 03:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'm being asked uh can you give me your
 
03:26:37.910 --> 03:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
name well i'd like to be confidential
 
03:26:40.070 --> 03:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay we're not taking your complaint so
 
03:26:44.550 --> 03:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i i i just have too many uh
 
03:26:44.560 --> 03:26:51.590 align:start position:0%
yeah i i i just have too many uh
i'm

03:26:51.590 --> 03:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:57.590 --> 03:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:59.830 --> 03:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
well it was my understanding in from the
 
03:26:59.840 --> 03:27:01.429 align:start position:0%
well it was my understanding in from the
testimony

03:27:01.429 --> 03:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:27:05.349 --> 03:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
from dhhs that they actually
 
03:27:07.750 --> 03:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
encourage people to give information so
 
03:27:09.990 --> 03:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
that they can follow up because the
 
03:27:12.150 --> 03:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
person doing the investigation isn't the
 
03:27:14.870 --> 03:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
person answering the phone and so they
 
03:27:18.309 --> 03:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
want to be able to get more information
 
03:27:20.150 --> 03:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
when they're doing the investigation and
 
03:27:23.750 --> 03:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
have more more time to investigate so
 
03:27:23.760 --> 03:27:24.790 align:start position:0%
have more more time to investigate so
they

03:27:24.790 --> 03:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:27:26.469 --> 03:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
prefer people to
 
03:27:28.550 --> 03:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
give that information and not do it
 
03:27:31.990 --> 03:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
anonymously do it confidentially and
 
03:27:34.790 --> 03:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
um so there is
 
03:27:36.870 --> 03:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
um already a practice of trying to get
 
03:27:38.550 --> 03:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
that information so that that the
 
03:27:40.870 --> 03:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
investigator could follow up and so this
 
03:27:44.150 --> 03:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
is not this is um the proposed bill
 
03:27:45.990 --> 03:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
proposed to change that and this
 
03:27:48.630 --> 03:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
amendment is going back to the may
 
03:27:48.640 --> 03:27:49.590 align:start position:0%
amendment is going back to the may
uh

03:27:49.590 --> 03:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:27:52.309 --> 03:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
may collect that information option
 
03:27:52.319 --> 03:27:53.910 align:start position:0%
may collect that information option
and

03:27:53.910 --> 03:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:27:57.190 --> 03:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
it that that is currently practiced
 
03:27:58.309 --> 03:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:27:58.319 --> 03:27:59.269 align:start position:0%
and so
um

03:27:59.269 --> 03:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:59.279 --> 03:27:59.550 align:start position:0%
um
there

03:27:59.550 --> 03:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:27:59.560 --> 03:28:00.710 align:start position:0%
there
[Music]

03:28:00.710 --> 03:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:28:03.670 --> 03:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
is when we get to the rest of the bill
 
03:28:06.630 --> 03:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
um that is not changed by this amendment
 
03:28:06.640 --> 03:28:08.389 align:start position:0%
um that is not changed by this amendment
uh

03:28:08.389 --> 03:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:28:12.070 --> 03:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
the the the um i think some of the
 
03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
concerns as far as releasing the names
 
03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
of confidentiality will is is addressed
 
03:28:21.349 --> 03:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
in the um
 
03:28:24.710 --> 03:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
the actual bill and not a subject of
 
03:28:26.309 --> 03:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
this amendment so i don't want to speak
 
03:28:29.030 --> 03:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
to it because that would be not not
 
03:28:34.070 --> 03:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:34.080 --> 03:28:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:28:35.030 --> 03:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:28:37.190 --> 03:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
this is completely allowing for
 
03:28:38.790 --> 03:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
anonymous reporting confidential
 
03:28:42.469 --> 03:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
reporting just as as um
 
03:28:44.710 --> 03:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
is the practice now so this
 
03:28:49.190 --> 03:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
is more pulling back this the the um
 
03:28:51.990 --> 03:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
the step for the gal and the requirement
 
03:28:55.670 --> 03:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
that it own that eliminated the conf the
 
03:28:57.990 --> 03:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
anonymous reporting and so it's pulling
 
03:29:00.550 --> 03:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
back those and still leaving the rest of
 
03:29:03.190 --> 03:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:06.389 --> 03:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
in place and so um i think that is
 
03:29:10.070 --> 03:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
the goal of this amendment so thank you
 
03:29:11.349 --> 03:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:29:11.359 --> 03:29:13.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

03:29:13.030 --> 03:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:29:15.590 --> 03:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
petrino thank you i'll be honest i'm a
 
03:29:18.389 --> 03:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
little confused because if i'm going to
 
03:29:22.070 --> 03:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
call dcyf and give a false report
 
03:29:23.910 --> 03:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
and then the person on the other end of
 
03:29:25.590 --> 03:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
the phone says to me
 
03:29:26.870 --> 03:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
would you like to
 
03:29:28.870 --> 03:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
give your name and address sir
 
03:29:30.229 --> 03:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say no
 
03:29:32.950 --> 03:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
so i don't know why we need this
 
03:29:32.960 --> 03:29:34.630 align:start position:0%
so i don't know why we need this
because

03:29:34.630 --> 03:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:29:36.710 --> 03:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any sense
 
03:29:39.590 --> 03:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative al tiller
 
03:29:43.910 --> 03:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:47.349 --> 03:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire everybody
 
03:29:49.750 --> 03:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
over the age of 18
 
03:29:53.990 --> 03:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
is a mandated reporter for any suspicion
 
03:29:55.110 --> 03:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
of child
 
03:29:57.590 --> 03:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
child abuse or neglect
 
03:30:00.870 --> 03:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
every person over the age of 18
 
03:30:03.830 --> 03:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
is a mandatory reporter and we have
 
03:30:05.830 --> 03:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
created an environment in new hampshire
 
03:30:10.229 --> 03:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:12.309 --> 03:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
to be able
 
03:30:15.190 --> 03:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
to get help to children
 
03:30:18.229 --> 03:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
when they are experiencing abuse or
 
03:30:20.950 --> 03:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
neglect and one of the things that has
 
03:30:23.510 --> 03:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
helped us is being able to make
 
03:30:26.550 --> 03:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
anonymous reports because
 
03:30:27.830 --> 03:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
we know
 
03:30:27.840 --> 03:30:29.110 align:start position:0%
we know
that

03:30:29.110 --> 03:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:30:32.070 --> 03:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
retaliation for making reports is a
 
03:30:34.070 --> 03:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
significant fear
 
03:30:34.080 --> 03:30:35.990 align:start position:0%
significant fear
for

03:30:35.990 --> 03:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:30:37.830 --> 03:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
family members who may be witnessing
 
03:30:39.429 --> 03:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
abuse within their family it's a
 
03:30:42.229 --> 03:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
significant barrier and fear for
 
03:30:42.239 --> 03:30:43.269 align:start position:0%
significant barrier and fear for
neighbors

03:30:43.269 --> 03:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
who want to make a report but genuinely
 
03:30:50.389 --> 03:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
fear retaliation from their neighbors
 
03:30:53.910 --> 03:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:53.920 --> 03:30:55.670 align:start position:0%
 
putting

03:30:55.670 --> 03:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
putting
 
03:30:58.710 --> 03:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
changing our statute
 
03:30:58.720 --> 03:31:00.389 align:start position:0%
changing our statute
that

03:31:00.389 --> 03:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:31:03.590 --> 03:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
instead of it being child first it's now
 
03:31:06.630 --> 03:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
becoming reporter first or
 
03:31:09.110 --> 03:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
possible abuser first
 
03:31:11.910 --> 03:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
i think is unnecessary first of all and
 
03:31:13.750 --> 03:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
actually hurtful
 
03:31:16.950 --> 03:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
we know that when a report comes in
 
03:31:16.960 --> 03:31:17.750 align:start position:0%
we know that when a report comes in
that

03:31:17.750 --> 03:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:31:20.469 --> 03:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
a child protection worker is dispatched
 
03:31:23.830 --> 03:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
to do a minimal facts interview
 
03:31:27.269 --> 03:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
and during that minimal facts interview
 
03:31:29.590 --> 03:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
some of this information can be gleaned
 
03:31:29.600 --> 03:31:30.950 align:start position:0%
some of this information can be gleaned
if

03:31:30.950 --> 03:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:31:33.990 --> 03:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
if as a neighbor i make a report and i
 
03:31:35.990 --> 03:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
want to make an anonymous report because
 
03:31:38.830 --> 03:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
i genuinely fear retaliation from my
 
03:31:41.830 --> 03:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
neighbor and
 
03:31:44.550 --> 03:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
the librarian makes a report
 
03:31:48.550 --> 03:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
and a teacher makes a report
 
03:31:50.710 --> 03:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
that's three reports and we have been
 
03:31:53.910 --> 03:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
encouraging that kind of activism in the
 
03:31:56.469 --> 03:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire to help
 
03:31:58.870 --> 03:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
children and we aren't even getting to
 
03:32:01.110 --> 03:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
all of them because our child advocacy
 
03:32:05.190 --> 03:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
centers are absolutely overwhelmed
 
03:32:05.200 --> 03:32:06.550 align:start position:0%
centers are absolutely overwhelmed
with

03:32:06.550 --> 03:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:32:08.469 --> 03:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
these forensic interviews for children
 
03:32:10.950 --> 03:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
that are being abused and neglected we
 
03:32:13.510 --> 03:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
can't get to all these kids we don't
 
03:32:15.830 --> 03:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough people right now
 
03:32:18.469 --> 03:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
and we're now putting in a barrier for
 
03:32:23.269 --> 03:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
people to be able to make that report um
 
03:32:26.790 --> 03:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
if there is an impression that you will
 
03:32:30.150 --> 03:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
have to leave your name or that perhaps
 
03:32:32.710 --> 03:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
if you don't leave your name your
 
03:32:34.870 --> 03:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
your report will not be
 
03:32:38.710 --> 03:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
handled with the same seriousness that
 
03:32:41.429 --> 03:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
another report is
 
03:32:41.439 --> 03:32:42.710 align:start position:0%
another report is
then

03:32:42.710 --> 03:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:32:45.269 --> 03:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're slowing down and we
 
03:32:47.110 --> 03:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
are silencing
 
03:32:52.309 --> 03:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
the very people we need to speak up um i
 
03:32:54.389 --> 03:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
having just seen this
 
03:32:54.399 --> 03:32:55.750 align:start position:0%
having just seen this
amendment

03:32:55.750 --> 03:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:32:59.349 --> 03:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:01.910 --> 03:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
i think that it
 
03:33:04.150 --> 03:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
it creates an environment where people
 
03:33:07.269 --> 03:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
will believe that it's a default to give
 
03:33:09.510 --> 03:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
the name and that is not what we want in
 
03:33:12.229 --> 03:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
this state at all we want as many people
 
03:33:15.030 --> 03:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
as possible to speak out on behalf of
 
03:33:15.040 --> 03:33:18.950 align:start position:0%
as possible to speak out on behalf of
children

03:33:18.950 --> 03:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:20.710 --> 03:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:33:22.150 --> 03:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
any further representative long
 
03:33:27.670 --> 03:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'll be quick
 
03:33:29.510 --> 03:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering what my liability will be
 
03:33:30.550 --> 03:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
if i
 
03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
am mandatory to report so i called to
 
03:33:34.550 --> 03:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
report they asked me for my name and i
 
03:33:36.630 --> 03:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
say i'd rather be confidential
 
03:33:38.550 --> 03:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
so they're not going to take my report
 
03:33:40.309 --> 03:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming right is that what this
 
03:33:40.319 --> 03:33:43.429 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming right is that what this
says

03:33:43.429 --> 03:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:51.190 --> 03:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:53.990 --> 03:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
is ever going to say that you're a dumb
 
03:33:54.000 --> 03:33:55.030 align:start position:0%
is ever going to say that you're a dumb
person

03:33:55.030 --> 03:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:34:07.990 --> 03:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:10.070 --> 03:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
03:34:12.630 --> 03:34:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i can only
 
03:34:16.070 --> 03:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
speak to what happened to me when
 
03:34:18.790 --> 03:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
my dcyf call went in
 
03:34:21.910 --> 03:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
they gave their information and dcyf
 
03:34:24.070 --> 03:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
would not give me the information on who
 
03:34:27.510 --> 03:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
called i figured it out on my own but
 
03:34:28.870 --> 03:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
they never told me any of the
 
03:34:31.750 --> 03:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
information so yes you may give your
 
03:34:34.870 --> 03:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
name you may give your name
 
03:34:37.510 --> 03:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean that the person
 
03:34:38.630 --> 03:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
that is
 
03:34:41.110 --> 03:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh being complained about is gonna ever
 
03:34:43.190 --> 03:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
know who called
 
03:34:45.429 --> 03:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
they may figure it out like i did but
 
03:34:47.510 --> 03:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a concrete
 
03:34:51.670 --> 03:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:57.670 --> 03:34:57.680 align:start position:0%

pursuant to rsa
 
03:36:52.950 --> 03:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh 169c colon 9
 
03:36:56.070 --> 03:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
be released and so speaking uh
 
03:36:59.349 --> 03:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
so that is specifically stated the the
 
03:36:59.359 --> 03:37:00.389 align:start position:0%
so that is specifically stated the the
um

03:37:00.389 --> 03:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:03.750 --> 03:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
it should not be released um and will be
 
03:37:06.150 --> 03:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
kept confidential
 
03:37:06.160 --> 03:37:07.269 align:start position:0%
kept confidential
and

03:37:07.269 --> 03:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:37:07.279 --> 03:37:09.110 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:37:09.110 --> 03:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:13.910 --> 03:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:16.229 --> 03:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill mainly now that
 
03:37:18.870 --> 03:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's amended just instead of
 
03:37:20.469 --> 03:37:20.479 align:start position:0%
changing the
 
03:37:20.479 --> 03:37:21.990 align:start position:0%
changing the
the

03:37:21.990 --> 03:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:37:25.990 --> 03:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
the require the ch change from anonymous
 
03:37:26.000 --> 03:37:27.190 align:start position:0%
the require the ch change from anonymous
possible

03:37:27.190 --> 03:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
possible
 
03:37:29.750 --> 03:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
to not anonymous possible now that that
 
03:37:32.550 --> 03:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
is removed the only thing really that
 
03:37:35.510 --> 03:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
this bill does is ensures
 
03:37:37.429 --> 03:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
uh it adds
 
03:37:39.590 --> 03:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh new hampshire to one of the states
 
03:37:41.510 --> 03:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
that actually has a penalty
 
03:37:45.510 --> 03:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
for for uh not doing
 
03:37:45.520 --> 03:37:46.630 align:start position:0%
for for uh not doing
uh

03:37:46.630 --> 03:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:37:50.070 --> 03:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
a report in good faith and so
 
03:37:53.110 --> 03:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
i believe that that is important even
 
03:37:54.870 --> 03:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
though we're we're saying we're asking
 
03:37:58.309 --> 03:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
them to do it in good faith um
 
03:38:00.389 --> 03:38:00.399 align:start position:0%
having a pen a
 
03:38:02.950 --> 03:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
rule that says that they shouldn't they
 
03:38:06.550 --> 03:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be making false or suspect um
 
03:38:08.710 --> 03:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
making false statements
 
03:38:10.950 --> 03:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
um and that there's there's a penalty on
 
03:38:13.590 --> 03:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
the books for that i think that is a
 
03:38:15.590 --> 03:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
value and hopefully will
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
deter even those people that still have
 
03:38:19.510 --> 03:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
the option to
 
03:38:21.830 --> 03:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
make that false report anonymous and
 
03:38:24.070 --> 03:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
just hope that no one investigates and
 
03:38:26.469 --> 03:38:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh and finds out who they are
 
03:38:26.479 --> 03:38:28.229 align:start position:0%
uh and finds out who they are
um

03:38:28.229 --> 03:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:30.229 --> 03:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
will be dissuaded from making those
 
03:38:32.790 --> 03:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
false reports so thank you and i
 
03:38:34.710 --> 03:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
i hope that everyone will support this
 
03:38:41.269 --> 03:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:43.590 --> 03:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative your keller
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
representative also you have a comment
 
03:38:48.950 --> 03:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
or question
 
03:38:51.590 --> 03:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i have a comment
 
03:38:53.670 --> 03:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
with relation to um the vote we're about
 
03:38:59.670 --> 03:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:04.630 --> 03:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:06.630 --> 03:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
i would i would like to think that this
 
03:39:09.429 --> 03:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
all is made in good faith to protect
 
03:39:09.439 --> 03:39:10.389 align:start position:0%
all is made in good faith to protect
people

03:39:10.389 --> 03:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:39:13.110 --> 03:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
um but i don't i don't see it i see it
 
03:39:16.150 --> 03:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
actually being a deterrent for people to
 
03:39:19.750 --> 03:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
make complaints because our statute says
 
03:39:23.030 --> 03:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
anyone over the 18 who suspects
 
03:39:27.030 --> 03:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
just suspects that there is child abuse
 
03:39:28.469 --> 03:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
or neglect
 
03:39:31.349 --> 03:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
is mandated to make a report and the
 
03:39:34.630 --> 03:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
reason we do that is because one person
 
03:39:36.950 --> 03:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
may see a little bit and another person
 
03:39:39.510 --> 03:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
may see a little bit and altogether we
 
03:39:44.229 --> 03:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:46.469 --> 03:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
if we throw
 
03:39:49.189 --> 03:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
this this
 
03:39:51.269 --> 03:39:51.279 align:start position:0%
amendment in this
 
03:39:53.189 --> 03:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
i think creates a barrier where people
 
03:39:58.389 --> 03:39:58.399 align:start position:0%
will have to will really reconsider
 
03:40:00.950 --> 03:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
whether they make a complaint or not
 
03:40:04.550 --> 03:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
um because they will feel as if they
 
03:40:07.510 --> 03:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
will have to have investigated and have
 
03:40:07.520 --> 03:40:08.469 align:start position:0%
will have to have investigated and have
a

03:40:08.469 --> 03:40:08.479 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:40:11.030 --> 03:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
um provable conclusion to even make a
 
03:40:12.950 --> 03:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
report and that's not the intention
 
03:40:15.910 --> 03:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
that's not the intention of our child
 
03:40:19.110 --> 03:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
reporting laws and and there is actually
 
03:40:21.269 --> 03:40:21.279 align:start position:0%
while you can make an anonymous report
 
03:40:24.469 --> 03:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
if a case goes to trial all that comes
 
03:40:26.070 --> 03:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
out in discovery
 
03:40:29.990 --> 03:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
all of that comes out in discovery so
 
03:40:32.150 --> 03:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
this is this is setting up a barrier
 
03:40:33.830 --> 03:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
like wait
 
03:40:37.189 --> 03:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
before you go any further just so you
 
03:40:37.199 --> 03:40:38.070 align:start position:0%
before you go any further just so you
know

03:40:38.070 --> 03:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:40:40.630 --> 03:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
you might be prosecuted
 
03:40:40.640 --> 03:40:41.830 align:start position:0%
you might be prosecuted
um

03:40:41.830 --> 03:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:44.309 --> 03:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
criminally or civilly from making this
 
03:40:44.319 --> 03:40:45.590 align:start position:0%
criminally or civilly from making this
complaint

03:40:45.590 --> 03:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
03:40:49.110 --> 03:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
or for doing for giving this report
 
03:40:50.469 --> 03:40:50.479 align:start position:0%
and with
 
03:40:52.790 --> 03:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
one in three
 
03:40:55.269 --> 03:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
women in new hampshire experiencing
 
03:40:56.790 --> 03:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
sexual violence
 
03:41:00.469 --> 03:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
and the majority nearly 80 percent of
 
03:41:00.479 --> 03:41:01.510 align:start position:0%
and the majority nearly 80 percent of
them

03:41:01.510 --> 03:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:41:03.990 --> 03:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
before they turn 21
 
03:41:06.710 --> 03:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
we don't need any barriers
 
03:41:08.309 --> 03:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
any barriers
 
03:41:11.830 --> 03:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
at all perceived or otherwise to report
 
03:41:13.269 --> 03:41:13.279 align:start position:0%
child abuse
 
03:41:17.510 --> 03:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
i think this is unnecessary and actually
 
03:41:23.750 --> 03:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
will hurt the process
 
03:41:28.389 --> 03:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
so i encourage my colleagues to vote no
 
03:41:31.510 --> 03:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
and to not hamper the already very
 
03:41:33.990 --> 03:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
difficult work that our department of
 
03:41:39.670 --> 03:41:39.680 align:start position:0%

am concerned
 
03:47:15.750 --> 03:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
about how we balance the right of

about how we balance the right of
privacy

03:47:17.110 --> 03:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
03:47:20.550 --> 03:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
for the detainee
 
03:47:24.070 --> 03:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
with our obligation to be sure
 
03:47:27.830 --> 03:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
that the detainee is not being subjected
 
03:47:30.830 --> 03:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
to inappropriate
 
03:47:34.630 --> 03:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
behavior in a location in the facility
 
03:47:38.710 --> 03:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
other than those specified in the bill
 
03:47:40.469 --> 03:47:40.479 align:start position:0%
and can you
 
03:47:41.750 --> 03:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
help me
 
03:47:44.550 --> 03:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
see my way to vote
 
03:47:48.070 --> 03:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:50.150 --> 03:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative yokel would you like to
 
03:47:53.429 --> 03:47:53.439 align:start position:0%
respond yes thank you so
 
03:47:54.870 --> 03:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:47:58.950 --> 03:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
in the in the bill it says that
 
03:48:00.389 --> 03:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:48:02.790 --> 03:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
activity in all common areas shall be
 
03:48:04.790 --> 03:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
recorded and
 
03:48:07.590 --> 03:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
it said areas requiring
 
03:48:09.910 --> 03:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
privacy pursuant to state and federal
 
03:48:12.150 --> 03:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
law or regulation cell be exempt from
 
03:48:13.830 --> 03:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
this recording
 
03:48:15.590 --> 03:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
obligation so we're recording everywhere
 
03:48:17.830 --> 03:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
that we're allowed to record
 
03:48:19.110 --> 03:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:48:19.120 --> 03:48:19.910 align:start position:0%
and so
um

03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:21.590 --> 03:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
if something is happening in those
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
places that we're not allowed to record
 
03:48:23.520 --> 03:48:24.710 align:start position:0%
places that we're not allowed to record
obviously

03:48:24.710 --> 03:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
03:48:28.389 --> 03:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
um that is still a concern but
 
03:48:28.399 --> 03:48:29.349 align:start position:0%
um that is still a concern but
it

03:48:29.349 --> 03:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:48:31.349 --> 03:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
would need to be addressed elsewhere
 
03:48:33.269 --> 03:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
where and if that was then repealed then
 
03:48:36.150 --> 03:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
this automatically would um be reflected
 
03:48:38.150 --> 03:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
in this bill because they would be no
 
03:48:40.150 --> 03:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
longer required by those state or
 
03:48:42.070 --> 03:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
federal laws that those areas were
 
03:48:42.080 --> 03:48:49.110 align:start position:0%
federal laws that those areas were
protected

03:48:49.110 --> 03:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:50.950 --> 03:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um yeah i i like
 
03:48:56.150 --> 03:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
the concept of this i want to see it
 
03:48:56.160 --> 03:48:58.710 align:start position:0%
the concept of this i want to see it
work

03:48:58.710 --> 03:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:01.189 --> 03:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
but i question each facility paid for in
 
03:49:05.189 --> 03:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:06.870 --> 03:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
so that would be the manchester police
 
03:49:09.349 --> 03:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
station would be required
 
03:49:11.830 --> 03:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
when they're dealing with a child to
 
03:49:13.830 --> 03:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
have a recording
 
03:49:13.840 --> 03:49:15.349 align:start position:0%
have a recording
um

03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:15.359 --> 03:49:15.990 align:start position:0%
um
i

03:49:15.990 --> 03:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:49:17.750 --> 03:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
i just
 
03:49:19.830 --> 03:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
want to be clear on that correct because
 
03:49:22.229 --> 03:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's because they do get some state
 
03:49:25.349 --> 03:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
funding for different programs juvenile
 
03:49:27.590 --> 03:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
and adults
 
03:49:27.600 --> 03:49:29.429 align:start position:0%
and adults
so

03:49:29.429 --> 03:49:29.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:32.469 --> 03:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
and with respect to uh i i did ask the
 
03:49:36.070 --> 03:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
question to representative uh edwards
 
03:49:37.910 --> 03:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh and he did say that it was new
 
03:49:41.349 --> 03:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire specific only but i didn't see
 
03:49:41.359 --> 03:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire specific only but i didn't see
where

03:49:41.760 --> 03:49:41.770 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:49:41.770 --> 03:49:43.110 align:start position:0%
where
[Music]

03:49:43.110 --> 03:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:49:43.120 --> 03:49:45.830 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

03:49:45.830 --> 03:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:46.870 --> 03:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know because i'm thinking of a
 
03:49:48.070 --> 03:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
03:49:49.990 --> 03:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
secure setting we don't have
 
03:49:52.550 --> 03:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
you know we we often run out of it
 
03:49:55.429 --> 03:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
rooms here uh and they're sent elsewhere
 
03:49:58.070 --> 03:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
they're they are detained
 
03:49:58.080 --> 03:50:00.469 align:start position:0%
they're they are detained
um

03:50:00.469 --> 03:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:03.990 --> 03:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
they are secured and detained
 
03:50:06.309 --> 03:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
uh so but he did say that it was new
 
03:50:08.950 --> 03:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire only i don't see
 
03:50:10.710 --> 03:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
where it says new hampshire only in here
 
03:50:11.750 --> 03:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
but i
 
03:50:13.990 --> 03:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
i did ask him and he did say this is
 
03:50:16.229 --> 03:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
specific to new hampshire only
 
03:50:16.239 --> 03:50:18.830 align:start position:0%
specific to new hampshire only
so

03:50:18.830 --> 03:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative yo caleb
 
03:50:23.510 --> 03:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:50:26.469 --> 03:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
so mental health treatment uh
 
03:50:28.070 --> 03:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
unless it's
 
03:50:28.080 --> 03:50:29.429 align:start position:0%
unless it's
um

03:50:29.429 --> 03:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:30.630 --> 03:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
is not
 
03:50:30.640 --> 03:50:32.150 align:start position:0%
is not
um

03:50:32.150 --> 03:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:32.160 --> 03:50:33.670 align:start position:0%
um
detaining

03:50:33.670 --> 03:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
detaining
 
03:50:33.680 --> 03:50:34.710 align:start position:0%
detaining
someone

03:50:34.710 --> 03:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
someone
 
03:50:37.110 --> 03:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
um if they're if they're in need of
 
03:50:39.750 --> 03:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
treatment and the reason
 
03:50:42.389 --> 03:50:42.399 align:start position:0%
as was uh
 
03:50:46.150 --> 03:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
expressed by the dhhs commissioner was
 
03:50:49.429 --> 03:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
that there is no detention happening out
 
03:50:50.469 --> 03:50:50.479 align:start position:0%
of state
 
03:50:50.479 --> 03:50:51.990 align:start position:0%
of state
um

03:50:51.990 --> 03:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:53.590 --> 03:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
so there is
 
03:50:55.670 --> 03:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh that doesn't mean that people aren't
 
03:50:57.910 --> 03:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
receiving services out of state but the
 
03:51:00.309 --> 03:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
detention is not happening out of state
 
03:51:01.349 --> 03:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:51:04.389 --> 03:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
it isn't specifically stated in the bill
 
03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
that it's only new hampshire but it is
 
03:51:11.750 --> 03:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
in practice because that's where our our
 
03:51:11.760 --> 03:51:12.469 align:start position:0%
in practice because that's where our our
uh

03:51:12.469 --> 03:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:51:16.550 --> 03:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
detention our secured attention is
 
03:51:19.110 --> 03:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
that it would only be in the state
 
03:51:20.790 --> 03:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
right but if we
 
03:51:23.830 --> 03:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
in the future contracted with someone to
 
03:51:26.229 --> 03:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
do an out of state then we would need to
 
03:51:29.189 --> 03:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
ensure that that
 
03:51:31.110 --> 03:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
that they are
 
03:51:31.120 --> 03:51:31.990 align:start position:0%
that they are
um

03:51:31.990 --> 03:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:32.000 --> 03:51:33.830 align:start position:0%
um
uh

03:51:33.830 --> 03:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:51:35.670 --> 03:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
capable of of
 
03:51:35.680 --> 03:51:36.950 align:start position:0%
capable of of
uh

03:51:36.950 --> 03:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:51:39.189 --> 03:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
providing the protections that we're
 
03:51:40.550 --> 03:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
trying to give
 
03:51:44.389 --> 03:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
i believe in this in this statute
 
03:51:47.269 --> 03:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up for second so so
 
03:51:49.189 --> 03:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
your statement is saying that
 
03:51:51.750 --> 03:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of dhhs
 
03:51:54.469 --> 03:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
is saying that there is no one detained
 
03:51:58.950 --> 03:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:02.389 --> 03:52:02.399 align:start position:0%
that was his testimony the commissioner
 
03:52:04.550 --> 03:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
03:52:07.189 --> 03:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
no it was the um
 
03:52:09.750 --> 03:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:10.790 --> 03:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
rips him
 
03:52:10.800 --> 03:52:25.269 align:start position:0%
rips him
commissioner

03:52:25.269 --> 03:52:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:27.590 --> 03:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative also
 
03:52:29.750 --> 03:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:52:32.550 --> 03:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
so um i need to i need to clarify
 
03:52:35.349 --> 03:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of
 
03:52:37.189 --> 03:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a little bit of a
 
03:52:37.199 --> 03:52:39.670 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a little bit of a
miscommunication

03:52:39.670 --> 03:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
miscommunication
 
03:52:41.830 --> 03:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
we have children
 
03:52:44.389 --> 03:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
who are out of state
 
03:52:47.269 --> 03:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
we have children in massachusetts we
 
03:52:50.150 --> 03:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
have children in vermont we have
 
03:52:52.550 --> 03:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
children in florida we have children in
 
03:52:55.510 --> 03:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
wisconsin who are all placed out of
 
03:52:57.990 --> 03:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
state for
 
03:53:00.630 --> 03:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
various reasons not the least of which
 
03:53:02.389 --> 03:53:02.399 align:start position:0%
is that new hampshire cannot meet their
 
03:53:02.399 --> 03:53:04.070 align:start position:0%
is that new hampshire cannot meet their
needs

03:53:04.070 --> 03:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
needs
 
03:53:07.349 --> 03:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
when those children come in contact
 
03:53:09.750 --> 03:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
with juvenile justice
 
03:53:12.229 --> 03:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
in the state they are in
 
03:53:14.229 --> 03:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
they're still our kids we're still
 
03:53:15.910 --> 03:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
paying for them
 
03:53:18.550 --> 03:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
and we cannot legislate what another
 
03:53:20.630 --> 03:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
state does
 
03:53:23.590 --> 03:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
with their juvenile justice procedures
 
03:53:25.269 --> 03:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
and i fear
 
03:53:28.389 --> 03:53:28.399 align:start position:0%
while i don't dislike the intent of this
 
03:53:30.389 --> 03:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
bill as a matter of fact i think it's a
 
03:53:33.510 --> 03:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
really great idea but what this
 
03:53:36.070 --> 03:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
this does not
 
03:53:39.670 --> 03:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
this will set us up for
 
03:53:39.680 --> 03:53:40.950 align:start position:0%
this will set us up for
parents

03:53:40.950 --> 03:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
parents
 
03:53:42.870 --> 03:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire parents whose children are
 
03:53:44.550 --> 03:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
placed out of state
 
03:53:45.830 --> 03:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:53:48.150 --> 03:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
have encounters with the juvenile
 
03:53:51.910 --> 03:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
justice system of the state they're in
 
03:53:53.750 --> 03:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
now parents are saying well it's a new
 
03:53:55.429 --> 03:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire kid being paid for with new
 
03:53:58.469 --> 03:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire money i want that recording
 
03:54:00.710 --> 03:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
and we can't compel the state of
 
03:54:02.469 --> 03:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
massachusetts to do that nor can we
 
03:54:05.510 --> 03:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
compel wisconsin or florida or vermont
 
03:54:05.520 --> 03:54:07.349 align:start position:0%
compel wisconsin or florida or vermont
so

03:54:07.349 --> 03:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:54:09.910 --> 03:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
i i think that there's a big gap here
 
03:54:13.269 --> 03:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
that is actually a problem in the making
 
03:54:15.030 --> 03:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
and like i said
 
03:54:16.469 --> 03:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
if this were
 
03:54:19.189 --> 03:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire specific i'm all about it
 
03:54:21.030 --> 03:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
but it's not
 
03:54:25.269 --> 03:54:25.279 align:start position:0%
and so we are opening a window for
 
03:54:29.429 --> 03:54:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:31.670 --> 03:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
not the least of which are the parents
 
03:54:33.590 --> 03:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
who are very very and there are a lot of
 
03:54:34.950 --> 03:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
them who are very upset that their
 
03:54:37.030 --> 03:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
children are placed out of state they
 
03:54:40.070 --> 03:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
want their kids in state and this
 
03:54:43.110 --> 03:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
because we can't meet this statute
 
03:54:45.110 --> 03:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
would actually end up giving them a
 
03:54:47.189 --> 03:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
really good case for bringing them in
 
03:54:48.950 --> 03:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
and we can't meet those kids needs right
 
03:54:51.750 --> 03:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
now so i just want to put that out there
 
03:54:53.429 --> 03:54:53.439 align:start position:0%
not against this bill
 
03:54:55.349 --> 03:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
in its intention and i think it's made
 
03:54:58.790 --> 03:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
when in good faith there's a big gap
 
03:55:01.429 --> 03:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ukela
 
03:55:03.910 --> 03:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for recognizing me and in
 
03:55:06.229 --> 03:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
response to the previous speaker um it
 
03:55:09.030 --> 03:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
says um each facility paid for in
 
03:55:11.429 --> 03:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
whole or in part with general funds
 
03:55:15.349 --> 03:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire so if just because um
 
03:55:18.309 --> 03:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
you know maybe we have someone providing
 
03:55:18.319 --> 03:55:19.830 align:start position:0%
you know maybe we have someone providing
services

03:55:19.830 --> 03:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:55:22.229 --> 03:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
at a facility that's not a detention
 
03:55:24.950 --> 03:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
facility say if they get in trouble
 
03:55:27.830 --> 03:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
and they get moved to another facility
 
03:55:30.309 --> 03:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
that's a facility that we are not
 
03:55:31.670 --> 03:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
paying for
 
03:55:34.469 --> 03:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
with our general funds and so it would
 
03:55:38.070 --> 03:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
not be covered under this law if you get
 
03:55:39.750 --> 03:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
if you're in wisconsin and you're a kid
 
03:55:41.429 --> 03:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
and you get arrested that doesn't mean
 
03:55:43.510 --> 03:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire is paying
 
03:55:46.309 --> 03:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
out of general funds to give money to
 
03:55:48.229 --> 03:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
the jail that is
 
03:55:51.429 --> 03:55:51.439 align:start position:0%
housing that that kid so i don't under i
 
03:55:53.269 --> 03:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
think that there's
 
03:55:53.279 --> 03:55:54.710 align:start position:0%
think that there's
um

03:55:54.710 --> 03:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:57.590 --> 03:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
that the example that you gave is
 
03:55:57.600 --> 03:55:58.630 align:start position:0%
that the example that you gave is
not

03:55:58.630 --> 03:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:56:01.189 --> 03:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
um the example
 
03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh or
 
03:56:05.030 --> 03:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
i think it's a misunderstanding this
 
03:56:06.950 --> 03:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
first sentence that the the facility has
 
03:56:09.110 --> 03:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
to be paid for and whole or in part with
 
03:56:11.030 --> 03:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
general funds so i'm not sure that that
 
03:56:12.790 --> 03:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
case that you gave as an example would
 
03:56:15.750 --> 03:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
actually um
 
03:56:19.269 --> 03:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
be accurate under this bill thank you
 
03:56:21.830 --> 03:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative belanger
 
03:56:23.590 --> 03:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair for recognizing
 
03:56:25.110 --> 03:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
me so i want to talk about two things
 
03:56:26.389 --> 03:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
number one
 
03:56:29.590 --> 03:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about detention
 
03:56:31.030 --> 03:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
not a group home
 
03:56:33.110 --> 03:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
which are two completely different
 
03:56:33.120 --> 03:56:34.550 align:start position:0%
which are two completely different
entities

03:56:34.550 --> 03:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
entities
 
03:56:37.670 --> 03:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
and so insinuating that we have students
 
03:56:37.680 --> 03:56:39.030 align:start position:0%
and so insinuating that we have students
detained

03:56:39.030 --> 03:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
detained
 
03:56:41.349 --> 03:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
in juvenile detention centers
 
03:56:43.429 --> 03:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
is factually incorrect
 
03:56:44.870 --> 03:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
we do not
 
03:56:47.550 --> 03:56:47.560 align:start position:0%
out of state we do not
 
03:56:47.560 --> 03:56:49.269 align:start position:0%
out of state we do not
detain

03:56:49.269 --> 03:56:49.279 align:start position:0%
detain
 
03:56:51.030 --> 03:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
any new hampshire
 
03:56:53.349 --> 03:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
under age 18 residents
 
03:56:54.790 --> 03:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
03:56:57.189 --> 03:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
they might be at a group home again
 
03:56:58.950 --> 03:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
very different things so let's make sure
 
03:57:01.269 --> 03:57:01.279 align:start position:0%
that we're providing factual information
 
03:57:05.349 --> 03:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
detained is defined
 
03:57:06.950 --> 03:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
by before
 
03:57:06.960 --> 03:57:08.309 align:start position:0%
by before
trial

03:57:08.309 --> 03:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
trial
 
03:57:08.319 --> 03:57:09.510 align:start position:0%
trial
committed

03:57:09.510 --> 03:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
committed
 
03:57:12.070 --> 03:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
means that you have had a trial
 
03:57:14.630 --> 03:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
a judge agrees that you did something
 
03:57:17.910 --> 03:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
wrong and you are now committed to sysc
 
03:57:19.110 --> 03:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
for example
 
03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a detention center
 
03:57:24.070 --> 03:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
we're getting hung up on a word here
 
03:57:29.830 --> 03:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:32.469 --> 03:57:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:34.389 --> 03:57:34.399 align:start position:0%
representative ellis alicia
 
03:57:36.790 --> 03:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for
 
03:57:39.910 --> 03:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:57:42.469 --> 03:57:42.479 align:start position:0%
i'm not hung up on a word
 
03:57:45.110 --> 03:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
but i feel like i'm negative nancy
 
03:57:47.349 --> 03:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
so the people that
 
03:57:49.429 --> 03:57:49.439 align:start position:0%
representative also are i believe are
 
03:57:50.710 --> 03:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
speaking of
 
03:57:53.910 --> 03:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
that are out of state the children
 
03:57:57.269 --> 03:57:57.279 align:start position:0%
they're they're not um named as
 
03:57:59.110 --> 03:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
being detained it's generally for
 
03:58:01.510 --> 03:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
treatment they use a different word so
 
03:58:03.510 --> 03:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's the first thing so i know
 
03:58:06.630 --> 03:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
factually she's not telling a story
 
03:58:10.710 --> 03:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:10.720 --> 03:58:13.429 align:start position:0%
 
secondly

03:58:13.429 --> 03:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:16.229 --> 03:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
for me i really think it's a good idea
 
03:58:16.239 --> 03:58:19.429 align:start position:0%
for me i really think it's a good idea
however

03:58:19.429 --> 03:58:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:23.670 --> 03:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:26.469 --> 03:58:26.479 align:start position:0%
cameras can be everywhere but they can't
 
03:58:29.110 --> 03:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
go in the in the bathrooms with the with
 
03:58:30.550 --> 03:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
the children
 
03:58:32.870 --> 03:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
where do things happen
 
03:58:32.880 --> 03:58:33.990 align:start position:0%
where do things happen
that

03:58:33.990 --> 03:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:58:36.070 --> 03:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
there are no cameras
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
i mean it's like policemen wearing
 
03:58:40.469 --> 03:58:40.479 align:start position:0%
cameras and then all of a sudden you see
 
03:58:42.830 --> 03:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
blank oh wow what
 
03:58:45.269 --> 03:58:45.279 align:start position:0%
happened oh they didn't turn their
 
03:58:47.429 --> 03:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
camera on
 
03:58:51.429 --> 03:58:51.439 align:start position:0%
so i think it may help in a lot of ways
 
03:58:53.429 --> 03:58:53.439 align:start position:0%
because maybe
 
03:58:55.269 --> 03:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
someone who's abusing someone doesn't
 
03:58:58.550 --> 03:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
realize where all the cameras are but in
 
03:59:00.229 --> 03:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
other ways
 
03:59:03.030 --> 03:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
the persons that have taken the time
 
03:59:05.429 --> 03:59:05.439 align:start position:0%
to figure out where all the camera
 
03:59:07.269 --> 03:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
cameras are
 
03:59:09.990 --> 03:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
are going to go to a place
 
03:59:12.309 --> 03:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
where they're not going to be seen and
 
03:59:14.070 --> 03:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
they can't be filmed
 
03:59:17.429 --> 03:59:17.439 align:start position:0%
and that's really scary to me
 
03:59:18.870 --> 03:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
and it's just like in the school schools
 
03:59:20.469 --> 03:59:20.479 align:start position:0%
have cameras too but they don't have
 
03:59:22.469 --> 03:59:22.479 align:start position:0%
them in the bathroom but a lot goes on
 
03:59:24.309 --> 03:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
in the bathroom
 
03:59:27.189 --> 03:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
every else
 
03:59:30.150 --> 03:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
and if i may representative
 
03:59:32.550 --> 03:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
yokela why are you giggling are you
 
03:59:35.990 --> 03:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
giggling at something that i said
 
03:59:39.510 --> 03:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm wondering if your your um
 
03:59:39.520 --> 03:59:40.790 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm wondering if your your um
your

03:59:40.790 --> 03:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:59:42.790 --> 03:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
position is that you want cameras in the
 
03:59:42.800 --> 03:59:45.349 align:start position:0%
position is that you want cameras in the
bathroom

03:59:45.349 --> 03:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:46.630 --> 03:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
i did not
 
03:59:49.910 --> 03:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
it seemed like you were implying that
 
03:59:51.510 --> 03:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
that it was a problem that we weren't
 
03:59:52.550 --> 03:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
going to be able to record in the
 
03:59:59.750 --> 03:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:01.349 --> 04:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
04:00:01.359 --> 04:00:02.550 align:start position:0%
representative long
so

04:00:02.550 --> 04:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:00:05.429 --> 04:00:05.439 align:start position:0%
with respect to um detention and
 
04:00:05.439 --> 04:00:06.630 align:start position:0%
with respect to um detention and
commitment

04:00:06.630 --> 04:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
04:00:09.750 --> 04:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
so we do have children
 
04:00:11.910 --> 04:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
detained out of state
 
04:00:13.590 --> 04:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
when they get arrested out of state
 
04:00:15.429 --> 04:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
they're detained if they get arrested in
 
04:00:17.189 --> 04:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
massachusetts they're detained in
 
04:00:17.199 --> 04:00:18.710 align:start position:0%
massachusetts they're detained in
massachusetts

04:00:18.710 --> 04:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
04:00:21.110 --> 04:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay now wait a minute let me finish
 
04:00:24.309 --> 04:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
i sat here and listened to all of you
 
04:00:29.030 --> 04:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:32.309 --> 04:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
in out-of-state facilities
 
04:00:35.269 --> 04:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
in a secure out-of-state facility
 
04:00:39.110 --> 04:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
so you know so so that's that's
 
04:00:41.590 --> 04:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'm you know i'm not seeing in this uh
 
04:00:44.790 --> 04:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
and i just today brought it to my mind
 
04:00:47.030 --> 04:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh having that discussion
 
04:00:47.040 --> 04:00:48.870 align:start position:0%
uh having that discussion
um

04:00:48.870 --> 04:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:52.710 --> 04:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
these are just detained miners
 
04:00:56.229 --> 04:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
securely detained not committed miners
 
04:01:00.070 --> 04:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
you're not confusing that representative
 
04:01:06.389 --> 04:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
what this bill is saying is
 
04:01:10.630 --> 04:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
if a miner is detained in the state of
 
04:01:21.269 --> 04:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:25.349 --> 04:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:27.670 --> 04:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
we cannot control
 
04:01:30.950 --> 04:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
what massachusetts laws are we cannot
 
04:01:34.950 --> 04:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
control what any other state
 
04:01:38.070 --> 04:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
is doing we can only control what we pay
 
04:01:38.080 --> 04:01:39.030 align:start position:0%
is doing we can only control what we pay
for

04:01:39.030 --> 04:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:01:42.150 --> 04:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
and what happens in our state so i think
 
04:01:46.469 --> 04:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
that's where the confusion may be
 
04:01:49.269 --> 04:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
04:01:52.309 --> 04:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
kids that are in facilities
 
04:01:54.950 --> 04:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
out of state but they are not being
 
04:01:54.960 --> 04:01:57.189 align:start position:0%
out of state but they are not being
detained

04:01:57.189 --> 04:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
detained
 
04:01:59.429 --> 04:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
in facilities
 
04:02:02.469 --> 04:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
that we pay for
 
04:02:04.790 --> 04:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
we're only talking about the kids that
 
04:02:06.469 --> 04:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
are detained
 
04:02:06.479 --> 04:02:08.389 align:start position:0%
are detained
here

04:02:08.389 --> 04:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:02:10.309 --> 04:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
04:02:15.030 --> 04:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
and facilities that we pay for just does
 
04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:19.920 --> 04:02:25.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:02:25.110 --> 04:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:27.590 --> 04:02:27.600 align:start position:0%

you can't we can't detain
 
04:02:54.229 --> 04:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
kids out of state it's why they go to
 
04:02:54.239 --> 04:02:56.229 align:start position:0%
kids out of state it's why they go to
sysc

04:02:56.229 --> 04:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
sysc
 
04:02:58.469 --> 04:02:58.479 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for their hearing
 
04:03:01.189 --> 04:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
there are no detained residents out of
 
04:03:02.950 --> 04:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
state i just want to make that
 
04:03:06.950 --> 04:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:09.670 --> 04:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative keller
 
04:03:09.680 --> 04:03:10.710 align:start position:0%
thank you representative keller
so

04:03:10.710 --> 04:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:03:13.110 --> 04:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
i think i understand representative
 
04:03:17.910 --> 04:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
long's point in that if a person
 
04:03:21.349 --> 04:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
that is paid for at a community or like
 
04:03:25.429 --> 04:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
a group home out of state gets arrested
 
04:03:28.630 --> 04:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
and they're detained in that state
 
04:03:28.640 --> 04:03:30.070 align:start position:0%
and they're detained in that state
they

04:03:30.070 --> 04:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:03:31.670 --> 04:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's potential
 
04:03:31.680 --> 04:03:32.550 align:start position:0%
it's potential
that

04:03:32.550 --> 04:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:03:32.560 --> 04:03:33.349 align:start position:0%
that
they

04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:03:35.269 --> 04:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
they are not going to be detained at the
 
04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
group home that we pay for they're going
 
04:03:39.189 --> 04:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
to be detained at whatever facilities
 
04:03:42.070 --> 04:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
that they have and those facilities in
 
04:03:43.910 --> 04:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
massachusetts or wisconsin are not paid
 
04:03:44.950 --> 04:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
for by
 
04:03:46.389 --> 04:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
by new hampshire
 
04:03:48.309 --> 04:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
and so that would not fall under this
 
04:03:51.110 --> 04:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
law because the very first part of this
 
04:03:53.189 --> 04:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
law says each indiv
 
04:03:56.389 --> 04:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
facility paid for in whole or in part
 
04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
and so therefore
 
04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
just because they are detained
 
04:04:02.229 --> 04:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
does not mean that they are detained in
 
04:04:04.309 --> 04:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
a facility that we pay for if they sent
 
04:04:06.309 --> 04:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
it to us in new hampshire then it would
 
04:04:07.990 --> 04:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
be a facility that we pay for but we're
 
04:04:09.990 --> 04:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
not paying for the detention facilities
 
04:04:11.110 --> 04:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
in maine
 
04:04:13.030 --> 04:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
