00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
should get started here um I think we
 
00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 align:start position:0%
have two items of business ahead of us
 
00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 align:start position:0%
toight one is I'd like to get I receive
 
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
some testimony from Michael Nor from
 
00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
 
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
today and uh I'm hoping it's an
 
00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fill in a lot of the
 
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
questions that I have as far as uh
 
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 align:start position:0%
moving forward with a uh extended
 
00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility Bill the other
 
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
thing which I would I'm relishing
 
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
occurring here is a conversation about
 
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
where we would like to see this Bill end
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
up areas of legislation that we'd like
 
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
to maybe try to cover in this areas of
 
00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
legislation that would maybe recommend
 
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
for further study down the line and
 
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
areas we don't see as part of the scope
 
00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
of this uh legislation and if we could
 
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
get a sense of that before the uh and
 
00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 align:start position:0%
that's getting a sense of it would help
 
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
us moving forward over the next couple
 
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
of weeks I would hope so without any
 
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
further Ado may I call Michael York nor
 
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.830 align:start position:0%
further Ado may I call Michael York nor
I'm

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
sorry and just for the record the
 
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
name uh thanks representative partial
 
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
and uh honorable members of the
 
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
committee good morning uh for for the
 
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
record my name is Michael norc uh and I
 
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
am here to represent the solid waste
 
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
management Bureau at the Department of
 
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.150 align:start position:0%
management Bureau at the Department of
Environmental

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
Environmental
 
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
Services um so I just just wanted to
 
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
provide some general comments
 
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
um relative to Extended producer
 
00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility I want to preface
 
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
anything that I say by just noting that
 
00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
I am not by any means an expert on the
 
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 align:start position:0%
subject of extended producer
 
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility but I am probably the
 
00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 align:start position:0%
best suited person at the department to
 
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 align:start position:0%
provide some insight
 
00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 align:start position:0%
um one thing that I note is that uh
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
often these proposals you know policy
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
initiatives for epr
 
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 align:start position:0%
are uh directed at Dees to administer
 
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
and oversee uh and one thing that I just
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
want to say for the record is that we
 
00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 align:start position:0%
are uh always sensitive to these kinds
 
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
of policies in terms of how they might
 
00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
affect our current program structure and
 
00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.830 align:start position:0%
affect our current program structure and
resources

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
um you know it's obviously an important
 
00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
topic and something that a lot of other
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
states are looking at but I just want to
 
00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
note that Dees is not currently
 
00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
resourced to administer such a program
 
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
um so if if there were to
 
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 align:start position:0%
be uh some policy initiative to come out
 
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
of this committee uh I would just uh
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
advise that it might be helpful to the
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
department if that policy were to
 
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
Envision how the department would be
 
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
resourced what tools it would be given
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
to basically carry out and oversee that
 
00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
program I was encouraged by testimony
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
provided by uh Folks at the last
 
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
committee meeting where they did
 
00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:56.879 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that you know there needs to
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
be proper uh oversight and
 
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
administration by the by the state
 
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
government uh and that the government
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
does need to be uh you know given the
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
tools whether it's Staffing or uh other
 
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
funding mechanisms to basically oversee
 
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.749 align:start position:0%
funding mechanisms to basically oversee
that

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:10.759 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
program um you can stop me at any point
 
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
too if you have questions I don't really
 
00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
have a a set u you know list of talking
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
points or anything but the only other
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
thing that I wanted to mention was
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
um as far as I'm aware epr programs can
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
be structured in a number number of
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
different ways um some of the older epr
 
00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:36.919 align:start position:0%
programs would basically give state
 
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
government complete oversight of the
 
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
program uh I think a lot of newer epr
 
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
programs are kind of leaning more
 
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.510 align:start position:0%
programs are kind of leaning more
towards

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
towards
 
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
a middle ground where the industry has
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
some oversight and input into the
 
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
process and and the day-to-day
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
operations um using something like a
 
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility organization or
 
00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
a PR um so that organization is is
 
00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
basically uh the mechanism by which
 
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
industry can have
 
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
some oversight and input into the
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
process the pro usually would be the one
 
00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
kind of doing the day-to-day operations
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
of collection and management of whatever
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
the product is that's covered by the epr
 
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.230 align:start position:0%
the product is that's covered by the epr
program

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
um so uh an a clear example of that
 
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
would be like paint care which is
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
something that has been administered and
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
implemented in a number of other states
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast um you know it's a a
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
system whereby used architectural paintt
 
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
can be collected for recycling or other
 
00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
disposal proper disposal and management
 
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
um and the paint Care Organization is a
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
pro so it's basically funded by the
 
00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
industry and they administer the
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
oversight and implementation whereas
 
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
government still has a role in terms of
 
00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
you know enforcement and just general
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
setting guidelines and uh performance
 
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
objectives or those kind kinds of things
 
00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
maybe there's some Ru making that that
 
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be taken into account um but I
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
just I just note that because um if
 
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
government is to be expected to take on
 
00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:10.839 align:start position:0%
complete oversight of the program that's
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
obviously going to take more resources
 
00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:15.399 align:start position:0%
uh versus a pro model which is probably
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
be a little bit less for the the ongoing
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
implementation and oversight there's
 
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
obviously going to be some startup uh
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
you know you know the standing up the
 
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
program getting it off the ground Ru
 
00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:29.959 align:start position:0%
making there so there's going to be some
 
00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:33.399 align:start position:0%
initial uh impact to resources and and
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
Staffing at the department but on an
 
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis a PR model could
 
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
potentially provide uh you know a more
 
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
efficient model and I think from what I
 
00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:46.519 align:start position:0%
understand industry also tends to be
 
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
more in favor of a PR model because then
 
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
they have some input into the process um
 
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
so those are the only comments that I
 
00:09:55.069 --> 00:09:55.079 align:start position:0%
wanted to to make but if if the
 
00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:56.839 align:start position:0%
committee has any questions for me I'm
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
I would like to ask you to elaborate a
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
little more on
 
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.910 align:start position:0%
little more on
uh

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
PR's and
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh I guess my one of my questions you
 
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
much involvement could we expect from
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
IND I mean mean to my way of thinking
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know I mean again we're all
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
green at this
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
um new territory but I could see
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
initiative where you have a preo an
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
industry and the uh State all being all
 
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
having a seat at the table but would
 
00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
that make it unwieldy having that
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
many that much involvement by these
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
different concerned um
 
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
parties thanks for the question
 
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
representative I'm I'm actually I'm not
 
00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
really sure in terms of the there are
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
probably others that are more um
 
00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
familiar with the
 
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
the nitty greedy details of how these PR
 
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.350 align:start position:0%
the nitty greedy details of how these PR
operate

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
operate
 
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
um the best I can say is that from my
 
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
limited knowledge I believe a PR is
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
really responsible for like the the
 
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
day-to-day operations of the program
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
whereas state government in those models
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
where there's a pro and then state
 
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:23.560 align:start position:0%
government is um kind of providing
 
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
General oversight enforcement Authority
 
00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
if there are problems uh you know
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
setting targets or uh General guidelines
 
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:35.079 align:start position:0%
for performance like what are you know
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
if if if there's a goal or something to
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
collect x% or you know manage this
 
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
material in some way um the government
 
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
kind of sets those those overarching
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
goals uh and then the pro Works to meet
 
00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:53.959 align:start position:0%
those goals so I I don't know I don't
 
00:11:55.389 --> 00:11:55.399 align:start position:0%
know that I can offer a really
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
definitive answer on that but that's
 
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
kind of my limited understanding is that
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
they're kind of working in tandem um but
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
but in terms of the operations and
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
day-to-day aspects uh Pro is really the
 
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
one managing like the financial aspects
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
of it and you know PR are often funded
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
by industry like manufacturers or
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
producers will pay into the pr
 
00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
organization based on their market share
 
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
or based on I think you heard about Eco
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
modulated fees based on the
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
recyclability or or the difficulty in
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
management of the product that they
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
produce so they will pay a higher fee if
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's more difficult to manage versus
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
other companies that may produce
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
something that's a little bit easier to
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
recycle or manage so they'll pay a lower
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
fee if I could ask about um eom
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
modulation of the prices do you think it
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
may be a simpler uh feat to have the
 
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
state involved with those aspects of it
 
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
uh less subject to uh industry
 
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.310 align:start position:0%
uh less subject to uh industry
adjustment

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
adjustment
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
that's not really addressing the problem
 
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
I mean I can I can I mean there's
 
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
there's so many different areas there I
 
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
know we're moving in a green area and
 
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
we're doing a lot of speculation here um
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
but I think it's probably one of my
 
00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
chief concerns personally
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
is who is going to be the Watchdog on
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
all of this I I mean even the fees I
 
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
think that we can get around that we can
 
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
get around so many other aspects of this
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
um but but the Watchdog itself that's
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's I think it's I
 
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
think I speak for most of us and saying
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
that would probably be our chief concern
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
um and so let me go back again and ask
 
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
my you know my very IL defined
 
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.550 align:start position:0%
my you know my very IL defined
question

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
would State
 
00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
involvement in a
 
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
PR counterbalance
 
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.829 align:start position:0%
PR counterbalance
industry

00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:13:58.829 --> 00:13:58.839 align:start position:0%
um management of the pr in such a way so
 
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
that we do get Fair Echo modulation fees
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
like or is it you think that they do
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
they effectively run themselves I I
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
think I understand your
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
question again very limited knowledge on
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
how this works there's probably multiple
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
different ways to structure it um but I
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
believe in most cases the pro is
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
governed by rules that a agency a state
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
agency might set so the agency might
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
decide what fees
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
are going to be applied based on
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
material types or based on product types
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
or whatever so it's not like the pr is
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
always deciding for itself how to manage
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's more like the government
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
sets very basic uh guard rails
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
essentially um to guide the actions by
 
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
the pro I believe so I think that that
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
would be one way to get at kind of what
 
00:14:57.389 --> 00:14:57.399 align:start position:0%
your your issue is that's a that's
 
00:14:58.990 --> 00:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
really does address what I me asking
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
about yes um I don't want to uh hog the
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh questions here but I don't see any
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:12.470 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
um and that concerns we have paint we
 
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
have mercury we have uh spent
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
Electronics we have uh postc consumer
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
packaging a whole list of products that
 
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
are good candidates to uh incorporate
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
and into a extended producer
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility create the grave
 
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
legislation um if you had a PR for every
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
one of those uh areas does that make it
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
un again speculation because again we're
 
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
doing things that are maybe a little bit
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
on Cutting Edge does that make it um
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
more difficult for a state agency to
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
manage and would it be a simpler uh more
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
Draconian solution perhaps us to have
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
the state agency take on all of these
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
aspects rather than dealing with number
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
of individual um
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
PR and again I mean I know that we're
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
you know I don't expect it to a yes or
 
00:16:15.199 --> 00:16:16.189 align:start position:0%
you know I don't expect it to a yes or
no

00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
answer yeah I I guess there's like I
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
said before there's multiple ways to
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
approach it um I think
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
commonly epr has been targeted by
 
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
specific category or type of
 
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
product uh because then it's it's more
 
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
it's probably logistically easier to to
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
develop a program that's
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
targeted uh because if you're going to
 
00:16:43.309 --> 00:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
have industry paying for it you want to
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
Target the industry that is responsible
 
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh so having one pro that I guess if
 
00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
that's your question like one pro that
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
kind of oversees multiple different uh
 
00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
epr programs versus PR for each
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
individual I would think having PR for
 
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
each individual e epr program would
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
probably be more logistically feasible
 
00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:07.959 align:start position:0%
although it sounds like it might be you
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
know more Cooks in the kitchen so to
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
speak but I think it's be it's
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
just probably again I'm not I'm not an
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
expert on this but I think it's probably
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
more appropriate to have a pro that
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
is targeted to the industry that is
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for the given product that
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
the epr is covering I don't I know if
 
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
that answers your question but um it it
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
does to some degree and again I know
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
we're in an area that I mean I think
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
really I wasn't even think in terms of
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
PR but that's the state oh coming in and
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
mandating the entire process
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
um uh requiring information from
 
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.150 align:start position:0%
um uh requiring information from
manufacturers

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
but having the state actually run the
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
entire epr program right uh as opposed
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
to you know and again you would get rid
 
00:17:59.470 --> 00:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
of a lot of books in the kitchen that
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
way as we say I like that analogy um but
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day I I don't know if
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
it we really would be beneficial
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
to just try to apply one standard right
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
across the industry for the sake of
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
efficiency maybe we do need you know uh
 
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
individual watchdogs on these very
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
specific areas I really don't know um so
 
00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
yes you did answer the uh question I
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
think to the best of our ability to
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
understand this time um I did have one
 
00:18:33.799 --> 00:18:36.190 align:start position:0%
understand this time um I did have one
more

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
question go ahead now would Dees
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
presumably be the one uh to provide
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
these rules these guidelines to the
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
pr I believe so again it depends on what
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
legislation is actually produced and or
 
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
proposed um but I think commonly the
 
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
environmental agency in a given state
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
would be the one that is assigned kind
 
00:18:59.950 --> 00:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
of responsibility for for Ru making
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
Administration enforcement and general
 
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:07.669 align:start position:0%
Administration enforcement and general
General

00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
oversight and of course that does
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
require Staffing so anything we're
 
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
talking about with the uh I mean we
 
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier I I think that that's
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
an important aspect that you know if we
 
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
are charging fees from industry in order
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
to manage this program some of those
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
fees will by necessity need to go to
 
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:27.799 align:start position:0%
Staffing at the dees I would imagine I
 
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
believe that there are programs that are
 
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
set up that way or at least reimburse
 
00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:33.799 align:start position:0%
the the state um so that they have some
 
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
coverage for their
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
yes I guess this is a a separate uh
 
00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:47.799 align:start position:0%
topic but generally in the in the same
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
conversation of everything uh I know
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
Dees has uh new rules coming out
 
00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.590 align:start position:0%
Dees has uh new rules coming out
regarding

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
00:19:57.149 --> 00:19:57.159 align:start position:0%
landfills uh and we'll we'll touch on
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
those in the later days in the in the
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
environmental agriculture committee but
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
do any of those rule changes um apply to
 
00:20:08.669 --> 00:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
single use uh materials single use
 
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
packaging do you know of I am so I'm
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
just to preface my comment I'm I'm not
 
00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
directly involved with the ru making uh
 
00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
project for for uh landfills but I
 
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
believe that the rules that are being
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
considered are more pertain they pertain
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
more to the operation of a landfill
 
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.950 align:start position:0%
more to the operation of a landfill
citing

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
citing
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh design and operation of the of the
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
facility I don't believe that we already
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
currently have the authority
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
to make prohibitions on certain things
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
being disposed of in a landfill I think
 
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
the Authority for that would probably
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.669 --> 00:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
legislation I think this is my final
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.430 align:start position:0%
question for you
um

00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.230 align:start position:0%
um
would

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
you have an opinion on whether I mean we
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
have these specific areas that we are
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
targeting you know we could let's say
 
00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to do epr for paint only or
 
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
for electronics only or for uh packaging
 
00:21:18.669 --> 00:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
only um but if we
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
do look at any individual organization
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
to pay their Fairway does that mean that
 
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
we're letting a number of organizations
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
off the hooks that were so they can I
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
think I heard the term
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
freeload meaning that if we're going to
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
look at um single use plastic bottles
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
but we're not going to look at
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
recyclable paper or paper of any
 
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
nature that's sort
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
of administering the laws perhaps in a
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
way I if I'm sorry I don't want to
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
interrupt if you're still no no I I
 
00:21:59.710 --> 00:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm really saying is would
 
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
you see something like uh epr
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
legislation be more effective if for
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
comprehensive across the board or if we
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
initiated it one step at a time with
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
problem Industries that's really my
 
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
bottom line question okay um I think the
 
00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
root of your question is probably more
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
it pertains more to epr for packaging
 
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
because that's such
 
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
a it's such a broad umbrella topic
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
um epr traditionally has been targeted
 
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
to very specific categories or types of
 
00:22:36.669 --> 00:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
products like like you mentioned Mercury
 
00:22:38.269 --> 00:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
Mercury was actually one of the first
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
epr programs in New Hampshire um and New
 
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was a leader on that
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh there's since been other states that
 
00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
have implemented Mercury bands or
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
takeback programs for thermostats and
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
things like that electronics are another
 
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
common kind of contained self you
 
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
know uh just just just easier to
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
identify kind of product category when
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
you get into packaging then you get into
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
those questions of equity I believe uh
 
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
because there's so many different types
 
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
of packaging
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
so and I seem to recall there was some
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
testimony at the last committee meeting
 
00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:15.799 align:start position:0%
I don't recall if it was uh from the
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
American Beverage Association or whether
 
00:23:21.789 --> 00:23:21.799 align:start position:0%
it was from um just zero or both of them
 
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
uh but I believe that they advocated for
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be considering an epr
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
for packaging program to make sure that
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
it is all-encompassing so that you're
 
00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
not just
 
00:23:33.269 --> 00:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
targeting plastic
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
containers uh and then leaving out paper
 
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
because paper of the recycling stream
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
paper is probably roughly 50 maybe even
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
more maybe 60% of the total recycling
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
Stream So if the goal of the epr program
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
is to limit the cost burden for
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.149 --> 00:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the epr program only
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
covers a certain part of that stream so
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
to speak uh then you're kind of missing
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
the boat um you know especially if
 
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
you're leaving paper out so I think that
 
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
I believe that was a a comment that came
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
up in previous testimony that it's
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
important especially with packaging epr
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
to look at the entire uh kind of the the
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
whole pie of what is being
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
managed does that help with your
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
question it helps me a great deal thank
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
you so
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
much any further
 
00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank thank you for
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
showing up today and thank you hopefully
 
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
future I'm hoping that next we can
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
engage in a conversation about oh I I
 
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
I'll be I I'll be right up in front I'm
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
thinking that our main sticking point or
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
the main thing we we need to decide
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
to look to pursue extended producer
 
00:25:05.389 --> 00:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility in the area I
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
mean are we looking at packaging at this
 
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
point single use packaging is part of
 
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.630 align:start position:0%
point single use packaging is part of
our

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
EPA I know that there are many uh other
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
areas we could be looking at we noted
 
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
some today electronics and the like and
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
I do think that they would
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
be I'd call them the lwh hanging float
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
fruit the easy things to address and I
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
think they should be addressed but I
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
think that also we should be addressing
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
single use packaging as well and I just
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
want to get a sense of how other people
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
that so uh when it comes to
 
00:25:43.159 --> 00:25:45.190 align:start position:0%
that so uh when it comes to
epr

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
epr
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
um first off I think a lot of companies
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
are already making their
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
packaging uh more environmentally
 
00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
friendly friendly by using less material
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh lighter because that that's lowers
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
the cost right lowers the cost of
 
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
materials I use uh to make that
 
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
packaging uh companies who aren't doing
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
that well why aren't they doing that
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
well one they're doing it for possibly
 
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
durability uh durability when it comes
 
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
to uh handling when it comes to
 
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
transport uh when it comes to freshness
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
of the product when it comes to safety
 
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
to avoid any type of
 
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
contamination uh also for easy brand
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
recognition uh if companies are forced
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
to create a more environmentally uh
 
00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
friendly uh container or packaging that
 
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
cost will ultimately fall to the
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
consumer whether you uh whether we have
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
these PR or
 
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
not uh I think
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
also let's say let's say epr legislation
 
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
does come about right and the consumer
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
goes shopping will they realize the
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
tradeoff that's been made when they see
 
00:27:06.269 --> 00:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
an item that they used to buy it's more
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
of a a cost now and they say to
 
00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:10.039 align:start position:0%
themselves well why is this cost so so
 
00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
much higher well you know forget that
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go with the cheaper um um
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
cheaper product because it's it's it's
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
less and I I don't understand why this
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
product is so much more
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
now not to mention if if also if if
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
companies are forced to to again uh
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
Force into this
 
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
epr will that now create a burden a an
 
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
environmental impact uh as far as okay
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
what additional energy is needed what
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
additional resources are needed to
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
create this now environmental uh
 
00:27:47.279 --> 00:27:48.630 align:start position:0%
create this now environmental uh
friendly

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
friendly
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
packaging and just last but not least to
 
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:54.200 align:start position:0%
talk on this I know some states have
 
00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:56.919 align:start position:0%
have implemented uh epr right now and I
 
00:27:59.789 --> 00:27:59.799 align:start position:0%
don't think there is
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
enough um I I don't think enough time
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
has passed to get a good uh results to
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
get a sufficient amount of results to
 
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
justify uh epr
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
legislation that's all I have to say
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you oh very good comments thank
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
you I think I'll like to continue with
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
other people look to weigh in but I
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
would like to ask one
 
00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:26.149 align:start position:0%
would like to ask one
question

00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
I don't have an answer on this I think
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of information out there
 
00:28:36.669 --> 00:28:36.679 align:start position:0%
but I have read in some cases that epr
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
the cost of epr has not found its way to
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
the consumer in other places where it's
 
00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
been done um but I think that's an
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
important point and I don't want to sit
 
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
here and you know make
 
00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.190 align:start position:0%
here and you know make
that

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
a a point where that we're going to live
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
or die on unless we have the facts
 
00:28:58.509 --> 00:28:58.519 align:start position:0%
established would you be open open to
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
investigating that as a
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
possibility to investigating uh what in
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
particular whether or not epr does add
 
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
costs I I think um that would involve
 
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
reaching out to manufacturers that would
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
involve reaching out to these producers
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh in these states to to see if
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
um what what additional cost has been
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
made if if any uh uh the price price
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
increase on their products if any has
 
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
been made um so I mean I can certainly
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
look into that I think we should I think
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
we could all sure sure but I I also
 
00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:44.519 align:start position:0%
think that part of the charge of this
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
bill is reduce Municipal costs and that
 
00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:49.519 align:start position:0%
would probably also imply consumer cost
 
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
so I think that if we can't do this I I
 
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
would agree it would be nonstarter if
 
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
that were indeed the case uh let's hear
 
00:30:00.509 --> 00:30:00.519 align:start position:0%
from AR next and then thank
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
you I was uh I was reading of a study
 
00:30:06.029 --> 00:30:06.039 align:start position:0%
done in Ontario and they use the blue
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
box system and they figure they're
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
getting about a little over 29% of their
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
Plastics back by doing that MH at a cost
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
of a little over 99 million a year that
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
that's the cost to run this program now
 
00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:28.039 align:start position:0%
assuming every cost is constant if
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
if epr was was enforced through the
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
companies uh to get 100% recyclability
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
would raise that cost to about 471
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
million I I don't believe the consumers
 
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
would eat that cost I think it I mean
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
the producers I believe it would be
 
00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
passed on to the consumers and and my
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
fear is the the people that get affected
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
the most of the lowincome people uh by
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
increasing the cost of the product so
 
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:57.750 align:start position:0%
increasing the cost of the product so
that

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chair um so we're having
 
00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.669 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chair um so we're having
a

00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
philosophical discussion about who Bears
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
first of all what we should do and who
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
Bears the costs um but um right now the
 
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
reason we're having this discussion is
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
that everybody all manners of our
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
economy are bearing the costs so doing
 
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
nothing we are bearing the costs
 
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
figuring out what we can do um is the
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
charge of of this committee and it is
 
00:31:45.789 --> 00:31:45.799 align:start position:0%
actually the
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the manufacturers and
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
product um uh
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
Distributors to fold in
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
the environmental costs associated with
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
their product into the lifestyle of life
 
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
cycle of their product that's their
 
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility they have to figure it
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
out right now the cheapest way for them
 
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
to get their products to us is the way
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
we are getting it and it is costing us
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
it is costing all of us now in the
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
immediate point of purchase sale
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
a container of
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
um a container of milk and I'm thinking
 
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
of like the containers that have very
 
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
thick plastic and they have a very dark
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
coating to protect the milk inside and
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
the very heavy lid I'm not talking
 
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily about the very flimsy
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
crushable um half gallon containers
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different for instance
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm this is just an example lots of
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
different types of containers for milk
 
00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the pantheon of all of these
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
types of containers and you can buy milk
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
in um in boxes too and we used to buy
 
00:33:11.629 --> 00:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
milk only in glass and the reason we
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
don't buy milk only in glass is it's
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
more expensive for the producer to buy
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
milk only in to sell us milk only in
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
glass so is glass the most efficient way
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
to deliver a particular product is it
 
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
the most efficient thing to uh recycle
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
do we have the capacity to recycle
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
that putting that responsibility back
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
onto the
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
manufacturer is what we are trying to
 
00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:49.720 align:start position:0%
figure out and assuming that the
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturer will throw up their hands
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
and say oh we just can't do it and it's
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
going to cost you all particularly your
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
lowincome uh
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
consumers another
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
20% that is throwing a them problem back
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
on to us we already have the problem
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
we're looking for their help in fixing
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
the problem so I would I would just like
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
for us to take a more macro view of
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
where the responsibility lies and we
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
have um you know we have a series of
 
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
States Maine is already doing this
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
um so there's you know what we could
 
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
take their
 
00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
um their bill that was
 
00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:38.510 align:start position:0%
um their bill that was
uh

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
1541 which specifically shifts the
 
00:34:45.069 --> 00:34:45.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility and cost of manufacturing
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
of managing packaging waste from
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities and citizens to the
 
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
producers and it covers and right now
 
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
they're starting they're starting
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
they're not doing it you know know
 
00:34:59.950 --> 00:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
everything what they're starting with is
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
plastic containers cardboard boxes and
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
other non-recyclables so they are just
 
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
starting here so while we may not have a
 
00:35:14.589 --> 00:35:14.599 align:start position:0%
bread of of um history across the United
 
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
States to look at we do have some and so
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
um we were very I think was mentioned
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
very forth thinking and and proactive
 
00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:28.599 align:start position:0%
about addressing in our Mercury issues
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
and so we we could do that I mean our
 
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
charge is to look at what other states
 
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
are doing and then figure out what would
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
be best for us but I would not hesitate
 
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
at all at all um by
 
00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.750 align:start position:0%
at all at all um by
the

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
assumption that a cost shift is
 
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
inevitable um in fact it can be brought
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
into you know figuring out how a uh
 
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturer pays for it and how much
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
that they can pass on to the consumer um
 
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
we we have we can have those discussions
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
um I just I I don't want to get caught I
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
I think personally I don't want to get
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
caught up in like I don't certainly
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to tell parter and gamble
 
00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:17.319 align:start position:0%
that they you know have to do more about
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
their tide jugs and um all the pack all
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
the plastic that goes on every bar of
 
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
soap that they produce and the
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
clamshells that go on on to all of their
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
razors because it's just going to cost
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
more and razors are already $15 like
 
00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:35.079 align:start position:0%
nope there are other companies that
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
package those things in
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
in in uh cardboard they don't do the
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
clam shells that are impossible to get R
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
up and have to be uh recycled and not
 
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
taken at all of our recycling centers
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
like that's a Proctor and Gamble problem
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
they have created a problem from us for
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
us we need to bring it back to them and
 
00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
say okay what you're sending us is not
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
okay this is not working
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
out we need in New Hampshire you can't
 
00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
send us clam shells like that anymore we
 
00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
could do that like you we could actually
 
00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.750 align:start position:0%
could do that like you we could actually
do

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
that could I
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
also express my understanding of a EPA
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
bill it doesn't forbid them from sending
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
clam shells or plastic bottles to New
 
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but what it does do is that's
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
if you're going to package that way
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
you're going to be responsible for the
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
entire product cradle to grave and the
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
municipality will no longer have to pick
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
up on the price of disposing of these
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
items which should lower the taxes of
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
that municipality if they're not having
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
to have additional tipping fees in this
 
00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
area I think that was the original
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
purpose of my buil not really to Outlaw
 
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
these but just to give Financial
 
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
incentives that choose other paths
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
that's how I see this epr being more
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
effective exactly like this this is the
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
discussion should you know is
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
it this end is like telling a a a
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
producer that like we're not going to
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not going to Bear the
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility of recycling Plastics
 
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
that's that would be a wild thing to do
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
but that could be at this end of the
 
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
spectrum versus bring it all in here we
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
don't care we're just going to fill up
 
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
our landfills um so we need to find
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
somewhere kind of close to here where we
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
are encouraging through our um
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
legislative rules regulations statutes
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
to minimize the amount of this kind of
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
product that comes into the state and
 
00:38:40.829 --> 00:38:40.839 align:start position:0%
should you choose to continue to send
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
this kind of product it will it will
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
cost you a little bit more um
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
Oregon not afraid to do that they did a
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
massive massive overhaul on um their
 
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
plastic pollution um by charging higher
 
00:38:57.069 --> 00:38:57.079 align:start position:0%
product fees
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
um for non-recyclable products to bring
 
00:39:00.359 --> 00:39:01.910 align:start position:0%
um for non-recyclable products to bring
them

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
in so New Jersey has um a very very
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive law so there's we have
 
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
templates we can pick one picking Maine
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
or New Jersey very East Coast I mean the
 
00:39:16.829 --> 00:39:16.839 align:start position:0%
other ones that are very that are a
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
little more ahead of us um because
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
they've only because they've been doing
 
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
it a little longer is Washington Oregon
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
California and Colorado um so if we if
 
00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:28.839 align:start position:0%
we were looking for an East Coast
 
00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
sensibility we have two we could take
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
those mark them
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
up put a couple versions to the
 
00:39:37.599 --> 00:39:39.630 align:start position:0%
up put a couple versions to the
committee

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:39.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
and and send that off as a report I
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
don't know how you all feel about that
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
that that that would be the work of the
 
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
the larger committee to take a template
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
from us
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
and I I know that this is exact kind
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
dialogue I think we need right now and
 
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for engaging in it um I'm
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
going to go back to something I asked
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
earlier um if we had safeguards to
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
prevent these costs from going back to
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
Consumers and we could see what other
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
states have done to enact similar
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
safeguards would that relieve some of
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
our concern in this
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
area as far as you're
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
concerned so again I think I'm still a
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
kind of wait and see approach let enough
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
time go by in these states where they
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
have enacted it and I do agree that it's
 
00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good idea to reach out to
 
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
some of these maybe
 
00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturers my my old thing is that
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
there's no way that the producers are
 
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
just going to eat eat these costs out of
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
the kindness of their heart without
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
passing it on to the consumer and in a
 
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
time like this where we have high
 
00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
inflation cost living is harder it's
 
00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.349 align:start position:0%
inflation cost living is harder it's
it's

00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to put this burden on the
 
00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.390 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to put this burden on the
consumer

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
um especially for some of these mom and
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
pop type uh businesses
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
where they can't compete they're are
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
already struggling to compete with the
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
larger organizations and forcing this on
 
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
them is
 
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
um it just it's you can't you can't ask
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:34.839 align:start position:0%
no please please but again uh the big I
 
00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
think the big thing is uh you're right
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
we should be reaching out to some of
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
these manufacturers in in Oregon and
 
00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:48.190 align:start position:0%
these manufacturers in in Oregon and
Massachusetts

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
Maine yeah um thank you thank you Mr
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you I I I really do
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate um the spot in which you are
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
um highlighting the pain point of this
 
00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
entire production and
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
um I want
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
to also highlight that we are already
 
00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
paying those
 
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
costs we all are
 
00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
already paying for this so um and it is
 
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
and the insidiousness of it is that it
 
00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:26.559 align:start position:0%
is hidden in a way that it is spread
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
across everybody but those Mom and Pops
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
um as well as the larger manufacturers
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
um and the larger Distributors and our
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
small businesses are already paying the
 
00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
cost the mom and pops are paying more
 
00:42:47.549 --> 00:42:47.559 align:start position:0%
because they actually live here their
 
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
businesses are here they're paying the
 
00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.349 align:start position:0%
businesses are here they're paying the
property

00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
taxes here and they're paying the
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
Tipping fees here
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
unlike the Walmarts that are not a New
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire based organization so the Mom
 
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
and Pops have to pay more now so I feel
 
00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
like we're all we're the reason we're
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
even talking about this is because it's
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
costing us too much um and I I I want to
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're that we um have a
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
holistic view of like this is a this is
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
a problem that is expensive now so if we
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
don't do something now it's not going to
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
get any
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
cheaper it's just going to deflect who
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
it so so what you're saying is then by
 
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
enacting epr even though the
 
00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
costs uh will be passed on the consumer
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
you're saying our taxes will be lowered
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
as as a
 
00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:57.230 align:start position:0%
as as a
result

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
result
 
00:43:59.549 --> 00:43:59.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I am I did
 
00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:03.079 align:start position:0%
not put up a a rubric of where the cost
 
00:44:06.549 --> 00:44:06.559 align:start position:0%
shifting goes what I'm pointing out is
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
that there is a cost that we are bearing
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
right now there you there may be maybe a
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
direct line between a regulatory
 
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
fee um that addresses epr that may
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
result in a downshifting of that cost to
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
our local businesses and consumers but
 
00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
that is not a given that's not a
 
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
straight line um and that is not a
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
formula that is reflected in the
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
programs that exist right now so I don't
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
think we have an either or um but what
 
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
we do know is that the
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility for changing the
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
trajectory we're on on it has to come
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:45:04.109 --> 00:45:04.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturers so if we're going to have
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
um you
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
know we're going to have hundreds of
 
00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
thousands of bottles of Li of liquid
 
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
laundry detergent those bottles have to
 
00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
go somewhere and there's no incentive to
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
package them any differently because the
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
company that you know Unilever keeps
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
sending them in and we keep buying them
 
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
and it's not unilever's problem once it
 
00:45:35.549 --> 00:45:35.559 align:start position:0%
gets onto the store shelves once they've
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
brought it to a store like they're out
 
00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
but now New Hampshire is deluged with
 
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
unil Unilever bottles left right and
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
center and now we have to figure out
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
what to do with them and here we have
 
00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
some organizations that are like oh you
 
00:45:51.549 --> 00:45:51.559 align:start position:0%
know what we should do we should totally
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
burn all of them and make um a and do um
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
chemical recycling which we know
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
chemical recycling blows out an enormous
 
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of pollution into the
 
00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
environment because we already talked
 
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
about this last session in um s in the
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
energy committee and the Senate so that
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
chemical recycling is such a
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
new way of doing things um that you know
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
we should not be looking to invite more
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
pollution into the state by because
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
we're we're afraid to tell Proctor and
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
Gamble or Unilever that we would like
 
00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.510 align:start position:0%
Gamble or Unilever that we would like
less

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
plastic so we can cut down and have they
 
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
they need they are not incentivized to
 
00:46:47.069 --> 00:46:47.079 align:start position:0%
repackage anything right now because
 
00:46:48.549 --> 00:46:48.559 align:start position:0%
it's working for them they're making a
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
ton of money there's no incentives to do
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
anything different and yes you are
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct correction not going
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
to do it out of the goodness of their
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
hearts you know they're not going to
 
00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
greenwash this just for funsies so we're
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
going to have to come up with a okay
 
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
here's how we're going to do it in New
 
00:47:09.309 --> 00:47:09.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I see what you're doing in
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
Maine I see what's happening in Colorado
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to take this tact it's not
 
00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
an all or nothing it's a start so
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
um you know right now how much you know
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
we're paying
 
00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
millions in waste disposal Millions
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
that thank you yes I would like to just
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
suggest this is my suggestion only that
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
such things as advanced recycling is
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
part of the further end of what we need
 
00:47:45.549 --> 00:47:45.559 align:start position:0%
to address here and I'm my own personal
 
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
concern would be uh stopping the waste
 
00:47:51.549 --> 00:47:51.559 align:start position:0%
flow that's coming into the state rather
 
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
than talk about you know how where we're
 
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
going to put the next landfill or how
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to do with Advanced
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
recycling I think these are all
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
extremely valid
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
concerns but I'd like to try to limit
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
oursel to the concerns around uh
 
00:48:08.349 --> 00:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility to
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
lower the waste flow and again to go
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
back to what the bill says and a lower
 
00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
Municipal costs um but I do appreciate
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
your comments very
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
much but we get we got to hear from
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
Arnie too but go ahead no please please
 
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so um also want to just I want to
 
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
just put it out there so that it's um
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
it's on our discussion Horizon that um
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
businesses like Amazon and Unilever I'm
 
00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
sorry to be beating up on them
 
00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
specifically it just happens to come to
 
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
Ry right now Proctor and Gamble um they
 
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
already are in
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
compliance with um regulations that are
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
are far far more complicated and
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
restrictive in
 
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
Europe and everybody there seems to be
 
00:49:09.549 --> 00:49:09.559 align:start position:0%
able to access shaving razors and
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
batteries and paint and laundry
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
detergent and we are letting them run
 
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
rough shod because we're afraid that oh
 
00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:22.839 align:start position:0%
well our laundry detergent might but go
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
up by 50 Cents well it seems like in
 
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
Europe they're able to wash their
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
clothes and um and not be gouged for it
 
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
and this is you know I'm I'm
 
00:49:34.789 --> 00:49:34.799 align:start position:0%
not I'm not unafraid to say that I see a
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
pattern in American manufacturing and
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
charging Americans for products that go
 
00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
into other spaces of the world where
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
those other places in the world enjoy a
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
far lower cost than than we
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
do um and and we're the ones who have to
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
recycle all this stuff you know we have
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit more space than they do in
 
00:50:03.069 --> 00:50:03.079 align:start position:0%
Europe but they have they have already
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
jumped ahead they're way ahead of us in
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
putting restrictions on that
 
00:50:14.109 --> 00:50:14.119 align:start position:0%
um packaging before it even gets to
 
00:50:14.119 --> 00:50:15.109 align:start position:0%
um packaging before it even gets to
their

00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
consumers so it's not it's not that it's
 
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
not been done before it's just that it's
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'd like to see more about uh
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
how how it's working out in Maine in New
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
Jersey maybe Colorado I'd like to see
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
more data on that um as as far as
 
00:50:45.549 --> 00:50:45.559 align:start position:0%
packaging there are things I think that
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't uh affect the cost maybe
 
00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
like egg cartons instead of being in in
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
plastic com in cardboard you know if we
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
could mandate things like that I I uh I
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
I think I might be naive because where I
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
live in Coos County Recycling is a big
 
00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
deal up there and we the re I go buy the
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
recycling center on my way to work and I
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
go buy it on my way home and it's it's
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
very effective I I
 
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
uh at our last meeting I I talked to a
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
few people and
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
apparently in some parts of the state
 
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
it's not that big of a deal and they
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
just throw the recycling in with the
 
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
garbage and I
 
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
I was very naive to to that uh but
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
I I just hate to see the I think there's
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
things that can be improved but I don't
 
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:39.640 align:start position:0%
think it should be a total uh
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility of of the manufacturers I
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
I don't see how that's going to work
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.789 --> 00:51:54.799 align:start position:0%
up I'd like to this again I think I was
 
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
another one of those people that was
 
00:51:57.309 --> 00:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
very naive and it was an eye opening
 
00:51:58.750 --> 00:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
experience to hear about how much was
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
not being recycling in our more urban
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
settings my compost goes to a compost
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
pile doesn't everybody do that um but
 
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
when it comes to things like egg cartons
 
00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:12.799 align:start position:0%
we're not outlawing plastic egg cartons
 
00:52:14.109 --> 00:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
where they saying if you want to package
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
your eggs in that way I think an EPA law
 
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
effectively would I think this is the
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
gist of an ep the way I understand it
 
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
would be choose paper or plastic if you
 
00:52:29.309 --> 00:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
choose paper it will be a lower
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
um cost lower fee to you in order for us
 
00:52:36.789 --> 00:52:36.799 align:start position:0%
to have our transfer
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
stations uh dispose of that than if you
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
choose another item and I I know if
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
that's really true that those two
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
particular products I suspect it is but
 
00:52:48.589 --> 00:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
it's not mandating them to package in a
 
00:52:51.789 --> 00:52:51.799 align:start position:0%
certain way it's giving them incentives
 
00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:55.640 align:start position:0%
to choose whatever is uh best for them
 
00:52:58.990 --> 00:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
and I kind of think that's maybe key the
 
00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
other thing which I'm kind of feeling
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
about and this is why I'm concerned
 
00:53:05.069 --> 00:53:05.079 align:start position:0%
about a wait and see attitude is New
 
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is already getting a lot of
 
00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.270 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is already getting a lot of
our

00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
um waste flow right now from our
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
neighboring states and Maine has already
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
enacted EPA law
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
epr Vermont is in the process of it
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in the process of it New
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
York is well along and Canada our
 
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
neighbors to North also have
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
EP and I would hate to be the last
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
player in the game to do it when we know
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
that our current landfills are already
 
00:53:38.309 --> 00:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
bursting at the seams because of outof
 
00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
State transferring I know not all
 
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
landfills do it some are admirable for
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
not doing that but a lot of landfills do
 
00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how much more pork
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
State can take so I I'd rather be
 
00:53:49.559 --> 00:53:51.190 align:start position:0%
State can take so I I'd rather be
proactive

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
proactive
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
personally um so please go ahead uh
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm on the environment and
 
00:53:58.789 --> 00:53:58.799 align:start position:0%
agriculture committee and we heard a lot
 
00:54:02.349 --> 00:54:02.359 align:start position:0%
of testimony uh I think more proactive
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
things are like the composting bill that
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
was brought up um and and I really
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
respect the Senate's opinion I uh about
 
00:54:14.589 --> 00:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
uh burning trash to energy but like
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
wheelator that's old technology they
 
00:54:16.559 --> 00:54:17.430 align:start position:0%
wheelator that's old technology they
have

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:54:20.589 --> 00:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
plasma uh facilities that they're very
 
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
expensive but they're very clean I I I
 
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:25.480 align:start position:0%
don't know why we don't look more into
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
that there it's not like the old Wheel
 
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
librator Systems they have scrubbers
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
they have the the big problem there is
 
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
the expense of the facility but I think
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
once it's in place I think that uh
 
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
landfill permitting that's been a a big
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
issue for a long time
 
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
here you know maybe we need to look into
 
00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:52.270 align:start position:0%
here you know maybe we need to look into
other

00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
avenues yes and Wheeler is right now my
 
00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.109 align:start position:0%
avenues yes and Wheeler is right now my
district

00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:54:59.710 --> 00:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
um the charge of this committee though
 
00:55:01.789 --> 00:55:01.799 align:start position:0%
is to find out how
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
to what we do before it even has to go
 
00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
to a place like wheeler breider
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
like we are looking to be proactive so
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
that we are not cleaning up um you know
 
00:55:17.309 --> 00:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
if we had if you had a bunch of toddlers
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
running around your house with chocolate
 
00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.109 align:start position:0%
running around your house with chocolate
snack

00:55:20.109 --> 00:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
snack
 
00:55:23.789 --> 00:55:23.799 align:start position:0%
packs the easy way to solve that problem
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
isn't to buy more Lysol wipes to wipe
 
00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
down your house because the toddlers are
 
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
running around with chocolate snackpack
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
fingers you bring down you take the
 
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:36.200 align:start position:0%
snack packs away and figure out a way to
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
seit them at a table with napkins and
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
spoons to do it differently right so we
 
00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
want to prevent the mess before we spend
 
00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:49.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of money and time cleaning up the
 
00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
mess and one of the ways to prevent the
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
mess is to provide incentives for
 
00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers um
 
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
to put better product packaging into the
 
00:56:07.029 --> 00:56:07.039 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire it's not telling
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
them like if you want to package in clam
 
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
shells that's what you want to do that's
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
how you want to approach your business
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
go for it but clam shells are going to
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
cost you more to put into the state of
 
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire than an a recycling
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
biodegradable box because those exist in
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
the world and we buy products in them
 
00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
right now so it would be what we're
 
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
looking for is an incentive program a
 
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
way to
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
incentivize producers to put better
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
product packaging into the state of New
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if they refuse to then
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
they need to pay for that they need to
 
00:56:51.789 --> 00:56:51.799 align:start position:0%
either pay when it comes in or they need
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
to participate in paying to to get rid
 
00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
of it but what we're trying to do is
 
00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
incentivize better packaging and when
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
you do that
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
um you will we will we will get a better
 
00:57:09.549 --> 00:57:09.559 align:start position:0%
product line we will get more recyclable
 
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
things there are fewer and and this is
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
not just about personal um products you
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
know we're our a lot of the waste comes
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
from places that buy an enormous amount
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
of stuff like universities and Hospital
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
hospitals and schools um and our and our
 
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
businesses that are also bringing in a
 
00:57:33.549 --> 00:57:33.559 align:start position:0%
lot of products to serve their workers
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
um so they're generating a lot of waste
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
too it's not just me and you in our in
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
our little houses um and all of that got
 
00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:41.799 align:start position:0%
to go to a
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
municipal place to be disposed of and it
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
costs money for those businesses to get
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
rid of that trash
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
so it's the incentivizing to do
 
00:57:53.799 --> 00:57:59.230 align:start position:0%
so it's the incentivizing to do
better

00:57:59.230 --> 00:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:01.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chairman uh so when you
 
00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:02.990 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chairman uh so when you
say

00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
incentivize well could it be that the
 
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
business the businesses the companies
 
00:58:10.829 --> 00:58:10.839 align:start position:0%
who opt into this uh program could there
 
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.349 --> 00:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
incentives that may be something where
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
the business can say all
 
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
right based on these tax
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
incentives we could afford to make our
 
00:58:26.829 --> 00:58:26.839 align:start position:0%
containers more environmentally friendly
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
make it more eco-friendly without having
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
to uh tack on that additional uh price
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
consumer thank you thank you for the
 
00:58:41.359 --> 00:58:42.990 align:start position:0%
consumer thank you thank you for the
question

00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:58:45.309 --> 00:58:45.319 align:start position:0%
um we're not taxing them to bring
 
00:58:47.069 --> 00:58:47.079 align:start position:0%
products in the state to begin with
 
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
that's not we would have to create a tax
 
00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
structure for that and I'm not
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
advocating creating a tax structure um
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
what I what I
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
I should
 
00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
clarify um I think
 
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
that using a model like
 
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
Maine which would create a
 
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
sustainability fund so if you put better
 
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
products into main excellent um if you
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
insist on continuing to use the product
 
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
packaging that is problematic for us to
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
dis ose of then we may have to charge
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
you a fee because we've got to dispose
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
of that stuff that you are bringing into
 
00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
the state so your incentive is to design
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
better packaging which is not a
 
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:43.720 align:start position:0%
reinvention of the wheel because there
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
are different packaging available for
 
00:59:47.309 --> 00:59:47.319 align:start position:0%
most of these products in different
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
places around the world they are not
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
going to be throwing up their hands like
 
00:59:52.349 --> 00:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
oh my God what are we going to do we're
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
never going to be able to sell in New
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's that is absolutely not
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
true because it's happening in Maine
 
00:59:59.710 --> 00:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
it's happening in Canada it's happening
 
01:00:02.029 --> 01:00:02.039 align:start position:0%
in Europe there are different your
 
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
products show up in different forms same
 
01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
product comes in different packaging in
 
01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
different parts of the world um but if
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
there's an incentive to bring better
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
packaging that is better to easier to
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
get rid of doesn't take up all that
 
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
space if they choose not to that's a
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
business decision on them which no we
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
want to bring in all of our two gallon
 
01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
containers of laundry detergent with the
 
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
thick plastic that is you know takes a
 
01:00:36.029 --> 01:00:36.039 align:start position:0%
great deal of time to
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
recycle um great that's what you want to
 
01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
do we're going to need you to contribute
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
into the sustainability fund because it
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
costs us to get rid of that stuff so
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:57.109 align:start position:0%
 
at

01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question sure
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
forgive my ignorance in this matter but
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
how do how do we monitor what they're
 
01:01:07.029 --> 01:01:07.039 align:start position:0%
using for packaging and at what cost
 
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
does this come like like do we have to I
 
01:01:18.029 --> 01:01:18.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
works I just don't want to put you on
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
the spot repeatedly uh I but uh I that's
 
01:01:29.549 --> 01:01:29.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
what my naive self thought that well epr
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
it works in Europe it works in states
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
where we've enacted it um it's an
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
incentive for business it's not a tax
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
it's to reduce consumer costs to me it
 
01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
seems like you know I'll be frank you
 
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
know I I hear your concerns but I'm a
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
bit naive and I'm thinking that it seems
 
01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:53.559 align:start position:0%
like pretty obvious to me that this is a
 
01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
good thing to move forward forward with
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
I think we need to really address your
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
concerns fully and then if we can't come
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
to agreement then we should proceed with
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
a different report than what I was
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
hoping for however to get to your
 
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
question we know what they're sending
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
into our state uh we have records of
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
that and we could charge the Department
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services with
 
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
monitoring this or
 
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
a or a producer responsibility or
 
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
organization do I have that right a PR
 
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
yeah um a private one to take these
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
numbers and say okay this is what you're
 
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
sending in it contains this much uh
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
material that could be dealt with
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
differently this is good we're going to
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
prate the disposal you on these we're
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
going to charge you a fee in order to
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
dispose of these and that fee will be
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
returned down to the municipal level
 
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:55.240 align:start position:0%
after administrative costs are taken out
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
of it um it's basically goes back to
 
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
this going back to
 
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
saying we're giving you a choice on this
 
01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
but we know what they're bringing into
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
the state and we have organizations that
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
will track what they bring into the
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
state from there it's a simple matter of
 
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know pretty obvious guess is that it
 
01:03:18.029 --> 01:03:18.039 align:start position:0%
ends up in our landfill once it comes in
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
but I was not I I thought we'd actually
 
01:03:21.269 --> 01:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
have people out in the landfills
 
01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
originally counting bottles and so I
 
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
mean it that is a good question
 
01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
please so these administrative fees how
 
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
do how do we know they're not more
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
than uh than what we're paying right now
 
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
for the recycling and in the trash fees
 
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:43.720 align:start position:0%
well I would expect that if we are
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
legislating and saying on top of what
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
our uh Oran our agencies are paying then
 
01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
we would know if they are greater uh um
 
01:03:56.109 --> 01:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
I should also add I don't think this is
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
something that we're going to pass one
 
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
law and everything's going to be perfect
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
from here on out I think there's a
 
01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
number of steps in even doing what we
 
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
call Echo modulation finding out that
 
01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
sweet spot
 
01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
where um if you want to dispose of this
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
this is how much it really
 
01:04:20.349 --> 01:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
costs how can we provide in financial
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
incentive for to change and then
 
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
addressing a stewardship fee on those
 
01:04:29.069 --> 01:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
changes um it's it's it's a process
 
01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:31.640 align:start position:0%
which is why I also feel a certain
 
01:04:33.309 --> 01:04:33.319 align:start position:0%
urgency for moving forward with this
 
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
because it is not something that's going
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
to happen overnight it is a process I
 
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
did I yeah okay I hope I addressed maybe
 
01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:44.599 align:start position:0%
not to your satisfaction but at least
 
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
yeah uh thank you Mr chairman um and
 
01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
when you say epr Works in other states I
 
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
don't think we know if it works for all
 
01:04:59.230 --> 01:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
parties in other states it's prob it's
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
working right now the process is working
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
they they've implemented it but is it
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
working best for all parties again I
 
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
think that remains to be seen and I know
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be focused on
 
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
epr uh but to accomplish the goals for
 
01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
which we want to accomplish I think
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
there are other methods new
 
01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
technologies looking at different
 
01:05:21.789 --> 01:05:21.799 align:start position:0%
Avenues uh for which the waste comes
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
into the straight into the state in
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
order to say all right let's find a way
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
around the US Commerce Clause to say
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
okay well Mass this waste has this trash
 
01:05:34.029 --> 01:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
has to go to waste energy or you you're
 
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
not going to get a tariff uh on on any
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
waste you want to bring into the state
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
there are other ways around uh looking
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
at uh epr to accomplish these goals
 
01:05:47.039 --> 01:05:48.870 align:start position:0%
at uh epr to accomplish these goals
only

01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:50.589 align:start position:0%
only
is

01:05:50.589 --> 01:05:50.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if this is the best
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
to is that an I don't know or is this
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
mean you don't believe that it is I'm
 
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
asking frankly because I I have another
 
01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.269 align:start position:0%
asking frankly because I I have another
follow-up

01:06:10.269 --> 01:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
question I don't yet believe that it is
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
because we
 
01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
haven't we haven't let enough time
 
01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
elapse in these other states to fully
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
see the uh results
 
01:06:28.029 --> 01:06:28.039 align:start position:0%
and and to say okay it is working it is
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
sufficient it works best for all parties
 
01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
and again I think it's I think I'm still
 
01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
approach okay I
 
01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
would think that we like being first in
 
01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:46.029 align:start position:0%
would think that we like being first in
the

01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
nation um I think when we have a waste
 
01:06:49.079 --> 01:06:50.190 align:start position:0%
nation um I think when we have a waste
flow

01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
flow
 
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
that's in Far excess of what our
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
neighbors are facing I don't know if we
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
have the luxury of doing a wait and see
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
and let's figure out what other states
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
do I I I I would hate to be the last one
 
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
on board of this one personally now
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's my feeling and we're going to you
 
01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
know we can choose to this be on that
 
01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
but I guess my deeper question would be
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
um right now for the purpose of moving
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
forward I'm getting this sense that
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
we're tell tell me I'm wrong I mean
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
sense we're pretty much split on what
 
01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
we'd like to see happen
 
01:07:28.589 --> 01:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
but what I would like to ask is
 
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
there a couple of concerns that we can
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
look at that would
 
01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
alleviate our disposition towards moving
 
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
ahead what would the if I were ask you
 
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
what maybe your one or two or even three
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
chief concerns are in enacting EPA
 
01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
legislation maybe we could focus on them
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
and see if we can move past them I'm
 
01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.549 align:start position:0%
and see if we can move past them I'm
sorry

01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
oh did I say it
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
again I'm so
 
01:08:04.109 --> 01:08:04.119 align:start position:0%
sorry I am horrible with anagrams um
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
does that sound reasonable though moving
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
ahead that way try to find out what our
 
01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:10.839 align:start position:0%
stopping points are what are the areas
 
01:08:13.309 --> 01:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
we think may need further study before
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
we come with an answer please go
 
01:08:16.719 --> 01:08:18.510 align:start position:0%
we come with an answer please go
ahead

01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
so Epi our our end game is to keep
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
things out of the landfill is that I
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
mean that's lower the cost okay lower
 
01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
the cost for yeah
 
01:08:34.349 --> 01:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
um I I I do believe there there may be
 
01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
some some things that can be done but I
 
01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think
 
01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
that's I think there's other things that
 
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
are much more important uh that like the
 
01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
land the composting bill that would keep
 
01:08:50.189 --> 01:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
25% out of the landfills per year that's
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
huge I think that's a step in the right
 
01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
direction right uh
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
mandating uh recycling but maybe make
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
education about it more important or or
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
some way find you know if we could get
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
more people to
 
01:09:05.199 --> 01:09:09.349 align:start position:0%
more people to
recycle

01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't I I agree that wheelator is
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
old technology but there are ways uh
 
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
what I've been reading is is these
 
01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
plasma I'm not sure the the full name of
 
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
it the
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
plasma systems that that incinerate
 
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
trash into energy with very little um
 
01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
they have scrubbers they have all the
 
01:09:34.349 --> 01:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
it's the the downside there is it's
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
expensive but they claim that's cleaner
 
01:09:38.669 --> 01:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
than than our universities or our
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals but they what they're putting
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
out I I think that those are the types
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
of things we I mean this this seems like
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
a small part uh piece of the pie is uh
 
01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
the E epr to me is I I I think there's
 
01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
room for things that could be done like
 
01:09:58.830 --> 01:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
you said on a Case by casee
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
basis I I just think that's where we're
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
looking in the wrong place for what what
 
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
achieve Mr thank you Mr chair um thank
 
01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
you I think that you're right this is
 
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
multifaceted and we have um
 
01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities to look on that back end
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
of how our we how are we then further
 
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
recycling shipping out burying burning
 
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
whatever that is composting that is on
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
that end of the spectrum absolutely
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
needs some some more definitive
 
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
direction right yeah definitive
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
Direction um for the purposes of this
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
particular committee though we're very
 
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
limited in our scope um in fact we
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely like have to our statutory
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
obligation is to study extended producer
 
01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility as a mechanism for
 
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
meeting the waste reduction goals
 
01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
established in RSA 149 M and reduce the
 
01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
tax burden that Solid Waste Disposal
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
places on
 
01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities we are supposed to
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
examine existing e ER epr laws in other
 
01:11:23.709 --> 01:11:23.719 align:start position:0%
States territories and International jur
 
01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and establish priorities
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
for more in-depth study possible targets
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
for epr include packaging single-use
 
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
Plastics beverage containers electronic
 
01:11:38.629 --> 01:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
waste batteries automotive waste and
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste we are to assess how
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
those laws that exist in other places
 
01:11:49.149 --> 01:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
can be adapted to our existing Solid
 
01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
Waste Recovery
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and what support
 
01:11:57.550 --> 01:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.470 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
would

01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
require for us to implement those laws
 
01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
so there are three other things and we
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
have met the
 
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
obligations um by soliciting stakeholder
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
input the chair has solicited
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input to talk to us here um
 
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
on what their approaches are um we uh we
 
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
are to suggest possible legislation or
 
01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.910 align:start position:0%
are to suggest possible legislation or
rules

01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
based on what we have found in other
 
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
states countries municipalities for the
 
01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
purpose of reducing our Municipal tax
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
burdens that is all we are charged here
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
to do it is a big big big concept and
 
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
Industry to wrap your head around but it
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
is not our charge to eat the whole
 
01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
elephant we just have to eat a teeny
 
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
part of it and we have to tell people
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
how we did that that so um we have the
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
things that we have not done as of right
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
now is fully engage in what other states
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
there are six other states who have
 
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
definitive policy in statute there are
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
14 other states 11 I think um it's in
 
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
the low teen mid- teens who are doing
 
01:13:17.229 --> 01:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're doing figuring out
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
what they're going to do because they're
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
also buried in trash
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
so what we have to do is now look at
 
01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
what the EU is doing and the other
 
01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
states so we have another meeting I
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
don't think we have to do that right now
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to send out some of my
 
01:13:34.629 --> 01:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
research to the committee so everybody's
 
01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
on the same page if you would like to
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
read that um but our charge um line
 
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
14 of of this bill is to examine epr
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
laws in other States territories and
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
international jurisdictions and to
 
01:13:53.709 --> 01:13:53.719 align:start position:0%
establish priorities for more in depth
 
01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
study so by November we have to have
 
01:13:59.709 --> 01:13:59.719 align:start position:0%
done all of these things and Report out
 
01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
studied you know this state this state
 
01:14:06.189 --> 01:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
this state this country here's what
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
they're doing here's where we think New
 
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire might be able to jump in on
 
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
this new way of approaching municipal
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
waste so we have multiple conversations
 
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
going on across multiple committees
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
about what's happening with w
 
01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
after it's already here this this
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is supposed to be just
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
looking at what do we do before it even
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
gets here that's that's all we have to
 
01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
do but we all have some really great
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
ideas about taking legislation about the
 
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
other end further which is great but we
 
01:14:44.669 --> 01:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
we really do have a very narrow Lane
 
01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
that we have to stay in um so I would I
 
01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
would hope that we can maybe have a
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
draft report in the next committee so
 
01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
that we can sign
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
off if that's reasonable but we we
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
really really do have to stay in our
 
01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
lane cuz that's what we are statutorily
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
bound to
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
do thank you Mr
 
01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you Senator
 
01:15:13.149 --> 01:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
uh in in line with what the senator is
 
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
saying this is what we're supposed to
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
look at nothing else and then my
 
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
personal opinion is a much longer
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
studying time frame will be need to is
 
01:15:31.709 --> 01:15:31.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
done given the fact we only have until
 
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
November November 1st that that's not
 
01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
enough time I don't believe that's
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
enough time to say hey we've researched
 
01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
it and we we said yeah it's great it
 
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
should be it should be for New
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think at least a year in my
 
01:15:54.629 --> 01:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
opinion at least a year
 
01:15:57.790 --> 01:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
to uh talk with these manufacturers in
 
01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
in Maine Oregon elsewhere to see how
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
it's affected their
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
economies much more time is needed um
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.149 --> 01:16:19.159 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like
 
01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
to thank you for all your comments I
 
01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
think with
 
01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
help if we could we have a record of
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
them uh beauty of streaming is that we
 
01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
can all go back and watch and I plan on
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
taking a lot of wisdom away from this
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
meeting this morning at the same time it
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
would also help if there's anything that
 
01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
I would care to put in writing
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
um I am taking it on myself is chair to
 
01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
spearhead the drafting of a report
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't think anybody else is
 
01:16:58.590 --> 01:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
chopping in the bit to do that but if
 
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
you are please please let me
 
01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay okay well well but but but it would
 
01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
be a great assistance if you would if
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
you would rather than have your records
 
01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
taken offline if you wanted to submit
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
them in a written form you know perhaps
 
01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
you might want to put more succinctly
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying so please please
 
01:17:22.679 --> 01:17:26.430 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying so please please
write

01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
um Mr Sher if I may that's the nature of
 
01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.830 align:start position:0%
um Mr Sher if I may that's the nature of
these

01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:17:34.030 --> 01:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
um of these committees is that it is a
 
01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
short amount of time which is why
 
01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
they're so narrowly scoped um and why
 
01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
approaching it with with a very clear
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
expectation that we are looking at EV
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
every every study committee is tackling
 
01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:48.790 align:start position:0%
every every study committee is tackling
an

01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
enormous um issue and the way that we
 
01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
break break down these enormous issues
 
01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
is to put smaller pieces of them in the
 
01:17:59.470 --> 01:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
study committee so there are other study
 
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
committees doing other things and this
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
happens like year round year round year
 
01:18:05.629 --> 01:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
round we are not supposed to
 
01:18:09.149 --> 01:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
solve the issue but we are supposed to
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
as every study committee is um charged
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
with putting our our academic and best
 
01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
foot forward our research best foot
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
forward and our um
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility as legislators to follow
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
the statute and participate in bringing
 
01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
the state just that much further along
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
so it would be great to have a year but
 
01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
we don't we were given 45 days so we got
 
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
to do the best we can with 45 days
 
01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
following the structure of what we have
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
been given by the legislature um and you
 
01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
know it's not impossible it's just it
 
01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes it doesn't feel good to do all
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
of the things cuz we all like now that
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
you get your fingers in it you start to
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
understand the issues you want to do
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
more you want to go deeper but this is
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
this is the beginning for which we all
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
can jump off and do more because you've
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
got the background to bring more people
 
01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
in so it can be overwhelming to try to
 
01:19:12.189 --> 01:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
narrow it down um but it's not
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
impossible it's a very specific narrow
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
scope and you know a recommendation may
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
be to create a long
 
01:19:23.719 --> 01:19:26.070 align:start position:0%
be to create a long
longterm

01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
longterm
 
01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
um research study that is in
 
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
collaboration with Dees you know that
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation thank you yeah thank
 
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
you so this is the first study committee
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
I'm on so I I'm not exactly sure how
 
01:19:49.470 --> 01:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
this works one once
 
01:19:54.669 --> 01:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
we make a report for this then then what
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
happens well we make the report uh
 
01:20:01.629 --> 01:20:01.639 align:start position:0%
it's this is my second study committee
 
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
but perhaps you have other people in the
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
room who can speak otherwise uh this
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
committee the report will be on file for
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
those that care to see it we have the
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
option of presenting legislation based
 
01:20:18.189 --> 01:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
on this report as well um the OS will
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
draft legislation according to our
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
guidelines if we choose to do as much
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
um my read of the uh and of course you
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
were all there
 
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
too uh of of the um Ena committee when
 
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
this uh when this was study committee
 
01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.310 align:start position:0%
this uh when this was study committee
was

01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
established was that a small group of
 
01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
people would
 
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
be more quick in coming up with
 
01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
potential legislation with addressing it
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
than a large study commission that that
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
I originally proposed I I proposed a
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
study commission I don't if you recall
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
that or not that would have lasted well
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
over a year and looked at the problem
 
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
that way and I think the general feeling
 
01:21:06.430 --> 01:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
Comm of the ENA was they want to see
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
something more strategic and something
 
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
happening more
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
quickly hence my urgency along with my
 
01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
urgency knowing that if we could reduce
 
01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
waste 5% 2% it's a reduction in the
 
01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
goals were set 1995 that we have not
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
even come close to achieving every year
 
01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
it's ground anything we could do at this
 
01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
point and I think it's perhaps and com
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
upon every committee that's meeting to
 
01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:35.639 align:start position:0%
have progress in this area to do all
 
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
they can so I would strongly urge that
 
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
if we can come to consensus on some type
 
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
of legislation it would give us the
 
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
ability to get our hands dirty in the
 
01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
matter and to see what may or may not
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
work according to Future legislation so
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's my may I take that as the F my
 
01:21:56.189 --> 01:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
final word
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
and do we have can we bring this to a
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
yes
