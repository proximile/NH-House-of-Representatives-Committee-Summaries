us see our responsibili Statewide and uh
 
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
what I'm delighted to present and
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
introduce this morning is House Bill
 
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
1128 which in fact is a uh has Statewide
 
00:07:57.629 --> 00:07:57.639 align:start position:0%
um implications uh let me start off um
 
00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
with uh with what the intent to the bill
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
is so the intent is to improve the
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
clarity and relevance of financial
 
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
reporting from the nonprofit corporation
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
that administers the state's um
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
education tax credit um program and the
 
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
state's U uh education Freedom account
 
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.950 align:start position:0%
state's U uh education Freedom account
program

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
so the bill itself is
 
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
uh pretty
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
straightforward um it just makes one uh
 
00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:34.519 align:start position:0%
one small change uh to uh to the
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
definition of a scholarship organization
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
which is part of the education tax
 
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
credit um statute and um and it strikes
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
out um 1 two 3 four five words so that
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
the definition of the scholarship
 
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
organization would mean a charitable
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
organiz organization Incorporated in the
 
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
state not just incorporated or qualified
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
to do business in the state so it
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
strikes the or qualified to do business
 
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
part leaves all the rest of it intact
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't make any other changes to
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
either the the um tax credit um
 
00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
scholarship program or the education
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
Freedom account program um so um so let
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
me let me just sort of um lay the
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
groundwork uh very quickly the um the
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization the definition
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the scholarship at organization was
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
put into statute back when the education
 
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
tra tax credit program was uh was
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
enacted so so it's it's under uh statute
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
RSA 77 colon
 
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
G uh G1 which uh which specifically is
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
definitions and that's what you see here
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh in the bill the
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
um uh the organization that that that
 
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
organization the scholarship
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
organization administers both the tax
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
credit program and the um the education
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
Freedom account program
 
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
and uh in fact the uh the EFA program
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
statute which is
 
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
194f part one defines the administration
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
of the program as being the scholarship
 
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
organization that's defined in 77g so I
 
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
just wanted to sort of lay out that
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the same scholarship
 
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
organization that administers the tax
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
credit program and the education Freedom
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
account program um so um so why is that
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
important because that scholarship
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
organization is administering programs
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
in the state that so far have um have
 
00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
benefited through 45 million nearly $45
 
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
million in taxpayer uh funds that are
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
appropriated through the state budget
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
and have been appropriated to the
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization in the first
 
00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:53.639 align:start position:0%
three years of the um uh of the EFA
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
program the um that organization gets to
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
retain 10% of that appropriation so 10%
 
00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:05.079 align:start position:0%
of the $45 million so far and you know I
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
know it's been it's gone back and forth
 
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:11.240 align:start position:0%
in this Committee of whether or not EFA
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
dollars or voucher dollars are taxpayer
 
00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
money or scholarship organization money
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
or or parents money but it's really
 
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
clear that there's no doubt and there
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be any doubt in anybody's mind
 
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
that the uh that the 10% that gets Ain
 
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
for administration is in fact taxpayer
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
money and um it's being paid for by the
 
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
state to a contractor to administer the
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
program and that contract is is approved
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
by um by the governor and the executive
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
Council um so the contractor that uh
 
00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:51.079 align:start position:0%
that that um that the executive Council
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
has approved and issued the contract for
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
is called the uh the children's
 
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund and it's an
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
organization uh
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
that um that is based in New York that
 
00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
works with from what I can tell 22
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
partner organizations in 19 other states
 
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
um uh and um and you can you can see in
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
the uh in the Federal Form that the
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
um that the children's scholarship fund
 
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
again the New York firm files they list
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
off all the partnership organizations
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
and all the partnership organizations
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
are 501c 3s organized in um in each of
 
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
the states that they do business with so
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund of
 
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia children's scholarship fund
 
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
of Baltimore the Bison children
 
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund guess where that one
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
it's in Buffalo um Catholic partnership
 
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
schools and they're all 51 c3s they're
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
all listed out but the children's
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund in New Hampshire is is
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
conspicuously absent from this list
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
because uh there is really no children
 
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund of New Hampshire that's
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
incorporated as a New Hampshire f 501c3
 
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
as all of these um these others do so
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
that the um the the revenues that again
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
the State dollars that um that go to uh
 
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
to supporting the education Freedom
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
accounts go through the um go through
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
the the New York the national firm get
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
reported out on on the national firm's
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
990 form 990 which is any you know which
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
is what nonprofits report for their um
 
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
for uh for in for tax purposes and um
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
and 990s are public records so anybody
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
can can inspect any 990 from any
 
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
nonprofit uh in the country and when you
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
look at what the um what what the New
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
York firm has reported and you know it's
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
45 pages long so I haven't gone through
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
every line of it but just looking at the
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
big lines um government
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
grants I mean I would think that the
 
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
that the grant that's appropriated from
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
for yeah both well maybe not tax credits
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
but for sure the education Freedom
 
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
accounts would be listed but they're not
 
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
it shows government grant
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
zero um so you know maybe that's just a
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
um you know an accounting oversight on
 
00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
the part of um the New York firm um that
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that level of oversight with
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
other states because all the other
 
00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:32.839 align:start position:0%
states have their own nonprofits um
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
doing it so so I think what what what
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to to do here is is
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
U provide a lot more clarity in the in
 
00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:47.759 align:start position:0%
the reporting and the relevance of the
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh the data that gets reported uh out to
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
um uh on the federal 990 and honestly to
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh to the members of the public who may
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
be interested in in what going on um you
 
00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
know I'll sort of conclude just you know
 
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
painting the big the big scope here in
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there's about 10,000
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
nonprofits we got a lot of nonprofits in
 
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
the uh in the state of New Hampshire and
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
fewer than 100 so fewer than 1% have
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
revenues greater than $25 million a year
 
00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:22.759 align:start position:0%
so both with the education tax credit
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
program and the EFA program uh certainly
 
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
pushes the children's scholarship fund
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
as far as new Hampshire based revenues
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
over that uh that line so you know most
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
of the nonprofits that have revenues
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
more than 25 million dollars a year you
 
00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:39.759 align:start position:0%
think talking about hospitals colleges
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
things like that but um the New
 
00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um children scholarship um uh
 
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
fund is definitely you know in that
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
category of high Revenue nonprofits so
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
so you know to sort of wrap up I think
 
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
there's three reasons why why I'd like
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
this committee to consider this bill um
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
first of all that New Hampshire as it
 
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:04.090 align:start position:0%
stands now is an
 
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:05.829 align:start position:0%
stands now is an
[Music]

00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:08.759 align:start position:0%
outlier all the other
 
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
um all the other uh programs that are
 
00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:15.399 align:start position:0%
being administered by uh new Hamp by the
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund have their
 
00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:21.319 align:start position:0%
own State uh their own their own 501c3
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
cor nonprofit corporations Incorporated
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
in the states where they op where they
 
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
operate so New Hampshire is an Outlander
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
that's number one number two uh to make
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
sure that um that the 10% that the
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund gets to
 
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
retain as part of administration goes to
 
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
supporting New Hampshire programs not
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
programs of other states can't tell that
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
from the uh from the federal filing that
 
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh that the New York organization puts
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
out and then finally um I'd say is to
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're providing the um
 
00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:53.959 align:start position:0%
the depart New Hampshire Department of
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
Justice charitable trust division with
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
access to clear accounting and and um
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
and and how government funds are being
 
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
used uh and not com not funds that are
 
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
comingled or or incorrectly reported uh
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
comingled with um uh with other states
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know the children's scholarship
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
fund is one of the largest charities in
 
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I think it deserves to
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
have I think as a I think as members of
 
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
the public we deserve to have clear um
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
uh Federal rep reporting on on their
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
work thank you thank you very much are
 
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
there any questions for the represent
 
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.470 align:start position:0%
there any questions for the represent
representative

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:41.799 align:start position:0%
rep luno for presenting this um so my
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
take on this bill is that it would
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
effectively have the state of New
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Outlaw and out of state
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
Incorporated nonprofit from doing
 
00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:50.919 align:start position:0%
business with the state of New Hampshire
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
so my question is given the
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
Constitutional provisions on Full Faith
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
and Credit the requirement that states
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
respect the laws of other States as well
 
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
as businesses Incorporated lawfully
 
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
therein is this not unconstitutional on
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
its face and likely to set up lawsuits
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
against New Hampshire that will'll
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
lose um thank thank you very much for
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
the for the question no you know
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely not I mean there's there's
 
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
other stipulations that are um that are
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
in the current statute such such as the
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
um the scholarship organization has to
 
00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:24.919 align:start position:0%
be exempt from income tax uh pursuant to
 
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
501c3 of the Internal Revenue code so so
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
you know it's not just any Corporation
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
it has to be a nonprofit corporation and
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
not just any nonprofit corporation but a
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
nonprofit corporation that's established
 
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.149 align:start position:0%
nonprofit corporation that's established
under

00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
501c3 and all this does is require that
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
Corporation to be um uh to be
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
incorporated in the state of New
 
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um and that can certainly
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
be within our
 
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
statutes just one quick followup on that
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
because that that helps explain some of
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
some of what I just um some of what I
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
just asked but it brings up another
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
question which is if we're being so
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
Ultra specific in law about a nonprofit
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
that checks this box and does this and
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
does that that specific type of
 
00:19:12.149 --> 00:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
nonprofit is not allowed to do business
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
with the state of New Hampshire if
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
they're in corporate out state would
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
that not give the impression that this
 
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
is targeting a specific entity or
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
entities so I think that's uh I think
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um um you know
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
the the the other
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
nonprofits that do business uh with the
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to my
 
00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
understanding are incorporated as 501
 
00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
c3s in the state of New Hampshire so
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
we're thinking about um mostly hospitals
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
that receive um receive financial
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
support uh from the state uh uh it it's
 
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
um it's clear that uh that this
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
nonprofit is also receiving Financial
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
grants from the from the state they're
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
not being reported properly they were
 
00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
not being reported as government grants
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh so maybe that's something that wasn't
 
00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:05.799 align:start position:0%
that was just a a you know an accounting
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
error by the uh by the folks that are
 
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559 align:start position:0%
running the um the New York group but
 
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:13.799 align:start position:0%
but um you know i' I'd say that it's
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
it's certainly consistent with the with
 
00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:18.039 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit status of other nonprofits
 
00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
the state does business with thank you
 
00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.190 align:start position:0%
the state does business with thank you
representative

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
leus yes I'm wondering given that um
 
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
most school districts come in at 10% or
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
higher for their administrative costs
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
and the particular organization that is
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
currently running this has come in at
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
under that even though they're allowed
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
10% they're come they've come in under
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
that and are continuing to decrease do
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
you have an actual problem with the way
 
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
this particular organization runs the
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
program so thank you for the question I
 
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
I actually do think it's very wasteful
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
and um in last session had filed a bill
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
to have the department um of Ed New
 
00:21:03.149 --> 00:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
administer the program rather than a uh
 
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
rather than a a contractor uh uh to do
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
it and uh yeah I think it's very
 
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
inefficient and wasteful the way it's
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
being done right now because when you
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
take a look at the um at the the the
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
dispersements that go from the
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
contractor um most of it is going to or
 
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
a line share of it is going to um to
 
00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:27.799 align:start position:0%
private and parochial schools around the
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
state and those schools have
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
administrative costs too likely on the
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
order of 10 or 15% so the 10% on top of
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
this is really on top of other
 
00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:38.919 align:start position:0%
administrative costs that are being paid
 
00:21:42.029 --> 00:21:42.039 align:start position:0%
so so I think if if and when this
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
program undergoes a a um you know a
 
00:21:47.549 --> 00:21:47.559 align:start position:0%
forensic audit which I believe the um
 
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
the the legislative budget office
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
assistant is going to be conducting this
 
00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
spring that um that hopefully that will
 
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
be one of the things that they take a
 
00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
look at is the the inefficient genes
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
associated with paying paying two levels
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
of administrative oversight

School to the University of New
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and now I'm the executive
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
director of children's scholarship fund
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um if you're a
 
00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
low-income child and your child's being
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
bullied or assaulted or below grade
 
00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:03.559 align:start position:0%
level and needs more attention um this
 
00:23:05.549 --> 00:23:05.559 align:start position:0%
scholarship program may have been the
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
thing that saved them um we've been
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
operating the program since um
 
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
2013 um actually just to be clear I've
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
been operating the program since
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
2013 um 93% of the families um that
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
participate in this program indicate
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
that they've seen measurable academic
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
Improvement in their children and 95% of
 
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
the children that participate in the
 
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
program say they're more satisfied with
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
the school um that they're attending
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
with the scholarship than
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
before um we've grown by an average of
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
about 50% per year currently there's
 
00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:47.799 align:start position:0%
only one scholarship organization
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
approved to do this work in New
 
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um in general this tax credit
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
program is small it has a capacity of
 
00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
about 2400 kids Statewide we raise the
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
money every year and then give away all
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
the money all the reports are published
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
on the department of revenues website
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
you can go there and see our reports all
 
00:24:12.669 --> 00:24:12.679 align:start position:0%
the way back to the first year of
 
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
2013 we have to reapply annually to the
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue to be allowed to
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
do this work and we have to do it to the
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
letter of the law every time so the only
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
way that the Department of Revenue would
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
re-approve us to run this tax credit
 
00:24:30.909 --> 00:24:30.919 align:start position:0%
program is if we did it exactly correct
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
every time if we didn't do it exactly
 
00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:36.279 align:start position:0%
correct every time we wouldn't be
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
reapproved um children's scholarship
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
fund like representative luno told you
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
is a part of children's scholarship fund
 
00:24:44.389 --> 00:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
National and I don't know if you can
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
tell but I struggle with with this bill
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
so in general um I feel like this bill
 
00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
is a direct personal attack um this time
 
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
I I'm usually can be really happy in
 
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
here and and chat with you guys and and
 
00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
be collegial but in this particular case
 
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
um in
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
2015 after running this program for a
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
couple of years by myself um I asked
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund National to
 
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire and help me
 
00:25:17.389 --> 00:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
personally I asked them myself um I was
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise alone and I wanted to grow the
 
00:25:22.389 --> 00:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
program in a way that was extremely
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
efficient and so to the discussion
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
earlier discussing that the program is
 
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
run inefficiently is in fact exact the
 
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
opposite of fact the reason I asked
 
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund to come to
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and help me is so that it
 
00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:41.559 align:start position:0%
would be efficient and so that it would
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
run you know well and under the 10%
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
prior to that trying to create
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in New Hampshire with
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
unemployment at zero I knew wasn't going
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
to be affordable or effective for the
 
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
children and the families and the way
 
00:25:58.269 --> 00:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
these programs work
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
the more efficient that I can run the
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
program the more money I can give to
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
families and I think everyone on this
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
committee after working with me in here
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
for 11 years knows two things one I
 
00:26:12.909 --> 00:26:12.919 align:start position:0%
really care about kids and do this work
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
to help children that don't fit in the
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
box and two I really want to give them
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
as big of a grant or scholarship as I
 
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
can every time whether or not you agree
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
with the mechanisms that are in place in
 
00:26:28.269 --> 00:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
state law I know that all of you know
 
00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
that and so I'm really struggling with
 
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
this bill because I feel like it is a
 
00:26:35.789 --> 00:26:35.799 align:start position:0%
direct attack on me and children
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund I mean everyone here
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
knows I'm a New Hampshire person since
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
we've grown with the education Freedom
 
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
account we've added eight employees in
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so this affects not only
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
my job and eliminates my job it
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
eliminates eight people I brought Khloe
 
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
with me today one of my staff people
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
from new from children's scholarship
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
fund New Hampshire I know that Matt is
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
in the back so it also eliminates eight
 
00:26:59.789 --> 00:26:59.799 align:start position:0%
jobs in New Hampshire of New Hampshire
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
people who live here and work here and
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
yes children's scholarship fund National
 
00:27:06.029 --> 00:27:06.039 align:start position:0%
helps by processing some of the
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
applications but though that shared
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
services model is in the nonprofit space
 
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
considered best practices for efficiency
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
and so by telling me that I need to do a
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
whole ream of paperwork in New Hampshire
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
it is making the grants smaller for
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
families so I can't help but think that
 
00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
and representative Ludo isn't sitting
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
there but if he was I would ask him if
 
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:32.200 align:start position:0%
this was if he did this on purpose if
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
this is vindictive you know knowing I'm
 
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire person Mr chair I mean I
 
00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:40.519 align:start position:0%
am I am actually in the room right now
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
and for represent luno you are not on
 
00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
the committee right now actually claim
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
that this personal luno sit down
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
entir not personal I didn't even mention
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
M M Baker de's name so it is not
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
personal it is completely on the merits
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
go ahead rep uh M demirez yeah I mean
 
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
honestly the bill itself would eliminate
 
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
the only person in New Hampshire that is
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
that runs the tax credit program the
 
00:28:12.909 --> 00:28:12.919 align:start position:0%
only organization that runs the tax
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
credit program which
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
IS300 children's
 
00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:18.519 align:start position:0%
scholarships right because
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative luno is saying in this
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill that I couldn't run the tax credit
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
program that I've run for 11 years okay
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
because I do have shared services the
 
00:28:29.549 --> 00:28:29.559 align:start position:0%
sponsor the bill the sponsor says I
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
couldn't run the program because I asked
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
a national to come and help to be more
 
00:28:36.509 --> 00:28:36.519 align:start position:0%
efficient the sponsor did not say that
 
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's what the bill says right I mean
 
00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:42.519 align:start position:0%
the bill 1128 did not say right the bill
 
00:28:44.669 --> 00:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
1128 says
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
that I would not be able to run the
 
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
program in New Hampshire that I started
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
because children's scholarship funds
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
founding documents were filed in New
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
York in
 
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
1998 that would make it so that
 
00:28:59.470 --> 00:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
I couldn't run the program that I've
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
been started in 2012 right for people
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
that are low-income in New Hampshire so
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's 1300 kids that would then be
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
without their scholarships and to um the
 
00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:12.039 align:start position:0%
sponsor's point he said that you have to
 
00:29:14.029 --> 00:29:14.039 align:start position:0%
do this to do that again the legislature
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
was designing the education Freedom
 
00:29:17.549 --> 00:29:17.559 align:start position:0%
account to try to also capture
 
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
efficiencies so that families could have
 
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
more grants so then it would eliminate
 
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
that as well the education Freedom
 
00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:28.039 align:start position:0%
account program which had has you know
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
4,700 kids so you're talking about more
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
than 5,000 kids losing their stay away
 
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
from the because this is about the well
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
it really I understand where you're
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
going because they are tied togetherit
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
yeah they're tied together
 
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative lad so the important
 
00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:46.519 align:start position:0%
point I wanted to make to everyone is
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
they're tied together so if we were
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
ineligible to run the tax credit program
 
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
we would then be ineligible to run the
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program and so
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
both of those programs were shut down so
 
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
I can't help but think is this bill 1128
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
political right is this a
 
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
political way to eliminate the programs
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
I mean just put in a repeal bill then
 
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
right I understand that not everyone is
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
for these mechanisms they don't
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree that they should exist
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
but telling me personally specifically
 
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
that I shouldn't run a program that I've
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
been running since 2012 is this is not
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
the right way to do it this is a sneaky
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
way to do it representative lad thank
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
you do you want to take questions sure
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit upset today this is a
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
hard one for me and so if everyone will
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
just be gentle I would appreciate that
 
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
because it's very personal for me I mean
 
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:43.519 align:start position:0%
it's it's this is a hard one I
 
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
understand that this is a hard one for
 
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
me because I'm I'm happy you know
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
representative you know I'm happy to
 
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
argue about the policy all day I got
 
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
that so I'm asking policy efficiencies
 
00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
and running a program so that we have
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
efficiency you're authorized by Statute
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
to use up to 10% for administrative cost
 
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
yeah what are you doing if you're with
 
00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:08.039 align:start position:0%
the money if for example you're able to
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
manage and hopefully you are for a
 
00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:12.200 align:start position:0%
lesser administrative charge we got down
 
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
to yes we got down to seven we gave
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
bigger grants happen with the difference
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
we give it to the families
 
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
representative lad so as an example last
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
year we ran lower than 10 we gave
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
another $300,000 to families so thanks
 
00:31:27.789 --> 00:31:27.799 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
F further questions representative Pell
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:35.799 align:start position:0%
being here today can you
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
explain how the um children's tax credit
 
00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:41.559 align:start position:0%
was working before the children's
 
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund became involved sure so
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
the first year um we I use we all the
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
time in the first year it was me by
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
myself okay and I raised about $150,000
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
and gave it to kids in the second year I
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
raised about
 
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
$200,000 and gave it to kids in the
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
third year you'll remember we had that
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
battle and so we went all the way up
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
through the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
arguing the constitutionality of it and
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
that year I only raised about 50,000 and
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
so to the discussion about the
 
00:32:16.919 --> 00:32:18.430 align:start position:0%
so to the discussion about the
administrative

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
costs remember it's up to 10% and so the
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
year that we raised
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
$200,000 that's only $20,000 and so at
 
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
that point I was having to just raise
 
00:32:32.509 --> 00:32:32.519 align:start position:0%
money to be able to pay myself to do the
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
work because this is clearly a full-time
 
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
job doing the job but the administrative
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
fee in that period was only 20,000 and
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
so I had to find a way to create and
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
make the program sustainable and so
 
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
after we run in the Supreme Court that's
 
00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
when I went to New York to talk to
 
00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
Children's scholarship fund National
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
because the program wasn't the
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
administrative wasn't covering the cost
 
00:32:59.710 --> 00:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
and I was having to just raise more
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
money to pay for the administrative cost
 
00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
I didn't think that was sustainable or
 
00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
efficient and so I went to Children's
 
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund and talked to Darla the
 
00:33:09.629 --> 00:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
president and asked them to help me in
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and two representative
 
00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
lunos pointed his testimony it is an
 
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
unusual circumstance usually they offer
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
matching grants to States their
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
Partnerships are slightly different in
 
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they agreed to help me
 
00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:25.720 align:start position:0%
completely 100% and at that point I
 
00:33:27.629 --> 00:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
became an employee of children
 
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund and that's how I was
 
00:33:32.669 --> 00:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
able to keep the program going when at
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
the time it was Tiny and couldn't really
 
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
afford any employees and then from that
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
point all the money that I've raised in
 
00:33:41.549 --> 00:33:41.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire stays in New Hampshire for
 
00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire kids but children
 
00:33:44.669 --> 00:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund has in essence been
 
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
donating to New Hampshire to cover the
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
operating cost so that I could do the
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
work and so to me I see it as an
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
Incredible Gift that children's
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund agreed to help me here
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
I think they realiz ized how passionate
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
I was about helping kids in New
 
00:34:02.669 --> 00:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and thought okay we can we can
 
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
help you with that and so then for that
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
to be this discussion here again way too
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
personal to me to be able to kind of
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
hold it together so I'm having a little
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
trouble quickly we have five more
 
00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
cards so sorry thank you one more quick
 
00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
followup when you say
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
that you were administering the program
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
initially yeah who was your employ who
 
00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
might I mean I had another nonprofit yes
 
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
another 501c3 so the way this works and
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
and representative luno did explain it
 
00:34:38.829 --> 00:34:38.839 align:start position:0%
fairly well so your nonprofits the 501
 
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
c3s that's that's what a nonprofit is is
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
that IRS saying you can be a t you can
 
00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
accept tax deductible donations you also
 
00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
register in for the Department of
 
00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:52.839 align:start position:0%
Justice in New Hampshire and the
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State in New Hampshire and
 
00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
so that formation paper work is
 
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
basically that any 501c3 any charity can
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
operate in any state as long as they
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
register in the state they're operating
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
in okay so you just go to New Hampshire
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
to the Secretary of State and register
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
as a 501c3 operating in that state and
 
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice and so we've
 
00:35:17.069 --> 00:35:17.079 align:start position:0%
been registered like that the whole time
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
which is why the bill I think was
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
written the way it is the bill the way
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
it's written originally it makes sense
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
is normal right you wouldn't be like you
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
can't the Red Cross can't operate here
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
because they filed their founding
 
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
documents in some other state right you
 
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that doesn't really make sense
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
and so the Secretary of State and
 
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice have filings from
 
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
all the nonprofits that are operating in
 
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
the state regardless of where they filed
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
their founding documents right like if
 
00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:48.200 align:start position:0%
you file your founding documents in
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
Delaware or Cal it doesn't really that's
 
00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:53.079 align:start position:0%
not a thing that usually ever matters
 
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
and so as long as you file your annual
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
reports and all your
 
00:35:58.829 --> 00:35:58.839 align:start position:0%
stuff with the secretary of state and
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and that's again
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
something you redo every year and so
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
they have lists of nonprofits that are
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
in good standing and so we've always
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
been in good standing in New Hampshire I
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
mean it's you file the paperwork in
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
their office and then file your annual
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
reports in their office it's there's
 
00:36:16.829 --> 00:36:16.839 align:start position:0%
some fees involved in it but you know in
 
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
essence that's that's what the way it
 
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
works did I help you are there further
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
questions representa
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman good morning
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
how are you I'm fine morning again I gu
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
sorry in the car of course um a couple
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
questions I have two first why aren't
 
00:36:34.589 --> 00:36:34.599 align:start position:0%
you a 51 what what is precluding you
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
from becoming a 50163 in New Hampshire
 
00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
um it would be needless
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
paperwork because we're we're already
 
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
registered in New Hampshire if you
 
00:36:47.069 --> 00:36:47.079 align:start position:0%
registered okay yeah so it would it be
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
just paperwork that was extraneous
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
extraordinary I guess it's unnecessary
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
paperwork right yeah it's unnecessary
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
that whole that whole resolve would be
 
00:36:58.750 --> 00:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
answer second one well the problem to
 
00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
your question representative Woodcock is
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
so if this bill passed as an example
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
okay yes we can start another 501c3 but
 
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
the IRS takes months and months and
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
months to do those determinations so
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
again we'd be doing paperwork
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily and it could be you know
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
take years to get another thing set up
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
so you know thank okay got the second
 
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
question if I follow up when you said
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
you were making uh 10% of 200,000 so
 
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
20,000 basically trying to make a living
 
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
um and now you say you have eight staff
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
employees what's What's the total salary
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
of your eight staff employees say that
 
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
again what's the salary the cost of them
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
they cost about a million dollars all
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
the employees yeah yeah so you've gone
 
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
from a staffing of 20,000 to a mil year
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
sure yeah I mean it's much bigger yeah
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
the program thank you thank you Mr chair
 
00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
further questions represent Damon by
 
00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
my question I have two or one is a
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
clarification okay I believe you said
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
that there were 2400 children in the tax
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
credit program and then a bit later you
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
referenced I believe 1300 children's
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
scholarships can you clarify those two
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
numbers I'm when I said 2400 that's the
 
00:38:16.109 --> 00:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
maximum that could be in the program so
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
may I 2400 children are are or are not
 
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
being funded through 1300 children in
 
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
the program 2400 is the most that could
 
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
ever be in there oh and that is in the
 
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
tax creditation tax credit program not
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
the EFA yes with the existing caps that
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
exist on that program you could only
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
ever get to 2400 kids in the tax credit
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
and there's 1,300 now thank you yes
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
how how much are the scholarships what
 
00:38:46.589 --> 00:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
are those families receiving the
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
scholarship average about
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
$3,000 okay and may I have a second
 
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
question one more question thank you
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
very much you're welcome in the sponsor
 
00:38:59.790 --> 00:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
's introduction it was referenced on the
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
federal 990 that there is no uh amount
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
listed in the grants part um so where is
 
00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
it listed what's the story so the grants
 
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
are uh it's a pass through so what we
 
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
recognize is the program service Revenue
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
piece so that 7% that pays us to do the
 
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
work the grants are passed through to
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
the family so the family is holding the
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
Grant in the class Wallet account and so
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
asset no we we we need to try to get
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
that on the side we we have more cards
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
and we're already beyond our time Al do
 
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
want me to put you in touch with the CFO
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
to explain that one representative Damon
 
00:39:48.309 --> 00:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
sure because it's a liability he the
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
explanation not just me yeah it's a
 
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
liability it's not an asset so the
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
grants are given to the family so we owe
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
the money to the family and we owe the
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
money back to the state so those it's a
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
liability the families are not getting
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
the administrative money no that's what
 
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
we recognize as program service
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
recognize you're welcome are there are
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%

for being here would you uh concur that
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
the purpose of both the tax credit
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
program and the EFA is to assist those
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
families that are 350% of the poverty
 
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:35.800 align:start position:0%

morning members of the committee uh my
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
name is py Campbell uh I will disclose
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
that I'm a former House Education
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh sat where you were
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
sitting and um I really appreciate um
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
what you guys do and the sacrifice that
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
you make I come down here once or twice
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
or three times a year and I know what a
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
commitment it is for your time so
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of where you is on where you
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
are on this issue thank you for your
 
00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
efforts um I am concerned that my
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
criticism of this bill will be
 
00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
sharp uh I think sometimes you have
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
to um state that things are just
 
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
wrong um as you may know I started a
 
00:42:22.549 --> 00:42:22.559 align:start position:0%
school two years ago uh with my wife and
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
some other concerned members of my
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
community we formed a nonprofit 5013
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
seat in New Hampshire um we opened a
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
school we had 32 students our first year
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
we had 46 students our second year and
 
00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:38.839 align:start position:0%
if you do pass this bill it will close
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
our school we'll unemploy another 10
 
00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
people we'll send 46 kids back into a
 
00:42:47.309 --> 00:42:47.319 align:start position:0%
public education system that failed them
 
00:42:49.309 --> 00:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
and I would just please ask you not to
 
00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
do that this bill is sneaky it's
 
00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:57.640 align:start position:0%
underhanded it's inappropriate
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
I've never seen a representative stand
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
up in the middle of someone's testimony
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
and do what he did I mean to have the
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
sergeant of arms in this room right now
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate I don't know what else I
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
might say that would literally have a
 
00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:12.599 align:start position:0%
representative stand up and interrupt
 
00:43:12.599 --> 00:43:14.030 align:start position:0%
representative stand up and interrupt
someone's

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
someone's
 
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
testimony that representative owes a
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
house an apology owes his committee
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
apology and I would say to you that I
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
thought he owed us an apology for filing
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
this bill but it only speaks to how much
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
I think there's just
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
an ins
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
sinuous caring of government more than
 
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
kids of unions more than teachers and
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
students this is
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriate please what's your what's
 
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
your point speaking on the
 
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
Billa unions other government emplo now
 
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
let's stay to the bill please this this
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
bill puts those types of institution and
 
00:43:53.309 --> 00:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
higher priorities than the institution
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
of my Catholic school I think it
 
00:43:58.589 --> 00:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
represents a a a historic discrimination
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
against Catholics in the state of New
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is a fact it's a history
 
00:44:04.829 --> 00:44:04.839 align:start position:0%
that we have as a state that we've been
 
00:44:04.839 --> 00:44:05.870 align:start position:0%
that we have as a state that we've been
very

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
anti-catholic this bill is an
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
extenuation of that discrimination and
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
as the father of my children married for
 
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
27 years and a guy who struggles to live
 
00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
his faith I know I'm not perfect but
 
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
that's my culture and I would like to
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
see it continue and this program helps
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
that culture and that religion continue
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
d destroying this program is an affront
 
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
against my religious freedom that's my
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
point and I hope that you will will
 
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
weigh that I don't I don't I think this
 
00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:39.559 align:start position:0%
committee should itl this bill as soon
 
00:44:39.559 --> 00:44:40.430 align:start position:0%
committee should itl this bill as soon
as

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
possible and you know I can speak
 
00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
further to the bill the 10% or the 7% is
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
a bargain yes we have administrative
 
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
costs on top of that at our school but
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have this children's
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund and the and and the EFA
 
00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
program we would struggle my wife is a
 
00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
Treasurer she volunteered she does all
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
the bookkeeping she sent me down here
 
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
this morning in a snowstorm to say
 
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
please don't close our
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
school and if you want to file a bill
 
00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
that says let's repeal the whole thing
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
and let's close it do
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
that but don't attack such a
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
longstanding beneficial scholarship
 
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:18.760 align:start position:0%

00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
everywhere to demand uh Foundation of CH
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh founding children's scholarship fund
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire is to bury a
 
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
symphony beneath silence is to dim hopes
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
of our children before they have a
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
chance to shine it is to build walls
 
00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
around boundaries Cur of
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
curiosity within each CH with each child
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
and the Very ability to ask why or to
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
dare to even dream what
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
if children's scholarship fun is not
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
just about academics it is also about
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
nurturing the Curiosity in the future of
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
our children it is the artist who paints
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
the Hues of Hope on a canvas that our
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
children in our
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
community rely on it is about empowering
 
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
the ability that one will will one day
 
00:48:08.109 --> 00:48:08.119 align:start position:0%
orchestrate change the hands that will
 
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
sculpt the Kinder and brighter reality
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
so let's not talk about whether or not
 
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund should be
 
00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
founded in New Hampshire does that
 
00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
really matter instead let's talk about
 
00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
the filing of ignorance the price tag of
 
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
our future being dimmed let us remember
 
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
that the greatest return in investment
 
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
is not steel or
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
stocks but the unleashing of human
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
potential the the blossoming of the
 
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
generation equipped not to just survive
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
but to
 
00:48:40.349 --> 00:48:40.359 align:start position:0%

has opened doors for students to receive
 
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
support that others wise the students
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
would not have had children's
 
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund is not just a handout
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
as some may just simply suggest but the
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
right to choose the education that best
 
00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
fits our children not every employment
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
is the right for for everyone and we
 
00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.630 align:start position:0%
is the right for for everyone and we
know

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
that nor is the type of school right one
 
00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:41.799 align:start position:0%
type of school right for every
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
child I know everyone of you believe in
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
the unwavering belief in the
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
transformation of power of giving this
 
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
to our children to give them a chance to
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
soar and I just beg you not to give up
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
on that belief just to satisfy Pol
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
politics or in eliminating this that
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
would eliminate the success that
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund has had on
 
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire
 
00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
students it should be about the children
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
as they are our future beaming with
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
potential and ready to paint the world
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
with their unique
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
gifts if you pass house
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
bill um 1128 you will wash our
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
children's hopes dreams inabilities to a
 
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
place of unrec to a place of
 
00:50:35.549 --> 00:50:35.559 align:start position:0%
unrecognizable to their future I ask
 
00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:37.720 align:start position:0%
that you vote no on House Bill
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
1128 and to keep our children's um
 
00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
choice of freedom of school
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights to choose and the
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
freedom to learn in the way in which is
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
best for them thank and I thank you are

welcome good morning
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
everyone I am here to oppose the same
 
00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.069 align:start position:0%
everyone I am here to oppose the same
bill

00:51:23.069 --> 00:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
I want to just Begin by saying
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
that this organization the children's
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund has changed the
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
trajectory of my family's life period
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
they're accessible every time I need to
 
00:51:44.589 --> 00:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
speak to someone concerning questions
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
processing my orders through class
 
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
wallet or um about filling out paperwork
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
or even a reference of where I should
 
00:51:56.589 --> 00:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
bring my children
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
like where is a good tutoring center
 
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
someone is always available to speak to
 
00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.230 align:start position:0%
someone is always available to speak to
me

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
immediately that doesn't always happen
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
when things are turned over to the state
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
and other
 
00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
organizations so I want to start off by
 
00:52:14.789 --> 00:52:14.799 align:start position:0%
telling you I am a homeschool mom of
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
four children and all four of my
 
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
children have been through the public
 
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.150 align:start position:0%
children have been through the public
school

00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
system and in my experience with the
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
public school system
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
they were not thriving I have children
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
that are falling behind in the public
 
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
school system and I have children that
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
have excelled I have a college student
 
00:52:36.789 --> 00:52:36.799 align:start position:0%
right now on her last year who was
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
homeschooled since the seventh grade I
 
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
also have a child who is brilliant and
 
00:52:44.109 --> 00:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
has a mind of an
 
00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:46.799 align:start position:0%
engineer that the programs in New
 
00:52:50.829 --> 00:52:50.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do not cater to that
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
mind so I broke away from the public
 
00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
school system
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
and its bureaucracy to enjoy the freedom
 
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
of the freedom Education
 
00:53:04.349 --> 00:53:04.359 align:start position:0%
Act and this person I've also been a
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
part of this program since before the
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
freedom Education Act came into play so
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
that little
 
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
$1,300 that I would receive from my
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
children to be able to go to an online
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
public Academy which didn't work out but
 
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
that is also why it's good to have
 
00:53:28.589 --> 00:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
freedom of Education because that didn't
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
work out and I was able to try something
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
else that would work for my child but
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the system in the public
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
school had failed my family in and so
 
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
working with this establishment has put
 
00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:44.799 align:start position:0%
my children
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
first I'm not looking to go back into a
 
00:53:51.309 --> 00:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
system that I gladly left behind that
 
00:53:51.319 --> 00:53:53.270 align:start position:0%
system that I gladly left behind that
doesn't

00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
work for my children and for other
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
children because my children are not the
 
00:54:00.789 --> 00:54:00.799 align:start position:0%
only ones that are benefiting from this
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
program all of my children right now are
 
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
excelling in their own way even my
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
child's test scores I do a Stanford 10
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
every year that I submit for the freedom
 
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
education account and if you look at her
 
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
scores now that she's been homeschooled
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
and her scores when she was in public
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
school is black and white night and day
 
00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:27.640 align:start position:0%
she is is actually thriving and I can
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
get the support that I need from my
 
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
children so as I'm listening to all this
 
00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
political talk and and and back and
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
forth and disrespect I only heard one of
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
the two parties actually talk about
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
caring about the children one and that
 
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
was this organization so I'm here to
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
represent my family but I'm also here to
 
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
say that I am happy to be a part of the
 
00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund and any
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
changes made here
 
00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
today are in your hands and affect our
 
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
children who are excelling in this
 
00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:07.240 align:start position:0%
program so whatever needs to get tied up
 
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
and the Loose Ends or whatever you guys
 
00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
need to look up you know do that do that
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
before you bring it over here to a place
 
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
where there's a snowstorm and I brought
 
00:55:20.589 --> 00:55:20.599 align:start position:0%
my children so that they can see how
 
00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:23.240 align:start position:0%
there's a program that's helping them
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
and right now my children are not
 
00:55:27.069 --> 00:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
doing their work so that they can come
 
00:55:29.789 --> 00:55:29.799 align:start position:0%
and see how things really operate so
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
whatever choices you make here today
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
remember you're also setting an example
 
00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
for these children that are watching
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much any
 
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
Vi thank you very much for coming today
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you in the
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:00.309 align:start position:0%
 
Wilkey

00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning thank you Mr
 
00:56:03.309 --> 00:56:03.319 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee I'm
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
Mary Wilkey I'm a retired public school
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
teacher and um I'm here to support this
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
bill um I'm I'm confused by the thought
 
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
that this would be putting um the cff
 
00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
CSF New Hampshire program out of
 
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
business or putting the uh executive
 
00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
director of it out of the program my
 
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
understanding reading the bill is it
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
would be ask them to incorporate as a
 
00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Corporation and I've been
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
through that process with some
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
organizations and yeah some paperwork
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
and sometimes you have to wait a while
 
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
but it's not that hard and the benefit I
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
so I I'm sorry that anybody would think
 
00:56:45.029 --> 00:56:45.039 align:start position:0%
of this as a personal attack to me it
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
just looked like a straightforward
 
00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
request to have the program be more
 
00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:51.160 align:start position:0%
locally based and and the reason I think
 
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
that's important is as a citizen who's
 
00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
interested in this program and um you
 
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
know you look online at the CSF New
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire website and they say we are
 
00:57:04.829 --> 00:57:04.839 align:start position:0%
transparent about our financials and
 
00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
then you click on their financials and
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's the New York you know it's the New
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
York organization which the first time I
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
saw that came as a surprise I thought
 
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
this was a local organization and when
 
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
you look at the 990s of the New York um
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
based larger organization you can't
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
really see what's going on here in New
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire everything's you actually can
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
for the CSF program because they
 
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
segregate things out but they don't for
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
the uh tax credit scholarship program so
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
I gather that any donations coming from
 
00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:35.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire businesses to the tax
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
credit program are accounted for by all
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
of their in the bucket of all of their
 
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
donations that they get and they get
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
like $20 million worth of donations and
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
they're coming I'm sure from all over
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
the country uh not just New Hampshire
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
businesses um that are getting tax
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
credits it's just hard to see what are
 
00:57:56.109 --> 00:57:56.119 align:start position:0%
the revenues what are the uh expenses of
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
the local office because the local
 
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
office is part of this bigger
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
Corporation so from a matter of
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
transparency that's my why I think one
 
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
of the reasons I think this would be
 
00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
good you can if they had their own 990
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
you could see well how much do they pay
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
employees how much do they spend on
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
lobbying if anything I don't know the
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
big Corporation spend some but maybe
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
maybe the local office doesn't um
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
there's a number of things that we could
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
learn as taxpayers and people in the
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
public where interested about the
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
organization that we can't learn by
 
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:30.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the numbers that are
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
reporting a large National Organization
 
00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
with reach in 21 or 19 States um I also
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
think that if you had a local board of
 
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
directors who was only responsible for
 
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
this organization which again I assume
 
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
would be still the same people um
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones that have I
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
imagine would continue to get approved
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
um if you had a local board of directors
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
board of directors have some Financial
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
accountability uh they're they're
 
00:59:01.309 --> 00:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
supposed to be in they're legally
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
accountable for the lawful and efficient
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
administration of an organization now
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
the board of directors in New York I
 
00:59:11.789 --> 00:59:11.799 align:start position:0%
doubt they're that focused on our
 
00:59:14.109 --> 00:59:14.119 align:start position:0%
program we're just part of a bigger
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
operation if it was a local board they'd
 
00:59:18.349 --> 00:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
be much more focused and might catch
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
things that a larger group might not and
 
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
and finally I'd like to say I think with
 
00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
um just generally when you have public
 
00:59:28.829 --> 00:59:28.839 align:start position:0%
money and public donations you need to
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
have good guard rails and when I say
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
this I want to say right up front I
 
00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:35.559 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody is doing anything
 
00:59:39.069 --> 00:59:39.079 align:start position:0%
illegally or intentionally unlawful but
 
00:59:41.029 --> 00:59:41.039 align:start position:0%
you have to be a you have to have guard
 
00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
rails against that you don't know who's
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
going to be running the program in 10
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
years um also people make mistakes
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
whether they're operating even when they
 
00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
are totally operating in good faith
 
00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
which again I assume people are right
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
now uh but for instance I think a lot of
 
00:59:57.029 --> 00:59:57.039 align:start position:0%
people think that the tax credit
 
00:59:58.589 --> 00:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization is being
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
carefully looked at by the Department of
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration but I had an
 
01:00:04.589 --> 01:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
experience of several years ago I was
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
looking at their reports and then um I
 
01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
noticed that there seem to be two
 
01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
different ways you could calculate your
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
10% fee you could look at it as 10% of
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
the SC of the grants you of the
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
donations you get or you could look at
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
it as 10% of the scholarships you give
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
out and those numbers are a little bit
 
01:00:24.359 --> 01:00:25.470 align:start position:0%
out and those numbers are a little bit
different

01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
and it looked to me and I'm not an
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
accountant so somebody could correct me
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong but I looked it looked to
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
me like for the first several years of
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
the program they were taking 10% of the
 
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
amount uh coming
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
in and then all of a sudden they
 
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
switched and we were taking 10% of the
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
donations they were giving out and I
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
didn't know any of the people involved
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
and I just thought well I wonder if the
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
the the department of revenu
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
administration might have switched their
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the law I just thought
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
thought why did that change so I called
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
the and I asked I called the director's
 
01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
office I said I have a question about
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
the scholarship uh program is there
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
somebody I could talk to so they
 
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
connected me with somebody and I said I
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
have a question about the scholarship
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
program and he said oh we can't answer
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
that any questions I said why not he
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
said we don't even review their we don't
 
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
review their reports we just stamp them
 
01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
and file them and I said nobody looks at
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
him he said no well not unless there's a
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
random audit sometimes we do random
 
01:01:24.029 --> 01:01:24.039 align:start position:0%
audits but of of all the businesses that
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
they over
 
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
and he say it's very rare so not likely
 
01:01:29.069 --> 01:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
he said you could file a fraud report
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
and I said well I don't think there's
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
fraud going on I'm not going to file a
 
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
fraud report I just wondered I just
 
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to get an understanding of why
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
there was this discrepancy so I just
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
left it I didn't know what to do with
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
that information um most and the
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
discrepancies were minor I'm not there's
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
not wasn't a lot of money except in one
 
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
case it was really small amounts but it
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
was I think I looked further and I think
 
01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
the second way they interpreted the
 
01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.029 align:start position:0%
the second way they interpreted the
requirement

01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:55.039 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:01:56.589 --> 01:01:56.599 align:start position:0%
was correct that they should be taking
 
01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
10% of the scholarships they were giving
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's what the law actually says so it
 
01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:03.640 align:start position:0%
looks to me I don't know that maybe that
 
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
somebody in the organization must have
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
caught that they were doing it
 
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
incorrectly and and they corrected it so
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
good for them but what if they hadn't
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
caught it or what if they caught it and
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
decided well we've gotten away with it
 
01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
this far let's just keep going you know
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
it's just and one other discrepancy came
 
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
up one of one year they took quite a
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
large they took like they were supposed
 
01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
to I think get let me look up the amount
 
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:29.839 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to get um I think
 
01:02:29.839 --> 01:02:31.750 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to get um I think
sorry

01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
three they were supposed to take
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
something like 21,000 but they put took
 
01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
71,000 something like that it's in that
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
ballpark this was the giving Ando
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
Alliance or uh yeah and um that was 2018
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
19 and then I just happened to stumble
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
on one time I went to print out the uh
 
01:02:54.029 --> 01:02:54.039 align:start position:0%
that year report and all of a sudden the
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
number instead of listing 71,000 as what
 
01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
they took in in fees it listed
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
26,000 and I went back and look cuz I
 
01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
printed out the report earlier in the
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
same report and the number had changed
 
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
in the you know over the course of the
 
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
year but there's no record on the on the
 
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
dr's website like that it had been
 
01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
amended or something and I noticed that
 
01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.039 align:start position:0%
the signature on both of these forms
 
01:03:22.829 --> 01:03:22.839 align:start position:0%
were the same date so they had been back
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
the second the amendment had been
 
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
backdated and the stamp that the uh Dr
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
put on it was backdated too so it was as
 
01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
as if the first report had never been
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
filed now again I assume somebody caught
 
01:03:35.549 --> 01:03:35.559 align:start position:0%
that there was an error because that
 
01:03:39.269 --> 01:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
71,000 was an error but um there's no
 
01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:41.799 align:start position:0%
record and and how do and I'm assuming
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
that when they caught that error they
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
gave back the money but how do you know
 
01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
somebody besides that organization needs
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
to be watching and the Dr apparently
 
01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:52.839 align:start position:0%
isn't and so I just feel that this
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
organization well any program not this
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
particular organization again I don't
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
mean to be implying anything about the
 
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
organization because I think everything
 
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
I see they're doing things honestly in
 
01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
good faith but make some errors sometime
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
as any human being does and somebody
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
else needs to be watching and I just
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
feel like this bill would add some
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
transparency and maybe some more local
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
oversight and um that's why I favor it
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli yes I'm just
 
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
curious about your last comment how
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
would uh this change that you're talking
 
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
about uh improve um the situations you
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
just described I uh based on the fact
 
01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
that they're just Incorporated locally
 
01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
well I'm wondering if there was a local
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
board that was requiring um more uh
 
01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
audits that were specifically on that
 
01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
program not audits of the whole $21
 
01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
million Corporation in New York maybe
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
they would have caught it sooner I don't
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
know um and then again um with well I
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
guess that's the only that particular
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
situation maybe that would be only one I
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
I brought that situation up to say that
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
you we have to have more oversight when
 
01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
if the or if the department that you
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
think is overseeing really isn't then
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
there has to be something and maybe
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
maybe more oversight should be added
 
01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
than by this bill but I do think if
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
there were a local board of directors
 
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
maybe that they possibly would have seen
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
it representative pel he had your hand
 
01:05:18.589 --> 01:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
up I think you had the same question is
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli for the
 
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:21.640 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner then
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
representative Bel thank you and thank
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I I kind of I
 
01:05:29.069 --> 01:05:29.079 align:start position:0%
had down here through the different uh
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
people that came and talked just about
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
the question that you asked in the
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
beginning or the statement you made that
 
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
you didn't see how that this was an
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
attack or that that it what what the
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
deal was was to remove the scholarship
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
organization it and I think uh the prime
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
sponsor said the intent was to improve
 
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
financial reporting um I also noted that
 
01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:54.710 align:start position:0%
financial reporting um I also noted that
uh

01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
the New York children's scholarship fund
 
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
has other places like Baltimore and
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia and they have their own
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
501c3 so what do you see
 
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
as why this is such a
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
um you know emotional thing that it's
 
01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
going to ruin the the children's
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund simply to have a
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
satellite organization in New Hampshire
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
that's that's registered here but still
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
would be like I think Red Cross was
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
brought up before you know we have a New
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Red Cross chapter but there's
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
a national Red Cross organization
 
01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:37.799 align:start position:0%
obviously International so do you do you
 
01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:40.039 align:start position:0%
see what the problem that that's that
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
was what my confusion was when I heard
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
the testimony because it seemed like
 
01:06:44.069 --> 01:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
some people thought this was going to
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
put the whole EFA program and ET and
 
01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
education tax credit scholarship program
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
out of business and I don't see how it
 
01:06:52.829 --> 01:06:52.839 align:start position:0%
would they could easily continue in
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
exactly the same way they are
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
and I assume that some leeway could be
 
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
given to allow them the time to get the
 
01:07:02.589 --> 01:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
certification from the IRS that they are
 
01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:05.799 align:start position:0%
now tax exempt so I don't see how it
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
would stop anything it seems like
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
everything can keep going there would
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
just be somewhat more transparency and
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
somewhat more
 
01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
accountability thank you represent
 
01:07:17.269 --> 01:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
for this test this morning um you
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this is primarily just a
 
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
matter of paperwork but that it might
 
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
take some time if we pass this bill this
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
bill would go into effect July 1st of
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
2024 about one month thereafter there
 
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
are, 1300 children in this state who
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
will be dependent on receiving outlays
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
from this organization in order to
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
continue the education they are
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
currently participating in if this is
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
going to take perhaps one to two years
 
01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:49.160 align:start position:0%
for this organization to organ
 
01:07:51.789 --> 01:07:51.799 align:start position:0%
reorganize here in New Hampshire what is
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
the expectation for these 1300 new New
 
01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children who will be without
 
01:07:59.470 --> 01:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
this funding come September of 24 is the
 
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
expectation that they're just going to
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
go to the local public school and have
 
01:08:04.109 --> 01:08:04.119 align:start position:0%
to leave their present schooling
 
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
situation um I wouldn't think that that
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing for kids I agree
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
with you on the implication of what
 
01:08:13.309 --> 01:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
you're asking um I would I would assume
 
01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
that there would be a way to uh amend
 
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
the statute I mean amend the bill to
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that there was an allowable
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
transition period I mean I don't know if
 
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
the representative the sponsor of the
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
bill would agree with that or not but in
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
my mind it seems like that's just a a
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
practical problem that could be
 
01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
addressed through amending the bill and
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
making it effective it or making it
 
01:08:34.829 --> 01:08:34.839 align:start position:0%
effective upon some length of time or
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
somehow addressing your issue um and
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
that it this bill doesn't have to spell
 
01:08:43.149 --> 01:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
the you know mean that all of a sudden
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
the whole program has to grind to a Hal
 
01:08:47.709 --> 01:08:47.719 align:start position:0%
it that doesn't seem to me what the
 
01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill is just for meeting
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
the language of it but that would be my
 
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
I going allow one more question seeing
 
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
the word running way late represent like
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
us you had your hand
 
01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.149 align:start position:0%
us you had your hand
up

01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
um given that this organization is
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
registered in New Hampshire while not
 
01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in New Hampshire and I
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm misunderstanding but it was
 
01:09:12.669 --> 01:09:12.679 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Dr Dr that you talk to
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering how much
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
oversight additional oversight there
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
will be if it's incorporated as opposed
 
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
to just registered in the state of New
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire given that it's our state
 
01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
who's not who's just filing and stamping
 
01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.349 align:start position:0%
who's not who's just filing and stamping
and

01:09:28.349 --> 01:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
filing well what what I'm thinking is
 
01:09:33.149 --> 01:09:33.159 align:start position:0%
that first of all if if they have if
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
they were reg if they were Incorporated
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire they would have their
 
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
own tax filings which would contain a
 
01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:41.960 align:start position:0%
lot more detail about their particular
 
01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
operation than you can see in the tax
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
filings of a larger organization that
 
01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
melds information from all around the
 
01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
country you see in the federal file in
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
the tax filing for the big one
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
organization you see oh you know
 
01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
something like $22 million in revenue
 
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
and $20 million in Grants given out well
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
you don't know what part of you can't
 
01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
tell from that what part is New
 
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's and then the other thing
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned before is if you're a
 
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
local if you're organized in New
 
01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire then you have a a board of
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
directors that's only looking at your
 
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
program and they have some fiscal
 
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility for your program and I
 
01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
would think that if your whole reason
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
for being was to operate these two New
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire programs and you're the board
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
you'll be much more aware of the ins and
 
01:10:33.149 --> 01:10:33.159 align:start position:0%
outs of those two programs than somebody
 
01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
in New York who's um overseeing programs
 
01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
Here There and Everywhere um
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
including the New Hampshire program
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
that's one small part of their big
 
01:10:43.709 --> 01:10:43.719 align:start position:0%
things I just think there'd be more
 
01:10:45.310 --> 01:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
attention paid
 
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
by the reason
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
501c3 have to have boards is because
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
they do provide some uh oversight and
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
some accountability
 
01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
and it would be closer oversight if it
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
was a a board only devoted to this
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
organization thank you thank you very
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
much with that I'm going to close this
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
hearing and we're going to move on to
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:25.149 --> 01:11:25.159 align:start position:0%
right well I said Technic advice we
 
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have any question so we'll take
 
01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
that and distribute it okay great and if
 
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
we have questions we'll be in contact
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
with you thank you very much I saw part
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.560 --> 01:12:00.990 align:start position:0%
 
leave

01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
welcome represent leus your bill is 1402
 
01:12:06.669 --> 01:12:06.679 align:start position:0%
establishing a procedure for a high
 
01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:09.080 align:start position:0%

01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
38
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
um my brain is still back in the last
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
the point of this bill is to allow
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
options for those kids who are
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
bright but have other things other than
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
sitting in school that they really want
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
to be focusing on for instance that
 
01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
gifted violin
 
01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.390 align:start position:0%
gifted violin
player

01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
player
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
who um wants to really devote her time
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
to the violin and has covered already
 
01:12:58.590 --> 01:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
understands and has learned all of the
 
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
things that are required of a high
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
school student if you'll
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
um she has to pass a test which would be
 
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
like the highet or the
 
01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
GED to not have to go to school and it's
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
not saying you must graduate you cannot
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
go attend school anymore it's saying you
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
are not required to be in school anymore
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
which means she could choose to take a
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
couple classes in the morning and devote
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
the rest of her time to her
 
01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
violin it also that person who has an
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an apprentiship as a
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
plumber that child may want to be able
 
01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
to do that but has to and
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
already is competent in the areas that
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
they would be in high school
 
01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
school but they have to be there
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
physically and can't be working on their
 
01:14:05.229 --> 01:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:08.189 --> 01:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship again if they wanted to
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
say show up in the morning and take the
 
01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
business class at their CTE Center they
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
could still do that but then they
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be required to be physically
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
present in the school building for the
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
rest of that day they could be working
 
01:14:24.629 --> 01:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
on their apprenticeship or the child
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure many of you know I
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
certainly knew when I was in high school
 
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
and as a high school teacher the child
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
who is bright learns quickly is bored
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
and really doesn't want to be indoors or
 
01:14:43.709 --> 01:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
sitting still the kind of person who's
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
going to be building houses or um doing
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
landscaping or that kind of thing where
 
01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
they're really into out out doors and
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
just to them it's torture to be in there
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
and so what happens with those kids they
 
01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
tend to cause trouble they act up
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
they're bored yeah they know this they
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to be here and they disrupt
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
the classes sometimes they don't even
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
graduate I know there were kids that I
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
went to high school with who were like
 
01:15:13.709 --> 01:15:13.719 align:start position:0%
that they were in the gifted program to
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
begin with but they just got bored they
 
01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
were in trouble all the time and some of
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
them didn't even graduate they just kept
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
their bodies in the school until the
 
01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
time when they could
 
01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
leave but they knew their material I
 
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
knew those kids they could have passed
 
01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
this test they could have gone out and
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
started their companies earlier a number
 
01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
of them eventually that's what they did
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
they started their own um mechanic shop
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
they started their
 
01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.910 align:start position:0%
they started their
own

01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
um landscaping business they went on to
 
01:15:50.669 --> 01:15:50.679 align:start position:0%
be very successful so why keep them in
 
01:15:50.679 --> 01:15:52.189 align:start position:0%
be very successful so why keep them in
the

01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
school when they can be following what
 
01:15:57.149 --> 01:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
they're good at and they've already
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
learned that's the point this is for
 
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
kids who've already learned what they
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
need to learn in high school some kids
 
01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
take 18 years to do that well 12
 
01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
years that doesn't take until they're 18
 
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't even take until they're 16 I
 
01:16:18.189 --> 01:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
know my daughter got her GED she kind of
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
dropped out so to speak at about 14 and
 
01:16:20.719 --> 01:16:21.510 align:start position:0%
dropped out so to speak at about 14 and
a

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:24.280 align:start position:0%
half um she was sick all the
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
time you know what she still got 98
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
percentile on her GED which compared her
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
with other kids who graduated at the
 
01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
same time she did from schools from
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
regular Public
 
01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
Schools clearly she didn't need to be
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
there all those years she went off and
 
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
did other things she helped run a
 
01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.030 align:start position:0%
did other things she helped run a
construction

01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
construction
 
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:49.400 align:start position:0%
company so that's what this is about my
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
Hope was that
 
01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.030 align:start position:0%
Hope was that
um

01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:57.870 --> 01:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
My Hope was that the Department of
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
Education would be able to make an
 
01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
arrangement with either the highet or
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
the GED to be able to use their tests
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
and to have them administer it I did
 
01:17:14.189 --> 01:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
notice looking at the financial aspect
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
um there were things there's an awful
 
01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
lot of things that they think that they
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
need and if I amend
 
01:17:30.669 --> 01:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
this to say instead of the location of
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education that was
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
just so they didn't have to take it at
 
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
their high school who might not be set
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
up for it that the site of the vendor of
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
the exam that would save that amount of
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
money a good bit of the money that's on
 
01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
the back of this but the other thing I
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
forgot to intend include was um who paid
 
01:17:55.149 --> 01:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
if they continue going to school part of
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
the time and that would be the same as
 
01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
homeschool kids it just needs to be a
 
01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
line written in here that says it's the
 
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
same as we do for homeschool kids there
 
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
is a RSA that covers that um and I think
 
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's it I'm open for oh thank you very
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
much uh are there any questions
 
01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
representative Hall thank you Mr chair I
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
question so I'm wondering where you feel
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
that CTE
 
01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
elos all that fits into that picture of
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
the student who's gifted well that was
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
why I said a child
 
01:18:35.709 --> 01:18:35.719 align:start position:0%
may want to take some courses still at
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
the CTE but not actually be at the
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
school for the whole day they may only
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
want need to take one or two classes at
 
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
the CTE maybe they want to take business
 
01:18:48.189 --> 01:18:48.199 align:start position:0%
or business and advertising and then be
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
done and go work on the other things
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
that they're interested in that they
 
01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do if they
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
physically had to be present in the
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
school thank you representative uh Mel
 
01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
beler and then representative
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
whitcock thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
you rep leus for bringing this um I
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
really like the underlying concept now
 
01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
that I've read it really thoroughly two
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
things that are potential small
 
01:19:14.110 --> 01:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
oversights jump out of me so I'm going
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
to show you what these are and ask you
 
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
if you would be amable to a possible
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
small amendment to this so the first um
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
is down here where it says uh
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
upon passage of the exam the student may
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
continue to attend school but they are
 
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
not required to immediately I see that
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
and I think well yes that makes sense
 
01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
however for purposes of discipline and
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
and normaly in the classroom we can't
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
very well have students being authorized
 
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
by the state to come and go as they
 
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
please so would would there be a
 
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
possibility for for a little change
 
01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
there just to designate that they are
 
01:19:49.629 --> 01:19:49.639 align:start position:0%
all all attendance and other policies
 
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
still apply to that student until they
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that would be the wording
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
but certainly I would be willing to look
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
at it so like if they enrolled for a
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
class they needed to attend that class
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
like other people in the class I think
 
01:20:08.910 --> 01:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
that would be about appropriate and the
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
other the other small thing I wanted to
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
look at was where it says
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
um if the student chooses they can take
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
this exam at the location so it's all
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
putting the choice of this on the
 
01:20:22.030 --> 01:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
student I I think it might be
 
01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate in this big decision to rope
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
the parents in to require parental
 
01:20:27.070 --> 01:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
approval do you think that's appropriate
 
01:20:30.189 --> 01:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
or or no I think that was in my original
 
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
write up and I didn't realize it wasn't
 
01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
in the actual bill okay perfect well I
 
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
think we can fix this and I'm quite I
 
01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
mean I already see things that I want to
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
amend so I'm very happy to have anybody
 
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
help me amend this represent
 
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you um Mr represent beler
 
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
on line 26 exactly what i' highlighted
 
01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
in yellow as well um so you're said
 
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
going address that I just moveed to my
 
01:20:58.990 --> 01:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
second part if I may um on line 27 uh
 
01:21:02.110 --> 01:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns I have is that so
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
this student would be offer a high
 
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
school diploma um and I I I have uh when
 
01:21:09.629 --> 01:21:09.639 align:start position:0%
you look at the uh line two and the
 
01:21:10.990 --> 01:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
requirements for receiving a high school
 
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
diploma uh has this meeting the high
 
01:21:16.149 --> 01:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
school graduation requirements but now
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
this person is taking a proficiency test
 
01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
in getting high school diploma which is
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
is in congruous with one and two with
 
01:21:24.189 --> 01:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
five and six they have the right to do
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
that they have the right to get a
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
certificate or GED whatever they get but
 
01:21:29.629 --> 01:21:29.639 align:start position:0%
to ask that they should have the right
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
to have a high school diploma from the
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
school that they didn't fulfill the High
 
01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
School requirements for they made they
 
01:21:36.669 --> 01:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
made this option I'm not suggesting that
 
01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
the the uh the availability or of the
 
01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
early release or the the the intent of
 
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to do um is wrong and
 
01:21:46.030 --> 01:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
that's why most schools have early
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
release programs for youngsters in the
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon that being said um I do
 
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
have um as a former high school
 
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
principal I do have concern that my high
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
school would be issuing a diploma for a
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
student who took an efficiency exam at
 
01:22:03.310 --> 01:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
thei yes that was why and I knew that
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
was that was one of the issues on
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
similar bills in the past and that was
 
01:22:09.629 --> 01:22:09.639 align:start position:0%
why I said either from the school
 
01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
district they've been attending or from
 
01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
the state so that if your school says we
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to issue this diploma fine
 
01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
the state does but the state has to say
 
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
this is a state diploma not from your
 
01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
school but from the state oh just thing
 
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
so if
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
I with line 27 as it is U representative
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
I I can't support that if if you allowed
 
01:22:37.149 --> 01:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
27 to be a state diploma deal we can do
 
01:22:39.189 --> 01:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
whatever they want probably like conern
 
01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
and not the High School record for but
 
01:22:43.229 --> 01:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
but what if the high school wanted to
 
01:22:45.229 --> 01:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
give them the diploma you're saying that
 
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
they can't that's why I said either or
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
no I'm saying that they've made the
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
requirements of the high school they get
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
a high school diploma this is they're
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
taking the exam excluding that thank you
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
I'm okay we'll have to talk because I
 
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
really am not sure since I
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
said A or B why you want to exclude a
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
since it's not mandatory it's only if
 
01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
the school wants to because if that
 
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
student did all of their work at the
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
school and got their competencies at the
 
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
school that school may decide that they
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
want to do that but I bring you back
 
01:23:23.709 --> 01:23:23.719 align:start position:0%
your line 27 at their request which is
 
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:29.639 align:start position:0%
not thank you further questions
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
represent tan I can fix I can change it
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
hi thanks for taking my question I like
 
01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
to follow up a little bit on what
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
representative Hall was kind of uh
 
01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
talking about and that is
 
01:23:45.149 --> 01:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
um in the present situation where where
 
01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
public education public charter schools
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
efas children's scholarship the whole
 
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
ball of works that's happening right now
 
01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:53.870 align:start position:0%
ball of works that's happening right now
elos

01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
elos
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
CTE um
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
homeschooling uh that violinist uh could
 
01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
certainly start at age two or three as a
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
homeschooler that was outstanding at
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
violin and be declared a homeschooler
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
and then go through and not be um
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
subject to compulsory uh sitting in into
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
a class compulsory attendance we had
 
01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
um student stents at karge a number of
 
01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
them that that would take um be at the
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
high school and then as an ELO they
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
actually uh competed at at ski school um
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
but was overseen by the high school um
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
so I don't understand why we need this I
 
01:24:44.910 --> 01:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
think that would be my first question
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
why it's needed because it seems like
 
01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
our system is so flexible right now that
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
a student that that wants to could um do
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
almost anything they wanted to uh and
 
01:24:59.950 --> 01:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
still get an education that would be
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
under the offices of the State education
 
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
department um it's the mandatory
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
attendance and if you're homeschooled
 
01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
there's a whole list of classes that
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to be taking as a
 
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
homeschooler and if you've already
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
succeeded at those um how do you stay a
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
homeschooler if you're not doing those
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
classes if you're just doing violin at
 
01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:27.229 align:start position:0%
classes if you're just doing violin at
that

01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
point I'm not sure that that's possible
 
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
reading The Homeschool rules and the
 
01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
things that have to be being taught but
 
01:25:38.669 --> 01:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
you may be right about that but the
 
01:25:41.629 --> 01:25:41.639 align:start position:0%
other part was that to the other piece
 
01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
of this is allowing them to totally opt
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
out get their graduation and potentially
 
01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
get a
 
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
job and may I have a followup Mr chair
 
01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
may I have a follow up on that um and
 
01:25:57.629 --> 01:25:57.639 align:start position:0%
that kind of brings out my second um
 
01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
problem with the bill and that is uh
 
01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
child labor um you know the the schools
 
01:26:07.229 --> 01:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
have a certain
 
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
um function in in providing uh working
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
permits for students and um or students
 
01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
children that are aged 16 um and this
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
would take them totally out of that
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
range so that uh they would they would
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
not be uh there would be no oversight on
 
01:26:31.229 --> 01:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
child labor at this at this point um
 
01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
this this does not do anything about
 
01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:37.400 align:start position:0%
child labor laws now there is a bill
 
01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:40.280 align:start position:0%
under labor that says if they are not
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
required to be in school during certain
 
01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
hours they can work during those hours
 
01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
as long as all the other child labor
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
laws are followed and that's going to be
 
01:26:54.109 --> 01:26:54.119 align:start position:0%
heard before Labor but um this doesn't
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
touch La child labor laws at all child
 
01:26:59.229 --> 01:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
labor laws would still have to follow
 
01:27:02.109 --> 01:27:02.119 align:start position:0%
whatever they whatever they
 
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
are but I know that in I know that kids
 
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
can start working at 15 and a
 
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
half and pot and some other jobs
 
01:27:15.390 --> 01:27:15.400 align:start position:0%
potentially earlier and I don't I mean
 
01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
if it's a how do you qualify an
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship thank you very much uh we
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
have four more cards here uh when we get
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
to further speakers I'm going to do what
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
we've done sometimes limits to three
 
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
minutes per person uh as time frame are
 
01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
there further questions of the
 
01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:36.149 align:start position:0%
there further questions of the
representative

01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:27:40.030 --> 01:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:27:43.709 --> 01:27:43.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question are you
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
aware of the role of the in the schools
 
01:27:51.629 --> 01:27:51.639 align:start position:0%
of using the uh sixth grade PSAT to
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
assess the
 
01:27:55.950 --> 01:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
competencies of children I know they
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
used it with my children when they
 
01:28:00.669 --> 01:28:00.679 align:start position:0%
simply got bored and they wanted to take
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
Advanced courses that then the schools
 
01:28:06.030 --> 01:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
didn't have and so they were able to go
 
01:28:09.709 --> 01:28:09.719 align:start position:0%
into the John's Hopkins Scholars Program
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
which allowed them to take college
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
courses that applied to their high
 
01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
school diploma getting back to my
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
colleague's question over here so that
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
they did graduate with a high school
 
01:28:23.709 --> 01:28:23.719 align:start position:0%
diploma but it included courses from
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
universities and colleges to fulfill
 
01:28:26.719 --> 01:28:27.669 align:start position:0%
universities and colleges to fulfill
those

01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
requirements I'm aware my um oldest went
 
01:28:32.669 --> 01:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
to college at
 
01:28:37.709 --> 01:28:37.719 align:start position:0%
16 on fully paid for and provided by the
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
state um I know kids can do those things
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
this was for the kids that didn't fit
 
01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:45.550 align:start position:0%
this was for the kids that didn't fit
into

01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
that you know they're not College Bound
 
01:28:51.629 --> 01:28:51.639 align:start position:0%
they're have other goals other things
 
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
that they want to do right but they
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
still might take courses at College
 
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
follow follow up question no this not a
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
debate Society yep okay further further
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very
 
01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
much and as I mentioned and we've done
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
it prior to this year as well we're
 
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
going to limit the next to three minute
 
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
piece and I'd like to uh recognize
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:30.669 align:start position:0%
 
Corran

01:29:30.669 --> 01:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
committee thank you members of the
 
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
committee and U
 
01:29:39.070 --> 01:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
chair um my name is Travis corkran and
 
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor of this bill the
 
01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
problem it attempts to solve an educated
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
populace is good for the individual
 
01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
citizen who receives an education and
 
01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
good for Society at large state laws and
 
01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
policies correctly work towards policies
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
that ensure that good educations are ail
 
01:29:54.030 --> 01:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
available however it is always a mistake
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
to measure inputs rather than outputs if
 
01:29:57.950 --> 01:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
we wish to ensure Safe Drinking Water we
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
pass laws and regulations that measure
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
the quality the output uh quality of the
 
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
water and we set standards for that
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
instead it's specifying that a water
 
01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
treatment plant must cost a certain
 
01:30:07.629 --> 01:30:07.639 align:start position:0%
amount and take a certain duration of
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
process per gallon when we wish to
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
ensure safe cars we pass laws and
 
01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
regulations that test the function of
 
01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
brakes and headlights set you know
 
01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:16.280 align:start position:0%
maximum braking distances instead of
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
setting minimum standards for the cost
 
01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
and the time that it takes to uh push a
 
01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
car body through the uh assembly line
 
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
in the case of Education though we have
 
01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:25.639 align:start position:0%
a system that requires certain
 
01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
expenditures and certain hours spent in
 
01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
a chair which ignores the variation in
 
01:30:31.709 --> 01:30:31.719 align:start position:0%
both Talent desires and goals of the
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
individual uh
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
students the existing diversity of
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
approaches New Hampshire state law
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
correctly already supports A diversity
 
01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
of approaches which several
 
01:30:42.189 --> 01:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
Representatives have pointed out and I
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
think uh we're all aware of that and and
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
think that's good um students can either
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
graduate from public school or submit
 
01:30:49.709 --> 01:30:49.719 align:start position:0%
documentation showing that they've
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
completed a homeschooling program um and
 
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
there was a question earlier about the
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
PSATs and um I'm aware of that program
 
01:30:58.149 --> 01:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
and this was drafted with that program
 
01:31:01.149 --> 01:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
and others like it in mind um speaking
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
of homeschooling not all students are
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
lucky enough to have parents who can
 
01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
afford to homeschool them by providing
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
another option which is designed by the
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
Education the test or picking a test we
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
allow those students who wish to
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
accelerate their educations and their
 
01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
lives while still ensuring that they
 
01:31:17.070 --> 01:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrate competence at least as well
 
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
as graduates of the public
 
01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
schools doe statistics show that only 37
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
% of public school students taking
 
01:31:25.149 --> 01:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
assessment tests are rated as proficient
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
or proficient with distinction by Design
 
01:31:29.109 --> 01:31:29.119 align:start position:0%
this bill has a much more stringent
 
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
standard for this New Path than current
 
01:31:32.750 --> 01:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh paths
 
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
require um and by uh giving a high
 
01:31:38.350 --> 01:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
school diploma which is a requirement
 
01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
for college um this uh Bill provides an
 
01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
easy onramp for additional education
 
01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
forcing a student who's capable studying
 
01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
calculus quantum physics or ancient
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
Roman history to sit through high school
 
01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
math and science is a waste of time and
 
01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
money and and finally in terms of state
 
01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
and local spending by allowing some
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
small fraction of students to graduate
 
01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
early we reduce the load on our public
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
schools and school teachers and thus
 
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
either reduce cost to taxpayers or keep
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
costs constant while improving the
 
01:32:05.550 --> 01:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
student to teacher ratio for other
 
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
students there were a few questions of
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
the uh previous um representative that
 
01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to uh address there was one
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
question about line 27 which spoke to a
 
01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh State diploma or a town diploma I
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
understood that question um and it seems
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
enti reasonable to me that if for
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
example the town of you know Hillsboro
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
didn't want their imprint on a
 
01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
particular diploma they said we don't do
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
that to have the state imprint that
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
would be fine and I would certainly uh
 
01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
endorse that when speaking with my
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors your three minutes is up
 
01:32:38.709 --> 01:32:38.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you are there
 
01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative none thank you very much
 
01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time uh I'd
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.639 --> 01:32:52.310 align:start position:0%
 
Williams

01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
Williams
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for allowing me
 
01:32:59.149 --> 01:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
to speak and thank mother nature for
 
01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
allowing me to be here otherwise I would
 
01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
be teaching
 
01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
today um I'm an declared voter I a
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
credential music educator of over three
 
01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
decades who's taught in both public and
 
01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
private schools in two states um I have
 
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
some questions uh we've all
 
01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
heard an outcry over teaching to the
 
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
test over the last few years we can
 
01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
understand understand how one random
 
01:33:25.109 --> 01:33:25.119 align:start position:0%
assessment cannot prepare a student for
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
a post High School let alone a post
 
01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:30.280 align:start position:0%
Middle School uh life in today's
 
01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
high-tech global economy how would the C
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner create such a test with
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
whom would he collaborate Prager you
 
01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
what if Democrats were in charge and
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
they decided to change said test and
 
01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
consult the folks behind I don't know
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
critical race
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
Theory what would be on the test what
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
about those soft skills that employers
 
01:33:52.510 --> 01:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
all across the country are saying they
 
01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:54.280 align:start position:0%
need in their applicants what about
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
social skills how would a random test
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
assess those um we know the human brain
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't fully develop until around age
 
01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
25 and yet we're going to send a bunch
 
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
of middle schoolers out into the
 
01:34:07.109 --> 01:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
workforce um where would the money come
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
from to fund this testing is this a
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
further way to defund public education
 
01:34:14.430 --> 01:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
by diverting tax dollars away from it um
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
here's another question we as educators
 
01:34:18.109 --> 01:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
are legally responsible for our students
 
01:34:20.189 --> 01:34:20.199 align:start position:0%
when we are at work when an active
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
shooter event happens if as we all must
 
01:34:27.109 --> 01:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
in this day and age assume it could how
 
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
will we be able to verify that Johnny is
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
safe during lockdown if he decided not
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
to come to that one class he has because
 
01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
of his get out of school free card and
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
he really doesn't want to go that
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
day this bill is a solution in search of
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
a problem because we already have a
 
01:34:46.189 --> 01:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
flexible system that allows for
 
01:34:48.109 --> 01:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
scenarios that this bill addresses and
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
because it seems to seek to subvert
 
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
existing child labor laws which would
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
bring New Hampshire back to the Dark
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
Ages in conclusion I would just like to
 
01:34:59.669 --> 01:34:59.679 align:start position:0%
point out one fact Donald Trump lost one
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
County in Iowa last night Johnson County
 
01:35:04.629 --> 01:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
the most educated County in Iowa home of
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
the University of Iowa if you think
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
there isn't a correlation between that
 
01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
fact and this bill you're not paying
 
01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
attention I urge the legislature to itl
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and as for Mr corran's comment
 
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
about being worried about my teaching
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
load I can handle the teaching load what
 
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
I can't handle is being
 
01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:28.790 align:start position:0%
I can't handle is being
disrespected

01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
disrespected
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
and having my credentials laughed at by
 
01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
about a third of the
 
01:35:38.109 --> 01:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
population thank you very much are there
 
01:35:40.590 --> 01:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
a question for Mr
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
Williams not see any thank you very much
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
for coming today and braving the weather
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to invite uh Aubrey
 
01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:57.830 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to invite uh Aubrey
Freedman

01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair committee members Aubrey
 
01:36:01.950 --> 01:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
Friedman I live in Bridgewater private
 
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
citizen I'm total in support of this
 
01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:08.360 align:start position:0%
bill the whole point of compulsory
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
education was so that no kids would be
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
missed and that everybody kind of at
 
01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
least gets a a crack at a you know half
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
decent education if some kids are
 
01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
smarter and they can get through the 13
 
01:36:25.709 --> 01:36:25.719 align:start position:0%
years quicker why make them stay there
 
01:36:28.109 --> 01:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
longer what is the point in it they can
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
pass the test they're clearly I think
 
01:36:33.149 --> 01:36:33.159 align:start position:0%
this is a small number of students but
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
even if it were a large number it
 
01:36:36.430 --> 01:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make any point why did they
 
01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
have to stay there longer for a couple
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
more years what's the point in it
 
01:36:44.709 --> 01:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
they've the education has been learned
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
they're ready to move on let's let them
 
01:36:50.189 --> 01:36:50.199 align:start position:0%
move on and clearly uh let them you know
 
01:36:52.109 --> 01:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
as been mentioned maybe they want to
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
start a business start uh learning a
 
01:36:58.750 --> 01:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
trade earlier uh invent something who
 
01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
knows there's genius there why
 
01:37:05.470 --> 01:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
kill uh I hate to say but the standard
 
01:37:08.229 --> 01:37:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh model of government schools is one
 
01:37:11.070 --> 01:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
size fits all if you're stuck in there
 
01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
and clearly it doesn't apply to
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
everybody and I think this kills the
 
01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
learning spirit that you know young kids
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
have you know kids children they have
 
01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:22.360 align:start position:0%
that and and if they haven't killed if
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
they haven't lost it by the time they're
 
01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
say I don't know 15 or 16 let's let it
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
alive let it Thrive so if they've done
 
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
their job they've learned the stuff let
 
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
them out early um there just no reason
 
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
to keep them there longer in my opinion
 
01:37:43.189 --> 01:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
um the one thing that did bother me a
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
little bit on this bill that I think
 
01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:47.159 align:start position:0%
could be improved it's a small it's
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
minor there will be some cost of course
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
but uh I'm a real
 
01:37:54.430 --> 01:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
and so I took the real estate exam New
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Real Estate Commission I
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
didn't take it at their office it was
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
actually taken in an H H&amp;R Block office
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
they had uh you know they must have
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
contracted up they've got testing
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
centers all over the state probably all
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
over the country and so there's no
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
reason it has to be done at the
 
01:38:15.790 --> 01:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Education getting special
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
equipment space and all that when I went
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
in they check you out you empty your
 
01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:21.679 align:start position:0%
pockets you practically take your
 
01:38:24.189 --> 01:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
clothes off they got cameras I was
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
afraid to go to the bathroom during the
 
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
test because I don't know what they have
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
to do so it's it can be regulated and
 
01:38:34.589 --> 01:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
surveilled so there's no Shenanigans and
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to set up a whole I
 
01:38:39.550 --> 01:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
mean there will be a few extra costs and
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
organizing it but I don't think the
 
01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
costs that are listed here are really
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
realistic it can be contracted at a much
 
01:38:49.470 --> 01:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
smaller cost it's a very minor problem I
 
01:38:51.589 --> 01:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
see the kids are ready if they're ready
 
01:38:55.870 --> 01:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
to go and also the question about age uh
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
comes up two-year-olds are not going to
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
I don't think be able to pass the test
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
but let's say the adolescence some kids
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
would be ready and I say um it's up to
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
the parents if they say the kid is not
 
01:39:10.430 --> 01:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
mature enough to move on then they're
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
not going to let them do that your time

Young

01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
Young
 
01:39:54.109 --> 01:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
was at the time before homeschooling was
 
01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
legal I went because I was told my
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
parents would be imprisoned and I would
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
be put in reform school if I didn't show
 
01:40:04.510 --> 01:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
up government school and I didn't get
 
01:40:07.589 --> 01:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
along I made no trouble I just didn't do
 
01:40:10.669 --> 01:40:10.679 align:start position:0%
their homework year after Soul crushing
 
01:40:14.350 --> 01:40:14.360 align:start position:0%
year so they gave me a lot of tests one
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
of those tests was the
 
01:40:19.589 --> 01:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
GED I didn't know it at the time I
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
passed and when I did find out I asked
 
01:40:26.830 --> 01:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
for my GED so I could get out of high
 
01:40:29.950 --> 01:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
school I was told that I was not allowed
 
01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
to get a GED until after my class had
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
graduated this confirmed to me that high
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
school had nothing to do with education
 
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
it was a matter of serving my full
 
01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:42.830 align:start position:0%
it was a matter of serving my full
prison

01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
prison
 
01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:44.550 align:start position:0%

sentence

01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
hb142 makes a way for students like me
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
to escape from something that does no
 
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
one any good it reaffirms the idea that
 
01:40:56.109 --> 01:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
high school is about learning since if
 
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
the student has already learned it why
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
would they be require be required to be
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
there HB 1402 provides a way for
 
01:41:06.030 --> 01:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
students who are mismatched to the Aged
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
based age-based grades of the government
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
schools to prove their bonafides and
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
move on to doing something which better
 
01:41:16.109 --> 01:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
serves their needs and skills than being
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
locked in prison until they too reach
 
01:41:21.390 --> 01:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
their time served
 
01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:22.149 align:start position:0%
their time served

relative to eligibility for preschool
 
01:53:03.629 --> 01:53:03.639 align:start position:0%

hall for the record I'm Uriel Hall and I

represent the fine people of bow and
 
01:53:10.030 --> 01:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
hackington and as representative luno
 
01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
would often say as well as all Gran
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
Staters feeding kids at school is at the
 
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
heart of House Bill 1212 which has a
 
01:53:20.430 --> 01:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal note as well as a local note
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
the attent of this bill which
 
01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:24.030 align:start position:0%
the attent of this bill which
representative

01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
Myers Myer always tells us it which is
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
important we need to know the intent
 
01:53:32.189 --> 01:53:32.199 align:start position:0%
it's three-fold one to help support low
 
01:53:34.270 --> 01:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
to Middle inome families by raising a
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
single eligibility cap to 350% of
 
01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
poverty two to cast a broader net beyond
 
01:53:42.750 --> 01:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
the federal guidelines to capture more
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
students to ensure that as many students
 
01:53:47.310 --> 01:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
as possible receive at least one
 
01:53:49.950 --> 01:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
preferably two nutritious meals per day
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
day and three for the state to cover the
 
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
additional costs associated with these
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
increases as we know School meals play a
 
01:54:01.149 --> 01:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
critical role in the student health
 
01:54:04.069 --> 01:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
well-being and academic success a
 
01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
healthy diet can give a child the energy
 
01:54:09.870 --> 01:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
to think work and play food insecurity
 
01:54:12.390 --> 01:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
puts tremendous stress on families who
 
01:54:14.189 --> 01:54:14.199 align:start position:0%
are struggling to hit their basic needs
 
01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:16.679 align:start position:0%
budgets given the increased cost of food
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
as well as Child Care Health Care
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
Transportation housing
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
utilities what does 350% of poverty look
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
like a family of four with an annual
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
income of up to 30,000 is deemed to be
 
01:54:31.149 --> 01:54:31.159 align:start position:0%
living in poverty if that same family
 
01:54:34.669 --> 01:54:34.679 align:start position:0%
has an annual income of up to 105,000
 
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
they would qualify for free School meals
 
01:54:41.069 --> 01:54:41.079 align:start position:0%
given a 350% poverty eligibility cap in
 
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note the department noted
 
01:54:46.189 --> 01:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
that the fiscal impact of this program
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
is indeterminable at this time the same
 
01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
thing we heard last year
 
01:54:52.270 --> 01:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
but expected to be significant I think
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
the numbers that they gave are rather
 
01:54:57.149 --> 01:54:57.159 align:start position:0%
excessive they they seem pretty high to
 
01:55:00.430 --> 01:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
me but uh secondly the program would
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
have local impli implications I checked
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
with my local um assistant
 
01:55:07.149 --> 01:55:07.159 align:start position:0%
superintendent business manager and he
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to think that the um that
 
01:55:12.589 --> 01:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
the burden on the local would be very
 
01:55:14.669 --> 01:55:14.679 align:start position:0%
much you know some some more paperwork
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
he didn't even think it would involve uh
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
additional personnel and thirdly the
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
cost to develop a process for
 
01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility determinations to implement
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
and manage the program would cost nearly
 
01:55:29.189 --> 01:55:29.199 align:start position:0%
a half million dollar according to doe
 
01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's $100,000 for a database system
 
01:55:34.830 --> 01:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
which is probably reasonable I guess I
 
01:55:36.510 --> 01:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
don't know and
 
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
339,000 for at least three new positions
 
01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
at the doe three people is going to take
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
the manager's program I'm not sure what
 
01:55:45.709 --> 01:55:45.719 align:start position:0%
they're all doing with technology today
 
01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
but that's what um doe is here today so
 
01:55:51.229 --> 01:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
maybe she can respond respond to that um
 
01:55:53.629 --> 01:55:53.639 align:start position:0%
we cannot let an indeterminable cost
 
01:55:56.069 --> 01:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
stop us from moving forward our job in
 
01:55:57.709 --> 01:55:57.719 align:start position:0%
the education committee is to create
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
policy which meets the educational needs
 
01:56:02.589 --> 01:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
of students and to let Finance decide if
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
and how will be funded I urge you to
 
01:56:07.629 --> 01:56:07.639 align:start position:0%
support our house bill 1212 which will
 
01:56:09.069 --> 01:56:09.079 align:start position:0%
help ensure that students have the
 
01:56:11.310 --> 01:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
nourishment they need to learn while
 
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
taking some Financial pressures off
 
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
families I understand that it might be a
 
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
challenge to determine eligibility and
 
01:56:19.870 --> 01:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
to fund this Implement and manage this
 
01:56:22.030 --> 01:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
program but I would argue that hungry
 
01:56:24.750 --> 01:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
children face a far greater Challenge
 
01:56:27.149 --> 01:56:27.159 align:start position:0%
and with that I will take any questions
 
01:56:28.669 --> 01:56:28.679 align:start position:0%
knowing that these folks back here
 
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
probably have a lot more answers than I
 
01:56:31.149 --> 01:56:31.159 align:start position:0%
have thank you very much representative
 
01:56:34.030 --> 01:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
Hall are questions yes representative
 
01:56:36.069 --> 01:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr shair and thank you
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
for your testimony um we've just heard
 
01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
that uh this bill would uh prescribe
 
01:56:43.390 --> 01:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
that schools provide two free meals per
 
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
day under the bill um and you testified
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
that the fiscal note seems to to be
 
01:56:53.310 --> 01:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
excessive maybe too high however the
 
01:56:56.069 --> 01:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal note says this bill does not
 
01:56:57.950 --> 01:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
specify which meal is to be provided the
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
cost of a breakfast meal differs from
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
the cost of a lunch meal so the fiscal
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
note is only for one meal per day so
 
01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
isn't it likely that the fiscal note is
 
01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
under what this would actually be if
 
01:57:09.709 --> 01:57:09.719 align:start position:0%
we're providing two
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
meals the fiscal note said 50 to uh
 
01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
75 million I think it was
 
01:57:21.310 --> 01:57:21.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm not on that so actually I think
 
01:57:22.750 --> 01:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
that those numbers are excessive for two
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
meals a day 7 not the 50 but the 75 is
 
01:57:29.069 --> 01:57:29.079 align:start position:0%
what seems excessive to me thank you
 
01:57:30.350 --> 01:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you if I if I may have just one
 
01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:33.719 align:start position:0%
more brief one um you may be surprised
 
01:57:35.189 --> 01:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
to learn I'm not totally opposed to the
 
01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
idea of providing a uh New Hampshire
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
funded remal to students however I have
 
01:57:45.229 --> 01:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
big hesitations with um what is
 
01:57:47.069 --> 01:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
currently provided because I hear all
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
the time that the quality of the food is
 
01:57:51.229 --> 01:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
not there that it's not good and it's
 
01:57:52.350 --> 01:57:52.360 align:start position:0%
based on the federal government
 
01:57:53.870 --> 01:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines so my question is if we're
 
01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
going to be paying with New Hampshire
 
01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money for this free meal do we
 
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
get to set the standards and go our own
 
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
way to make sure these are good healthy
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
meals or do we have to follow Federal
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
USDA guidelines even though we're paying
 
01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:09.830 align:start position:0%
USDA guidelines even though we're paying
for

01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
this thank you for the question I would
 
01:58:14.589 --> 01:58:14.599 align:start position:0%
say we have to follow federal guidelines
 
01:58:16.430 --> 01:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
which I can't answer I know
 
01:58:18.750 --> 01:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
representative Damon's an expert on this
 
01:58:21.189 --> 01:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of what's offered for Jee
 
01:58:23.310 --> 01:58:23.320 align:start position:0%
this is crazy um the federal guidelines
 
01:58:24.669 --> 01:58:24.679 align:start position:0%
but I think at this point you have to
 
01:58:26.350 --> 01:58:26.360 align:start position:0%
follow the federal guidelines because
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's the federal program to use use your
 
01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:30.790 align:start position:0%
it's the federal program to use use your
mic

01:58:30.790 --> 01:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
mic
 
01:58:35.350 --> 01:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
please we are there are there further
 
01:58:38.229 --> 01:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent Damon thank you
 
01:58:40.069 --> 01:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
Mr chair this is actually just a point
 
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
of clarification the bill does not
 
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
specify two meals per day it specifies
 
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
at least one so uh representative

belcher's remarks about the fiscal
 
01:58:54.109 --> 01:58:54.119 align:start position:0%

01:58:57.229 --> 01:58:57.239 align:start position:0%
bill says one meal are there any

provided you with a summary of the

research on school the benefits of
 
02:01:12.069 --> 02:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
School meals hb212 would raise
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
eligibility for free school meales to
 
02:01:16.430 --> 02:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
350% of the federal poverty level
 
02:01:18.430 --> 02:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
currently eligibility for free males is
 
02:01:21.790 --> 02:01:21.800 align:start position:0%
set at 13% of the federal poverty level
 
02:01:24.750 --> 02:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
for a family of three 130% of the
 
02:01:27.149 --> 02:01:27.159 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level is an annual
 
02:01:28.350 --> 02:01:28.360 align:start position:0%
income of
 
02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:30.390 align:start position:0%
income of
$323

02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
$323
 
02:01:33.870 --> 02:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
18 since an income of over twice that is
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
needed to support a family of three we
 
02:01:39.109 --> 02:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
know that current eligibility levels
 
02:01:41.629 --> 02:01:41.639 align:start position:0%
exclude many hardworking families in New
 
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from accessing critical
 
02:01:46.030 --> 02:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
support and it means that many children
 
02:01:48.750 --> 02:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
are hungry at school we often aren't
 
02:01:50.990 --> 02:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
aware of how widespread Financial
 
02:01:53.229 --> 02:01:53.239 align:start position:0%
challenges are across the state some
 
02:01:55.229 --> 02:01:55.239 align:start position:0%
time ago it was made clear to me when I
 
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
was in the waiting room of one of my
 
02:01:59.149 --> 02:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
medical providers and I overheard two
 
02:02:01.709 --> 02:02:01.719 align:start position:0%
receptionists talking to each other one
 
02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
of them said to the other she was very
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
distressed and she said that her
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
Children's School had told her that her
 
02:02:08.589 --> 02:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
children weren't eligible for free
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
introduced meals the receptionist said
 
02:02:13.350 --> 02:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
she made too much money she said they
 
02:02:15.229 --> 02:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
don't know about all our expenses
 
02:02:17.189 --> 02:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to consider those
 
02:02:19.870 --> 02:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
it's just based on income so here was a
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
woman with a full-time reliable job in a
 
02:02:24.109 --> 02:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
professional office still having trouble
 
02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
ensuring that her children had enough to
 
02:02:27.629 --> 02:02:27.639 align:start position:0%
eat and she's not
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
alone we all agree that children should
 
02:02:32.310 --> 02:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
have equal opportunities to succeed in
 
02:02:34.669 --> 02:02:34.679 align:start position:0%
school and life we accept that all
 
02:02:36.589 --> 02:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
children to have transportation to
 
02:02:39.550 --> 02:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
school access to books and facilities
 
02:02:42.030 --> 02:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
and infrastructure they need to learn we
 
02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
don't provide these resources based on a
 
02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
family's income access to meals is even
 
02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
more fundamental to Student Success us
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
children can't learn if they're hungry I
 
02:02:54.910 --> 02:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
want to clarify that this bill does not
 
02:02:57.189 --> 02:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
affect the state school funding formula
 
02:02:59.069 --> 02:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
which allocates differential Aid based
 
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
on free and reduced meals at the federal
 
02:03:04.109 --> 02:03:04.119 align:start position:0%
level if the committee were to vote for
 
02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
this spill if it were to pass it would
 
02:03:10.030 --> 02:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
not affect the state school F funding
 
02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:11.669 align:start position:0%
not affect the state school F funding
formula

02:03:11.669 --> 02:03:11.679 align:start position:0%
formula
 
02:03:14.149 --> 02:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
um this bill is investment in New
 
02:03:16.270 --> 02:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's future please vote out to
 
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
pass on hb212 because every child
 
02:03:22.589 --> 02:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
deserves an equal chance at success in
 
02:03:24.870 --> 02:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
school thank you thank you very much
 
02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
that's just about three minutes good job
 
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh are there questions yes
 
02:03:34.229 --> 02:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
02:03:36.430 --> 02:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:03:39.229 --> 02:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify um I was trying to
 
02:03:41.669 --> 02:03:41.679 align:start position:0%
take notes and I missed your part that
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
said about food insecurity the the
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
number of children in that could you
 
02:03:49.470 --> 02:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
repeat that for me sure so
 
02:03:51.629 --> 02:03:51.639 align:start position:0%
um so these numbers come from the Census
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
household pulse survey which is a survey
 
02:03:56.830 --> 02:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
that's done by the census uh it's a
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
telephone survey they call into States

the end of October of
 
02:04:07.589 --> 02:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
2023 over half of New Hampshire children
 
02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
lived in households that reported having
 
02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:13.030 align:start position:0%
lived in households that reported having
insufficient

02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
food do you know how large a datab base
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
you know this is how many Families how
 
02:04:21.790 --> 02:04:21.800 align:start position:0%
many people um we're talking about what
 
02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
that translates to um it's on our

02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
02:04:46.870 --> 02:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you CH good morning good
 
02:04:48.549 --> 02:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
morning still morning thank you uh just
 
02:04:51.149 --> 02:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
quick question related but not directly
 
02:04:52.350 --> 02:04:52.360 align:start position:0%
do you happen to know from your
 
02:04:55.669 --> 02:04:55.679 align:start position:0%
experience on the ballpark figure that
 
02:04:57.790 --> 02:04:57.800 align:start position:0%
it cost for the universal males when no
 
02:04:59.950 --> 02:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
hand had the
 
02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:01.589 align:start position:0%
hand had the
covid

02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
covid
 
02:05:04.270 --> 02:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
so I let me see if I thank you for the
 
02:05:06.030 --> 02:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
question let me see if I understand so
 
02:05:08.750 --> 02:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
are you asking me what it would cost to
 
02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
provide Universal meal you happen to
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
have the data on what New Hampshire cost
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
in Hampshire during the co period when
 
02:05:15.390 --> 02:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
they had Universal meals for all
 
02:05:17.950 --> 02:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
youngsters so during that period of
 
02:05:19.390 --> 02:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
course there were there were Federal
 
02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
waivers the federal government the
 
02:05:23.549 --> 02:05:23.559 align:start position:0%
federal government paid for all the food
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
costs during that per what what that
 
02:05:29.390 --> 02:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
cost was so um I I would defer to my
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
colleagues at the de at the Department
 
02:05:34.589 --> 02:05:34.599 align:start position:0%
of Education but I can tell you that um
 
02:05:37.470 --> 02:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that's on the current
 
02:05:40.990 --> 02:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
bill 1212 assumes that all children
 
02:05:43.629 --> 02:05:43.639 align:start position:0%
would participate um and would eat all
 
02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
meals at school I assume I I I you would
 
02:05:48.990 --> 02:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
have to ask them but that's not what
 
02:05:51.149 --> 02:05:51.159 align:start position:0%
happened during the pandemic when uh
 
02:05:52.910 --> 02:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
there were waivers that allowed for all
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
children to eat free meals at school it
 
02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
was about 70% of the kids
 
02:06:03.629 --> 02:06:03.639 align:start position:0%
um between 60 and 70% of the kids um ate
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
lunch at school and about 45% ate
 
02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
breakfast at school okay thank you and I
 
02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
can I I'll email you the ex the right
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
numbers but that's my memory I think
 
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
it thank I think I heard uh last year in
 
02:06:19.390 --> 02:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
the testimony for a similar not similar
 
02:06:21.549 --> 02:06:21.559 align:start position:0%
different percentage um was 111 million
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
but I didn't have trying to recall
 
02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:24.470 align:start position:0%
but I didn't have trying to recall
accurate

02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
02:06:26.910 --> 02:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
data than you I believe that was the
 
02:06:28.350 --> 02:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
estimate from from the Department of
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
Education last year without Universal
 
02:06:32.790 --> 02:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
meals great thank you thank you Mr
 
02:06:34.270 --> 02:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
you're welcome further questions from
 
02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:35.430 align:start position:0%
you're welcome further questions from
the

02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:06:37.950 --> 02:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
02:06:40.669 --> 02:06:40.679 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:47.599 --> 02:06:52.510 align:start position:0%
 
fredman

02:06:52.510 --> 02:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair committee members Aubrey
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
fredman again um Bridgewater I speak in
 
02:06:59.589 --> 02:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill and I believe
 
02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
I've uh testified against similar bills
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
in the past and we'll do so again in the
 
02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
future um I'm not opposed to food or
 
02:07:09.790 --> 02:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
eating or healthful eating or anything
 
02:07:12.870 --> 02:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
like that um we already have the program
 
02:07:16.750 --> 02:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
for the lower income to cover that this
 
02:07:20.910 --> 02:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
is clearly going up 300 50% 105,000
 
02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
we're going into the middle class now
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
and I feel I lived in a an expensive
 
02:07:28.750 --> 02:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
city before when I was raising my son
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
years ago middle I had a middle class
 
02:07:35.109 --> 02:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
income uh and very expensive city and I
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%
was able to pay I send you know a bad
 
02:07:40.350 --> 02:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
lunch and when he got older he had to
 
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
make his own lunch and if he didn't feel
 
02:07:43.950 --> 02:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
like doing it that's his problem so it
 
02:07:46.990 --> 02:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
was my responsibility not my neighbors
 
02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
or the taxpayers and and when you're
 
02:07:51.229 --> 02:07:51.239 align:start position:0%
going into the middle class here that's
 
02:07:56.910 --> 02:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
the problem um you know uh what else can
 
02:07:58.629 --> 02:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
I say about yeah actually there's a
 
02:08:02.109 --> 02:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
moral hazard here where it be it goes
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
into uh if you are get getting U help
 
02:08:09.870 --> 02:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
from say uh food banks or churches
 
02:08:12.189 --> 02:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
people feel grateful when they get it
 
02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
from the government it becomes M becomes
 
02:08:19.830 --> 02:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
kind of a an entitlement right
 
02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
um infrastructure I've even heard that
 
02:08:24.149 --> 02:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
term used too so that's the problem it's
 
02:08:26.549 --> 02:08:26.559 align:start position:0%
a moral hazard here and I'm telling you
 
02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
once you get these things started you
 
02:08:30.510 --> 02:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
can't get them stopped people get used
 
02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
to the goodies and they like them they
 
02:08:33.709 --> 02:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
get used to them and they think that's
 
02:08:37.870 --> 02:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
the way it should be cost 75 million
 
02:08:39.510 --> 02:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay whether it's high or low whatever
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
it is it's going to be a tremendous cost
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
where is the money going to come from
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
you got to raise the taxes that makes
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
everything more expensive for every body
 
02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
the same people that you're supposed to
 
02:08:55.390 --> 02:08:55.400 align:start position:0%
be trying to help so I nothing is free
 
02:08:57.629 --> 02:08:57.639 align:start position:0%
uh that's the problem and I think this
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
just has a bad uh as I say moral hazard
 
02:09:03.910 --> 02:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to become more
 
02:09:05.669 --> 02:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
dependent on government we should be
 
02:09:08.189 --> 02:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
encouraging them to be prosperous and
 
02:09:10.629 --> 02:09:10.639 align:start position:0%
take care of their own families personal
 
02:09:13.709 --> 02:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
responsibility that's key here not
 
02:09:17.069 --> 02:09:17.079 align:start position:0%
dependency and lastly um I don't think
 
02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
this is going to solve the childhood
 
02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
obesity problem so I you know there's
 
02:09:25.069 --> 02:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
you hear a lot in the news about that so
 
02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
how's this going to solve that problem
 
02:09:29.430 --> 02:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
and those are my thoughts thank you very
 
02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
much are there questions from the
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
committee not see any thank you very
 
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%

you turn
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%

02:10:15.229 --> 02:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
speaking in support of this
 
02:10:18.350 --> 02:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
bill uh not just because it would help
 
02:10:19.950 --> 02:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
students would dispos because it would
 
02:10:21.149 --> 02:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
help all
 
02:10:23.629 --> 02:10:23.639 align:start position:0%
students many different surveys many
 
02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
different uh Studies have found that
 
02:10:29.950 --> 02:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
preschool meals have positive effects
 
02:10:32.030 --> 02:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
both socially and academically for
 
02:10:34.549 --> 02:10:34.559 align:start position:0%
students receiving
 
02:10:37.669 --> 02:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
them a uh study from the Journal of the
 
02:10:40.189 --> 02:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
academic sorry Academy of nutrition and
 
02:10:42.149 --> 02:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
dietetics found that students who
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
received on-site meals and snacks
 
02:10:45.390 --> 02:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
provided by their child care center had
 
02:10:47.830 --> 02:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
higher chances of being food secure are
 
02:10:49.790 --> 02:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
more like likely to be in good health
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
and had lower odds of being admitted to
 
02:10:54.629 --> 02:10:54.639 align:start position:0%
a hospital from an Emer emergency
 
02:10:56.109 --> 02:10:56.119 align:start position:0%
department excuse
 
02:10:59.069 --> 02:10:59.079 align:start position:0%
me there also been found that preschool
 
02:11:01.709 --> 02:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
Mills have increased scores in
 
02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
mathematics English and many other
 
02:11:10.069 --> 02:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
subjects uh and in general it allows for
 
02:11:12.310 --> 02:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
students to be able to go throughout the
 
02:11:14.350 --> 02:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
day without worrying about where their
 
02:11:17.470 --> 02:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
food's going to come from cuz uh as we
 
02:11:19.390 --> 02:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
all know the middle class has become a
 
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
bit more stretched on their expenses
 
02:11:24.069 --> 02:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
recently and that has really hurt some
 
02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
families when it comes to trying to feed
 
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
their children which is a number one
 
02:11:29.350 --> 02:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
goal for many families to make sure they
 
02:11:31.709 --> 02:11:31.719 align:start position:0%
can go throughout their days not
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
worrying about what they're going to eat
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
not worrying about if they can get the
 
02:11:36.510 --> 02:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
right amount of
 
02:11:39.510 --> 02:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
nutrition try to keep it short and
 
02:11:43.030 --> 02:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
sweet any questions one happy answer
 
02:11:44.189 --> 02:11:44.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions
 
02:11:46.589 --> 02:11:46.599 align:start position:0%
representative beler thank you Mr chair
 
02:11:47.709 --> 02:11:47.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here for this I'm
 
02:11:49.669 --> 02:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
hoping you might be able to answer this
 
02:11:52.750 --> 02:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
because I hear I hear the phrase uh food
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
insecurity a lot I feel like it's a
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
little bit nebulous do you happen to
 
02:12:00.430 --> 02:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
have a stat for um what percentage of
 
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire children are malnourished
 
02:12:04.990 --> 02:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
or nutrient
 
02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
deficient uh thank you for the question
 
02:12:09.669 --> 02:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
I don't have that off the top of my head
 
02:12:12.390 --> 02:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
but I can say that child poverty is on
 
02:12:16.069 --> 02:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
the rise and that has a big link to uh
 
02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh malnutrition uh in 20 1 it was 5%
 
02:12:21.950 --> 02:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
across the country now it's up to 12%
 
02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
which is a more than 100% rise and as
 
02:12:27.149 --> 02:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
you know is people have less money they
 
02:12:28.870 --> 02:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
can feed people less they can feed less
 
02:12:30.790 --> 02:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
nutritionally uh and to your point
 
02:12:33.069 --> 02:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
earlier uh you talked about USDA
 
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines for nutrition uh I have a
 
02:12:36.790 --> 02:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
masters in Community Development that's
 
02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
one of the big things we talked about is
 
02:12:41.470 --> 02:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
uh the function of USDA guidelines uh
 
02:12:44.109 --> 02:12:44.119 align:start position:0%
when it comes to nutrition uh I
 
02:12:45.870 --> 02:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
personally would be in support of
 
02:12:48.669 --> 02:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
anything that would find a way to ensure
 
02:12:51.310 --> 02:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
that more children have nutritious
 
02:12:54.510 --> 02:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
meals thank you other further questions
 
02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
not see thank you very much thank you we
 
02:13:00.030 --> 02:13:00.040 align:start position:0%

Ry thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:14:06.149 --> 02:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm still trying to wrap my head
 
02:14:08.910 --> 02:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
around um the part about over half of
 
02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire children and 40% 6% of
 
02:14:13.790 --> 02:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
adults lived in households that reported
 
02:14:16.270 --> 02:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
having insufficient food do you have
 
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
data on that
 
02:14:20.830 --> 02:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
um we do not have data on those stats as
 
02:14:22.990 --> 02:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
they were not provided by us but we can
 
02:14:26.510 --> 02:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
look into that thank you yes
 
02:14:28.990 --> 02:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you and
 
02:14:31.709 --> 02:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
good morning thanks for being here um my
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
question is regarding the fiscal note
 
02:14:34.709 --> 02:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
because it says a department was
 
02:14:37.790 --> 02:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
contacted it's the only agency listed um
 
02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
could you provide any clarification on
 
02:14:42.030 --> 02:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
how these numbers came about and someone
 
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
said they might be too high or just
 
02:14:45.910 --> 02:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
overall what is that about thank you
 
02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question um the
 
02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
piece of paper that was passed around
 
02:14:54.430 --> 02:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
just for um for context um is the amount
 
02:14:57.270 --> 02:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
that it would cost for all students um
 
02:14:59.629 --> 02:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
less the the federal reimbursement so
 
02:15:02.990 --> 02:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's about um
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
a22 million um number so just to put it
 
02:15:10.229 --> 02:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
in context um so that the $50 million
 
02:15:12.589 --> 02:15:12.599 align:start position:0%
that's in the the fiscal note um is a
 
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
minimum amount that would be needed um
 
02:15:18.470 --> 02:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
for for this bill um
 
02:15:20.430 --> 02:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
and the piece of paper that is passed
 
02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
around um would be if um all students
 
02:15:28.350 --> 02:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
were to eat that are enrolled in um
 
02:15:29.709 --> 02:15:29.719 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire and it's
 
02:15:31.549 --> 02:15:31.559 align:start position:0%
important to have that context and that
 
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
number to know that's the maximum amount
 
02:15:36.669 --> 02:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
um that it could cost um because to make
 
02:15:39.470 --> 02:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
sure that all students have access to to
 
02:15:42.790 --> 02:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
those meals that number needs to be
 
02:15:46.470 --> 02:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
provided further represent Woodcock sh
 
02:15:49.790 --> 02:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
good morning welcome back ual um I just
 
02:15:51.589 --> 02:15:51.599 align:start position:0%
want to be clear on two things if I may
 
02:15:51.599 --> 02:15:52.430 align:start position:0%
want to be clear on two things if I may
the

02:15:52.430 --> 02:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:54.430 --> 02:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
12283 at the bottom of the the data
 
02:15:56.109 --> 02:15:56.119 align:start position:0%
sheet now that's that's what you're
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
talking about would be projected cost of
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
universal meals for all youngsters
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay minus the current
 
02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
amount that the state is already paying
 
02:16:07.310 --> 02:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
for the reduced price breakfast okay
 
02:16:10.910 --> 02:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:14.270 --> 02:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
so how much do the state get back um
 
02:16:16.109 --> 02:16:16.119 align:start position:0%
annually from the and maybe I'm
 
02:16:18.350 --> 02:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
misreading this from the ement from the
 
02:16:20.390 --> 02:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
federal government for their part of the
 
02:16:23.629 --> 02:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
meals program so um it's based off of
 
02:16:26.669 --> 02:16:26.679 align:start position:0%
meals served right so I could get the
 
02:16:28.750 --> 02:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
the exact number um during covid it was
 
02:16:30.750 --> 02:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
about $50 million that we were pushing
 
02:16:32.910 --> 02:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
out um for those meals from the federal
 
02:16:36.429 --> 02:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
government um for that and we have
 
02:16:40.230 --> 02:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
transitioned back to about $30 million
 
02:16:42.669 --> 02:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
um that we would push out and get back
 
02:16:45.750 --> 02:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
from from the federal government for
 
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um so that would be uh ke that
 
02:16:51.190 --> 02:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
would be reduced from the the
 
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
122 is that right that's correct again
 
02:16:57.309 --> 02:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
this number is is based on all if meals
 
02:16:59.750 --> 02:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
were available to all students because
 
02:17:02.230 --> 02:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
yeah we want to make sure that um if the
 
02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
state were to cover the cost that all
 
02:17:05.790 --> 02:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
students who were enrolled had access to
 
02:17:06.750 --> 02:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
so that would be considered like the
 
02:17:09.669 --> 02:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
universal pre-co meal correct okay so
 
02:17:10.990 --> 02:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
since the third T I'm really kind of
 
02:17:14.270 --> 02:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
stupid here today uh don't ask much um
 
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
so this the 122 is excluding any
 
02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
reimburse from the federal government
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's correct you can see that the um
 
02:17:25.629 --> 02:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
in the let's call it the third column um
 
02:17:27.669 --> 02:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
that's the the cost of the meal minus
 
02:17:30.030 --> 02:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
the the federal reimbursement so so it'
 
02:17:33.030 --> 02:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
be 50 million less than that with the
 
02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:34.790 align:start position:0%
be 50 million less than that with the
federal

02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:17:36.830 --> 02:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and that that's I'm
 
02:17:38.830 --> 02:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
getting confused here no so so this
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
number here the 122 is after the federal
 
02:17:45.549 --> 02:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so yeah so if there was no
 
02:17:47.309 --> 02:17:47.319 align:start position:0%
federal reimbursement at all if the
 
02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
state um just to put it in for context
 
02:17:51.389 --> 02:17:51.399 align:start position:0%
if the state were to cover all the costs
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
and they didn't want to be on the USDA
 
02:17:56.750 --> 02:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
program it would be a significant amount
 
02:17:58.469 --> 02:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
more because you wouldn't be getting
 
02:18:00.389 --> 02:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
that reimbursement from from the federal
 
02:18:02.429 --> 02:18:02.439 align:start position:0%
government I don't have that number I I
 
02:18:04.190 --> 02:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
could get it for you if that's what you
 
02:18:05.669 --> 02:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
want but this is after the federal
 
02:18:09.469 --> 02:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
reimbursement okay so 12 okay thank you
 
02:18:11.790 --> 02:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
this is the last followup well yeah it's
 
02:18:15.389 --> 02:18:15.399 align:start position:0%
math it's math I know it's I got
 
02:18:18.990 --> 02:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
it so 122 is the total number now for
 
02:18:21.429 --> 02:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
Universal correct thank you thank you
 
02:18:23.309 --> 02:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
chair I I do have a question I'd like to
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
ask you uh we have 38 schools that are
 
02:18:27.150 --> 02:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
not participating either the national
 
02:18:29.070 --> 02:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
school lunch program or the National
 
02:18:32.030 --> 02:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
School breakfast program would this bill
 
02:18:34.349 --> 02:18:34.359 align:start position:0%
cost additional costs of any kind for
 
02:18:37.270 --> 02:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
those particular 38 schools if they are
 
02:18:39.309 --> 02:18:39.319 align:start position:0%
not included in the enrollment at the
 
02:18:41.629 --> 02:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
Department of Education then yes I don't
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
have that that specific um cuz I don't
 
02:18:45.790 --> 02:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
have those schools off the top of my
 
02:18:47.230 --> 02:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
head but if they're not included with
 
02:18:49.349 --> 02:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
the enrollment then that would be above
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
and beyond because we use the enrollment
 
02:18:52.309 --> 02:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
numbers that we currently have at the
 
02:18:54.429 --> 02:18:54.439 align:start position:0%
department okay thank you Choice
 
02:18:54.439 --> 02:18:55.309 align:start position:0%
department okay thank you Choice
represent

02:18:55.309 --> 02:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:18:57.429 --> 02:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
for this technical help so I'm citing
 
02:19:01.349 --> 02:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
and looking at um the national instit of
 
02:19:03.549 --> 02:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
Health looking at a study um National
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
School launch program has been Guided by
 
02:19:06.509 --> 02:19:06.519 align:start position:0%
Modest nutrient standards and the
 
02:19:08.110 --> 02:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
palatability of meals which drives
 
02:19:09.669 --> 02:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
consumption receives inadequate
 
02:19:12.910 --> 02:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
attention this is a study on food waste
 
02:19:15.429 --> 02:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
out of Boston that demonstrated that in
 
02:19:18.589 --> 02:19:18.599 align:start position:0%
Boston middle schools rough
 
02:19:22.629 --> 02:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
30% of uh food was wasted it was thrown
 
02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
away um do we have any idea what the
 
02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
number is look like here in New
 
02:19:29.389 --> 02:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for that food waste thank you
 
02:19:31.549 --> 02:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
for the question it's not currently data
 
02:19:33.750 --> 02:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
that we we collect at the department it
 
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
there could be some at the local level
 
02:19:36.910 --> 02:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
but that's not um current data we have
 
02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
at the
 
02:19:40.589 --> 02:19:40.599 align:start position:0%
department are there further questions
 
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to get 15 16 in
 
02:19:46.190 --> 02:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
before lunch here so represent bbon
 
02:19:47.629 --> 02:19:47.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for take
 
02:19:49.790 --> 02:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
with my question um could you remind me
 
02:19:52.710 --> 02:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
about what what are the guidelines for
 
02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh reduced lunch versus free lunch the
 
02:20:01.710 --> 02:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
income levels sure the um the free is
 
02:20:06.309 --> 02:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:08.790 --> 02:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
185% thank you you're welcome other
 
02:20:11.070 --> 02:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
questions are there more handouts I just
 
02:20:14.349 --> 02:20:14.359 align:start position:0%
never got them here if it got held
 
02:20:18.630 --> 02:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
up yeah yeah see I didn't get one either
 
02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
we will I apologize about that we will
 
02:20:22.590 --> 02:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
also send digital copies so that
 
02:20:25.469 --> 02:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
everybody can have a copy of them yeah
 
02:20:26.910 --> 02:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
okay further questions from the
 
02:20:28.590 --> 02:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
committee representative Cornell thank
 
02:20:31.070 --> 02:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
you and thank you Kelly I I'm just
 
02:20:34.190 --> 02:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
confused about the cost 122 million
 
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
would be Universal that's feeding
 
02:20:38.830 --> 02:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
everybody free reduced or don't qualify
 
02:20:40.950 --> 02:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
for anything what would the cost be to
 
02:20:44.910 --> 02:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
just feed those that qualify for re free
 
02:20:50.230 --> 02:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
and reduced at the 350 % sure um because
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
we don't currently have a um a measure
 
02:20:58.750 --> 02:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
to get the 186 to the 350 that's why
 
02:21:00.910 --> 02:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
it's undeterminable um because we don't
 
02:21:02.670 --> 02:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
we don't currently have that data at the
 
02:21:05.469 --> 02:21:05.479 align:start position:0%
department um that's another reason why
 
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
the added cost for the three positions
 
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
we would need to um come up with a a pro
 
02:21:14.590 --> 02:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
a process program um to get that so
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
that's unfortunately why it um that cost
 
02:21:18.190 --> 02:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
is indeterminable because we don't have
 
02:21:22.150 --> 02:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
that data okay but follow up the 122
 
02:21:24.990 --> 02:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
could be could be way out of proportion
 
02:21:27.349 --> 02:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
because this is covering everybody even
 
02:21:30.510 --> 02:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
if their annual income is 400,000 that's
 
02:21:32.790 --> 02:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct thank you thank
 
02:21:35.950 --> 02:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
you further questions thank you very
 
02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
much I'm sure you're available too if we
 
02:21:41.790 --> 02:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
have questions absolutely thank you and
 
02:21:44.790 --> 02:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
we have one very late late late card
 
02:21:52.429 --> 02:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:21:56.070 --> 02:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
committee I was going to save this for
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
executive session but it seems important
 
02:22:00.309 --> 02:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
to present it now for the record hope
 
02:22:03.790 --> 02:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
Damon uh suin District 8 and I am a
 
02:22:06.190 --> 02:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
retired dietitian also my mom was a
 
02:22:07.830 --> 02:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
school lunch director back a million
 
02:22:09.950 --> 02:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
years ago and that's how I got into food
 
02:22:13.590 --> 02:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
and nutrition thanks Mom so uh two
 
02:22:15.469 --> 02:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
statistics to answer a question that was
 
02:22:17.389 --> 02:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier and thank you to to
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
chase I'm sorry I don't remember your
 
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
last name um but citing from feeding
 
02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:24.510 align:start position:0%
last name um but citing from feeding
America

02:22:24.510 --> 02:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
America
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
13.3% of children is the child food
 
02:22:29.710 --> 02:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
insecurity rate in New Hampshire in
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
other words 13.3% of kids are
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
experiencing food insecurity and 43% of
 
02:22:38.270 --> 02:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
those children are currently ineligible
 
02:22:41.389 --> 02:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
for the free school lunch
 
02:22:45.190 --> 02:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
program that said we have need I am
 
02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
going to just very efficiently highlight
 
02:22:49.910 --> 02:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
highlight a couple parts of the school
 
02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
lunch program to help counter the
 
02:22:55.469 --> 02:22:55.479 align:start position:0%
impression that it's not nutritious and
 
02:22:58.429 --> 02:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to be aware that what
 
02:23:00.070 --> 02:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
you may have experienced in the school
 
02:23:01.950 --> 02:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
lunch program is not today's school
 
02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
lunch program so we need to make our
 
02:23:06.590 --> 02:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
decisions based on current knowledge
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
practice and
 
02:23:10.750 --> 02:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
standards the quantities of food that
 
02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
are served are different at different
 
02:23:14.550 --> 02:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
grade levels makes sense because kids
 
02:23:16.750 --> 02:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
are different sizes so there's a k to
 
02:23:18.750 --> 02:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
five standard there's a 6 to8 standard
 
02:23:21.429 --> 02:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
and there's a 9 to2 standard and without
 
02:23:25.429 --> 02:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
getting into the weeds there are fruits
 
02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
vegetables in specific categories dark
 
02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
green red orange legumes and separately
 
02:23:33.469 --> 02:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
starchy which is not a very big part of
 
02:23:36.269 --> 02:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
that total of vegetables and additional
 
02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
vegetables as well there is a fluid milk
 
02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
requirement alternative milks are
 
02:23:44.510 --> 02:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
available by request for kids who don't
 
02:23:47.070 --> 02:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
tolerate or don't want Dairy Milk they
 
02:23:50.190 --> 02:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
there are standards for the proteins
 
02:23:53.309 --> 02:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
which could be meat poultry fish eggs
 
02:23:56.110 --> 02:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
cheese non D I'm sorry nonanimal
 
02:23:59.269 --> 02:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
proteins plant proteins and those
 
02:24:03.230 --> 02:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
standards provide less saturated fat and
 
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
less sodium than American families are
 
02:24:08.670 --> 02:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
eating at home there is nothing about
 
02:24:11.269 --> 02:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
the existing school lunch program or
 
02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
breakfast that is less
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
nutritious in fact if you contrast what
 
02:24:19.469 --> 02:24:19.479 align:start position:0%
people send to school it usually fails
 
02:24:20.910 --> 02:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
to meet the standards of the school
 
02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:22.030 align:start position:0%
to meet the standards of the school
lunch

02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
02:24:24.269 --> 02:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
program I would be happy to answer
 
02:24:26.190 --> 02:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
questions or get more information I
 
02:24:30.349 --> 02:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
don't want to uh overtake time thank you
 
02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:32.640 align:start position:0%

peternell thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:24:36.429 --> 02:24:36.439 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question how do you
 
02:24:38.670 --> 02:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
know what food children are eating at
 
02:24:40.269 --> 02:24:40.279 align:start position:0%
home how do you know that they're being
 
02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
fed less saturated fat at school than
 
02:24:44.269 --> 02:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
what they're eating how where do we
 
02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
collect that information from I
 
02:24:47.269 --> 02:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question it's next
 
02:24:53.670 --> 02:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
question there is extensive data on
 
02:24:56.429 --> 02:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
American and also worldwide for that
 
02:24:56.439 --> 02:24:57.990 align:start position:0%
American and also worldwide for that
matter

02:24:57.990 --> 02:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
matter
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
um purchases on waste which is another
 
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
topic to be addressed
 
02:25:07.630 --> 02:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
um I can bring data I can't cite it off
 
02:25:10.429 --> 02:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
the top of my head um but we do know
 
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:18.190 --> 02:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
consuming further questions represent
 
02:25:20.230 --> 02:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
cell thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:25:22.750 --> 02:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I have read
 
02:25:26.670 --> 02:25:26.680 align:start position:0%
recently about how lowfat milk um that
 
02:25:28.469 --> 02:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
that's usually the standard milk that's
 
02:25:31.230 --> 02:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
served in school lunches the low
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
fat you know on the chart that I'm
 
02:25:36.710 --> 02:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
looking at it doesn't
 
02:25:39.150 --> 02:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
specify so I would want to get back to
 
02:25:43.070 --> 02:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
you about that if memory serves me it's
 
02:25:45.630 --> 02:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
2% I'm not certain of that though okay
 
02:25:46.990 --> 02:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
so that wasn't my main question Iain
 
02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
question is that there are studies
 
02:25:50.230 --> 02:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
showing that whole milk is more
 
02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
nutritious is that an option to receive
 
02:25:53.630 --> 02:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
this may be something you'd have to fill
 
02:25:55.750 --> 02:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
me in on but I just wanted to bring this
 
02:25:56.990 --> 02:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
issue up because it's something I've
 
02:25:59.269 --> 02:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
been reading about about how the low fat
 
02:26:02.030 --> 02:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
or the 2% is not as good nutritionally
 
02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
for students so I want to know more
 
02:26:06.910 --> 02:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
about what are the options I appreciate
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
the question it is a topic of great
 
02:26:10.710 --> 02:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
controversy in the field of
 
02:26:14.510 --> 02:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
nutrition um there are literally decades
 
02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
going back to the
 
02:26:20.030 --> 02:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
1950s of research data that lower fat
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
dairy products are strongly associated
 
02:26:24.710 --> 02:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
with less cardiovascular disease and
 
02:26:26.230 --> 02:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
less cancer
 
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
incidents there is definitely a
 
02:26:30.830 --> 02:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
population of people including some
 
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
credible nutritionists and researchers
 
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
who disagree with that I think the
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
jury's still out to be frank um and I
 
02:26:39.990 --> 02:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
will get back to you on whether there is
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
an option in the school meal programs to
 
02:26:44.910 --> 02:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
choose which one I don't
 
02:26:47.429 --> 02:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
know thank thank you very much Diaz
 
02:26:48.710 --> 02:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of news on that
 
02:26:50.309 --> 02:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
recently regarding chocolate milk and
 
02:26:53.630 --> 02:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
white milk and and various doctors
 
02:26:55.750 --> 02:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the child are now starting to
 
02:26:59.830 --> 02:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
say the whole milk is more appropriate
 
02:27:01.349 --> 02:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
for that particular child but it's
 
02:27:04.110 --> 02:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
individuals so I think it partly does
 
02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
depend on the individual child and I
 
02:27:07.870 --> 02:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
actually can't resist the opportunity to
 
02:27:09.429 --> 02:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
say chocolate milk is better than no
 
02:27:12.670 --> 02:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
milk and it is very full of
 
02:27:15.150 --> 02:27:15.160 align:start position:0%
sugar represent
 
02:27:17.190 --> 02:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:27:20.870 --> 02:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
rep D for the support on this one
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
um I would be perfectly happy to operate
 
02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
on the assumption that the guidelines
 
02:27:29.150 --> 02:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
prescribed for
 
02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
nutrition uh that we actually deliver
 
02:27:33.510 --> 02:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire are according to
 
02:27:37.150 --> 02:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
the USDA nutritional guide um however I
 
02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
don't think that is the only measure of
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
quality and I would ask if you would
 
02:27:45.790 --> 02:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
agree that if a student or any students
 
02:27:48.070 --> 02:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
on average were were were wasting and
 
02:27:51.870 --> 02:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
throwing away 30% or 25% of their meal
 
02:27:55.030 --> 02:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
might they despite the nutritional
 
02:27:58.389 --> 02:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
um being there accessible to them might
 
02:28:00.670 --> 02:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
they be actually nutritionally deficient
 
02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
because they just don't like a portion
 
02:28:03.790 --> 02:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:28:07.269 --> 02:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
meal thank you for the
 
02:28:09.590 --> 02:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
question I believe on the high school
 
02:28:13.269 --> 02:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
level the school lunch program includes
 
02:28:15.070 --> 02:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
an option for districts to choose what's
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
called offer versus serve
 
02:28:18.830 --> 02:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
which means that they have to offer all
 
02:28:22.030 --> 02:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
the components of the requisite meal
 
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
plan to every student but the student
 
02:28:26.710 --> 02:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
decides what they take it greatly
 
02:28:28.950 --> 02:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
reduces waste I mean if you absolutely
 
02:28:30.070 --> 02:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
know you're not going to eat the green
 
02:28:31.510 --> 02:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
beans there isn't really any point in
 
02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
giving them to you there is also a
 
02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
concerted effort to collaborate with the
 
02:28:42.349 --> 02:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
students to create meals that are
 
02:28:45.870 --> 02:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
nutritious and that they enjoy eating um
 
02:28:48.309 --> 02:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
and there have been some programs also
 
02:28:50.790 --> 02:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
where the kids tracked food waste and
 
02:28:52.429 --> 02:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
reported on it to their peers that have
 
02:28:54.750 --> 02:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
been really effective at decreasing
 
02:28:57.910 --> 02:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
waste and helping kids consume what is
 
02:29:01.309 --> 02:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
good for them there's no perfect system
 
02:29:05.630 --> 02:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
um but I think funding this program is
 
02:29:07.389 --> 02:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
very important to the well-being of New
 
02:29:09.870 --> 02:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire kids thank you further
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
02:29:14.030 --> 02:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
02:29:16.670 --> 02:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
much and with that we're going to close
 
02:29:19.510 --> 02:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
down uh this this bill 1212 and we're
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
going to move into the last bill before
 
02:29:23.790 --> 02:29:23.800 align:start position:0%

02:30:05.550 --> 02:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
26 today I introduce House Bill 1516 an
 
02:30:08.070 --> 02:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
act relative to enrollment in public
 
02:30:11.630 --> 02:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
schools by children of School District
 
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
employees this bill is intended to give
 
02:30:15.630 --> 02:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
school districts another possible
 
02:30:19.349 --> 02:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
incentive to Aid in uh recruiting and

retaining of teachers and staff by
 
02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
allowing the an employee to take play uh
 
02:30:27.670 --> 02:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
to place their child in the district
 
02:30:30.190 --> 02:30:30.200 align:start position:0%
where they are employed when not a
 
02:30:31.630 --> 02:30:31.640 align:start position:0%

02:30:36.070 --> 02:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
offer this to their employees in one
 
02:30:39.309 --> 02:30:39.319 align:start position:0%
form or another as a policy and find it
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
as being utilized this bill would take
 
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
it from policy to statute as enabling
 
02:30:47.110 --> 02:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
legislation emplo employees who take
 
02:30:48.750 --> 02:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
advantage of this will have the same
 
02:30:51.309 --> 02:30:51.319 align:start position:0%
school schedule as their children and
 
02:30:53.389 --> 02:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
will decrease the Scramble for child
 
02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:55.680 align:start position:0%

02:31:43.429 --> 02:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
questions from the

Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:31:52.070 --> 02:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm wondering what
 
02:31:54.389 --> 02:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
portion of New Hampshire public schools
 
02:31:57.750 --> 02:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
are open enrollment or are
 
02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
not I do not have the answer to that I
 
02:32:05.150 --> 02:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh I've heard that
 
02:32:07.790 --> 02:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
it's you know some number but I I would
 
02:32:10.910 --> 02:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:14.190 --> 02:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
guessing further question represent Bon
 
02:32:15.469 --> 02:32:15.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:32:16.830 --> 02:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:32:19.590 --> 02:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
um um where I was on Schoolboard member
 
02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
and Ry we had a policy where we did
 
02:32:24.309 --> 02:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
allow staff members to um enroll their
 
02:32:26.590 --> 02:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
children um but the problem always comes
 
02:32:29.550 --> 02:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
into with the special education services
 
02:32:30.870 --> 02:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
because you don't know that if you take
 
02:32:33.150 --> 02:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
an child at kindergarten and those costs
 
02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
can be substantial if you take it in it
 
02:32:38.670 --> 02:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
do this bill address any of those
 
02:32:41.110 --> 02:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
implications um regarding special
 
02:32:44.110 --> 02:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
education uh no the bill doesn't address
 
02:32:47.870 --> 02:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
special education but the District in
 
02:32:49.990 --> 02:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
considering whether to offer this as an
 
02:32:54.990 --> 02:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:57.190 --> 02:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
that further
 
02:32:59.590 --> 02:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
questions I I'll ask you one sening you
 
02:33:01.710 --> 02:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the bill uh we had
 
02:33:04.710 --> 02:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
this policy in hail at one point in
 
02:33:08.590 --> 02:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
time and then we had people that were
 
02:33:12.110 --> 02:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
Bankers or professional people or just
 
02:33:13.950 --> 02:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
people that were also working in the
 
02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
town that the teacher was going to with
 
02:33:19.309 --> 02:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
his or her
 
02:33:22.710 --> 02:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
child and we had folks saying that's
 
02:33:25.230 --> 02:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
discrimination you're offering it to the
 
02:33:29.150 --> 02:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
teacher but you're not offering it to
 
02:33:31.910 --> 02:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
this family over here how do we deal
 
02:33:33.550 --> 02:33:33.560 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
situation well as as far as being
 
02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
discriminatory it it's really a matter
 
02:33:42.389 --> 02:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
of um trying to
 
02:33:47.190 --> 02:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
employe um teachers and staff
 
02:33:50.110 --> 02:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
and if that is something that helps them
 
02:33:52.510 --> 02:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
get enough teachers to operate their
 
02:33:55.710 --> 02:33:55.720 align:start position:0%
school then that's not really
 
02:33:59.190 --> 02:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
discriminatory uh whereas the Open
 
02:34:01.830 --> 02:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
Enrollment program if it was fully
 
02:34:03.510 --> 02:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
implemented the school would be able to
 
02:34:05.230 --> 02:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
take any other students if there was
 
02:34:08.030 --> 02:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:12.750 --> 02:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
classes other questions thank you very
 
02:34:15.429 --> 02:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
much I didn't see any other questions
 
02:34:17.670 --> 02:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
from the committee refan is your hand up
 
02:34:19.910 --> 02:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
or not um does the school have the
 
02:34:24.710 --> 02:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
option of uh not allowing extra students
 
02:34:28.030 --> 02:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
if they didn't have room uh this in in
 
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
the open school um uh enrollment the
 
02:34:34.030 --> 02:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
Open Enrollment school program it's up
 
02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
to the schools if they have room they do
 
02:34:39.550 --> 02:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
not have to hire additional uh teachers
 
02:34:42.510 --> 02:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
or provide additional classrooms uh to
 
02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:45.070 align:start position:0%
or provide additional classrooms uh to
accommodate

02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
accommodate
 
02:34:48.469 --> 02:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
this any further questions thank you
 
02:35:02.830 --> 02:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:04.710 --> 02:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
dry thank
 
02:35:07.910 --> 02:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you all for listening um for
 
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
the record I Margaret J representative
 
02:35:14.429 --> 02:35:14.439 align:start position:0%
of planfield Cornish Newport unity in
 
02:35:17.670 --> 02:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
Charlestown and it's Sullivan district 7
 
02:35:20.110 --> 02:35:20.120 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor of this
 
02:35:23.630 --> 02:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
bill and HP 1516 if you look out the
 
02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
window is uh today is a perfect example
 
02:35:30.790 --> 02:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
of why this bill would be a help to some
 
02:35:34.110 --> 02:35:34.120 align:start position:0%
families if you watched the number of
 
02:35:37.590 --> 02:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
schools closings and delays go up on
 
02:35:40.550 --> 02:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
WMUR like I did and if you examined the
 
02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
406 that were there this morning you
 
02:35:46.030 --> 02:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
will see that the schools all over the
 
02:35:48.150 --> 02:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
the map are all over the map right
 
02:35:51.349 --> 02:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
there's 3-hour early dismissal there's
 
02:35:54.110 --> 02:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
195 minutes early dismissal there's
 
02:35:57.710 --> 02:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
closed all day there's a remote all day
 
02:36:02.550 --> 02:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
and unity 2hour delay go figure um right
 
02:36:05.870 --> 02:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
so these are towns that are contiguous
 
02:36:07.710 --> 02:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
so and I just want you to remember that
 
02:36:09.870 --> 02:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
not all staff and teachers live in the
 
02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
town where they work and if the towns
 
02:36:14.110 --> 02:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
are contiguous there's a possibility
 
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
that their families are on a totally
 
02:36:18.990 --> 02:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
different schedule today than they
 
02:36:23.190 --> 02:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
are now I know this opens up a lot of of
 
02:36:25.150 --> 02:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
people to this opportunity that haven't
 
02:36:26.590 --> 02:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
had it before but remember that not
 
02:36:27.950 --> 02:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to take advantage of
 
02:36:29.790 --> 02:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
it there are a lot of reasons that
 
02:36:31.309 --> 02:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
children would want to stay in the
 
02:36:32.990 --> 02:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
school that they're in their friends the
 
02:36:35.670 --> 02:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
location close to home uh Athletics all
 
02:36:37.309 --> 02:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
those kind of things so don't think of
 
02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
this as a universal bill but think of it
 
02:36:40.910 --> 02:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
as enabling
 
02:36:44.110 --> 02:36:44.120 align:start position:0%
legislation uh it enables people to have
 
02:36:46.269 --> 02:36:46.279 align:start position:0%
an opportunity that some are are already
 
02:36:49.469 --> 02:36:49.479 align:start position:0%
enjoying I understand that the conal um
 
02:36:53.309 --> 02:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
District uh it's well utilized there um
 
02:36:54.910 --> 02:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
and what we want to do is extend this
 
02:36:57.910 --> 02:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to other staff and teachers
 
02:37:00.110 --> 02:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
that people in the state are already
 
02:37:02.590 --> 02:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
enjoying and just to follow up on my
 
02:37:04.670 --> 02:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
fellow representative there um special
 
02:37:09.269 --> 02:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
ed is already covered in the um 194
 
02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
D5 and Roman numeral 2 on page 36 639 of
 
02:37:16.429 --> 02:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
our new book
 
02:37:20.950 --> 02:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
and um additional students uh in the
 
02:37:23.349 --> 02:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
bill itself here the new paragraph that
 
02:37:27.230 --> 02:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
we are adding says that um they can
 
02:37:28.550 --> 02:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
enroll their children in the school
 
02:37:29.830 --> 02:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
district in which they're employed
 
02:37:32.590 --> 02:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
provided there is adequate space and no
 
02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
additional staff or classrooms need that
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
need to be added and that would be at
 
02:37:40.670 --> 02:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the receiving
 
02:37:43.550 --> 02:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
school and I'm asking for your support
 
02:37:44.710 --> 02:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
02:37:46.870 --> 02:37:46.880 align:start position:0%

thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:37:50.910 --> 02:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
question some schools are already doing
 
02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
this correct and this is enabling
 
02:37:56.910 --> 02:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
legislation that allows schools to do
 
02:37:58.750 --> 02:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
that which they're already allowed to do
 
02:38:01.110 --> 02:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
it because they're doing it why do we
 
02:38:03.950 --> 02:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
need this bill uh this is includes staff
 
02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
as well as teachers uh most of the
 
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
policies are
 
02:38:10.870 --> 02:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
teachers staff as well as
 
02:38:13.230 --> 02:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
seers further
 
02:38:15.309 --> 02:38:15.319 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing it thank you very
 
02:38:15.319 --> 02:38:17.309 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing it thank you very
much

02:38:17.309 --> 02:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:38:19.110 --> 02:38:19.120 align:start position:0%

02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:23.750 align:start position:0%
Department is that to testify or just as
technical

02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
technical
 
02:38:27.230 --> 02:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
support are there any questions for the
 
02:38:29.150 --> 02:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
Department on
 
02:38:32.349 --> 02:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
this from Rebecca
 
02:38:35.230 --> 02:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
ver well fine why don't you come answer
 
02:38:43.910 --> 02:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:46.429 --> 02:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
you good morning my name is Rebeca fedad
 
02:38:48.870 --> 02:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
I'm the um administrator for the Bureau
 
02:38:50.429 --> 02:38:50.439 align:start position:0%
of special education at the Department
 
02:38:52.830 --> 02:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
of Education there are some impacts to
 
02:38:54.750 --> 02:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
special education with this bill um
 
02:38:57.269 --> 02:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
currently in law the resident District
 
02:38:58.870 --> 02:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
of the student is still responsible for
 
02:39:00.750 --> 02:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
special education so even if a child
 
02:39:03.030 --> 02:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
does go to another um open enrollment
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
School the resident district is still
 
02:39:06.830 --> 02:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for all special education
 
02:39:08.550 --> 02:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
costs um that would include
 
02:39:10.190 --> 02:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
Transportation if they're providing
 
02:39:13.030 --> 02:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation within the individual IEP
 
02:39:15.190 --> 02:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
in in the IEP then they would need to
 
02:39:17.230 --> 02:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
continue to provide that transportation
 
02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
to the child because it's part of their
 
02:39:23.910 --> 02:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
IEP um the other piece was that although
 
02:39:26.670 --> 02:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
the funding may be the the tuition may
 
02:39:30.389 --> 02:39:30.399 align:start position:0%
be paid by the parent as I said all
 
02:39:32.830 --> 02:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
other sources of funding for special
 
02:39:34.269 --> 02:39:34.279 align:start position:0%
education come from that Resident
 
02:39:36.830 --> 02:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
District so that just needs to be taken
 
02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
into consideration as students parents
 
02:39:42.349 --> 02:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
may take advantage of that so I have a
 
02:39:45.269 --> 02:39:45.279 align:start position:0%
follow up on that and that so you have a
 
02:39:48.670 --> 02:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
child that's multiple handicapped with
 
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
some handicaps which are very very
 
02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
expensive who pays for the burden of
 
02:39:57.550 --> 02:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
equipment and supplies and Staffing in
 
02:40:00.309 --> 02:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
the receiving School the the school that
 
02:40:02.750 --> 02:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
the parent is working in and bringing
 
02:40:05.110 --> 02:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
her or his child to the resident
 
02:40:07.469 --> 02:40:07.479 align:start position:0%
District the resident district has all
 
02:40:09.349 --> 02:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
costs including
 
02:40:12.389 --> 02:40:12.399 align:start position:0%
equipment Etc
 
02:40:14.750 --> 02:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
y because it's they have the pro they
 
02:40:17.070 --> 02:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
are still um according to our state law
 
02:40:18.910 --> 02:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
and then for our funding formula that we
 
02:40:20.870 --> 02:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
had approved through the federal office
 
02:40:23.990 --> 02:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
of special education programs or oep um
 
02:40:25.510 --> 02:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
the resident District remains
 
02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for the provision of fape
 
02:40:28.750 --> 02:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
which in turn means that they are
 
02:40:31.309 --> 02:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for all financial pieces to
 
02:40:33.190 --> 02:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
that provision of fape so on the
 
02:40:35.590 --> 02:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
followup in terms of the facility that
 
02:40:38.389 --> 02:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
the receiving school has if it's a
 
02:40:40.389 --> 02:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
physical therapy or something such as
 
02:40:42.830 --> 02:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
that where you're going to have you know
 
02:40:44.670 --> 02:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of equipment in that building to
 
02:40:46.429 --> 02:40:46.439 align:start position:0%
deal with this student that probably
 
02:40:49.670 --> 02:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't move mats Etc that is the
 
02:40:51.469 --> 02:40:51.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the sending District
 
02:40:53.190 --> 02:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
to modify that building and the
 
02:40:55.550 --> 02:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
receiving District um modifying the
 
02:40:58.190 --> 02:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
building would be um extremely difficult
 
02:41:00.030 --> 02:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
to do but it would be something that the
 
02:41:01.910 --> 02:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
sending and receiving District need to
 
02:41:04.590 --> 02:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
work through many of them have the
 
02:41:06.150 --> 02:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
equipment that you're speaking of mats
 
02:41:07.429 --> 02:41:07.439 align:start position:0%
and things like that for physical
 
02:41:09.269 --> 02:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
therapy but anything that is above and
 
02:41:12.349 --> 02:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
beyond what that receiving district has
 
02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
and the child needs would be the
 
02:41:17.110 --> 02:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the resident District
 
02:41:20.870 --> 02:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Miler thank you Mr
 
02:41:22.670 --> 02:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:41:24.590 --> 02:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
question I'm not sure you can answer
 
02:41:26.510 --> 02:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
this question but it's it's in my mind
 
02:41:32.190 --> 02:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
right now if a um student is to follow
 
02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
the parent to that school
 
02:41:38.950 --> 02:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
district a is there a tuition cost or
 
02:41:42.190 --> 02:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
does that students just become part of
 
02:41:47.950 --> 02:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
the uh adma uh of that District I'm I do
 
02:41:50.389 --> 02:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
not know that answer to that question um
 
02:41:54.190 --> 02:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
I believe that the um yeah I don't know
 
02:41:55.550 --> 02:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
the answer I don't want I don't want to
 
02:41:57.790 --> 02:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
speak to that we'll need to get that
 
02:42:00.590 --> 02:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
answer but thank you representative
 
02:42:02.670 --> 02:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
Cornell Thank you thank you for taking
 
02:42:04.710 --> 02:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
my question when you said a special ed
 
02:42:07.510 --> 02:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
student cost and you you did mention
 
02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation so there even though this
 
02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
says the parent is responsible for
 
02:42:13.910 --> 02:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
transportation if it's a special ed
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
student the resident District would
 
02:42:18.469 --> 02:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
still be responsible for transporting
 
02:42:20.469 --> 02:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
that student to the new school if it's
 
02:42:22.710 --> 02:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
in the iup because many times the reason
 
02:42:24.110 --> 02:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
it's in the iupp is that they need
 
02:42:25.870 --> 02:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
specialized Transportation so they may
 
02:42:27.510 --> 02:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
need a wheelchair lift or they may need
 
02:42:28.870 --> 02:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
something like that so if the student
 
02:42:30.469 --> 02:42:30.479 align:start position:0%
goes to another District they still have
 
02:42:32.469 --> 02:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
to be responsible for that specialized
 
02:42:35.110 --> 02:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
Transportation okay followup yes and
 
02:42:36.750 --> 02:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
that could be quite a distance then that
 
02:42:39.230 --> 02:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
could deping someone that lives in
 
02:42:42.349 --> 02:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
Manchester whose parent Works um in
 
02:42:44.550 --> 02:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
Berlin yeah unless the parent transports
 
02:42:46.110 --> 02:42:46.120 align:start position:0%
the child and then they but if it is
 
02:42:47.630 --> 02:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
specialized transportation that that
 
02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
child needs yes okay thank
 
02:42:53.670 --> 02:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
you wow further
 
02:42:57.110 --> 02:42:57.120 align:start position:0%

first sheet is one which I'm going to go
 
03:48:02.309 --> 03:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
through and try to explain some of the
 
03:48:05.030 --> 03:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
what's happened within this bill and the
 
03:48:07.950 --> 03:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
second is a a letter of memorandum that
 
03:48:09.950 --> 03:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
went is it was a
 
03:48:11.790 --> 03:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
a summary of what we did in the preing
 
03:48:12.710 --> 03:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
year with the public school
 
03:48:15.349 --> 03:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure commission so starting
 
03:48:19.469 --> 03:48:19.479 align:start position:0%
out this bill is um a bill that cleans
 
03:48:21.950 --> 03:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
up a lot of language presented to us by
 
03:48:25.950 --> 03:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
the department and and uh the Amy Clark
 
03:48:27.790 --> 03:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
from the department will be here to
 
03:48:29.950 --> 03:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
follow up to discuss some of the
 
03:48:32.389 --> 03:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
technical aspects of the bill what what
 
03:48:34.070 --> 03:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
the bill does do is you walk down
 
03:48:37.030 --> 03:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
through IT addresses a number of areas
 
03:48:38.870 --> 03:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
within everything from school building a
 
03:48:41.229 --> 03:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
grants to to amounts of Grants to the
 
03:48:43.590 --> 03:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
plan of plan approval for the specs and
 
03:48:46.110 --> 03:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
the costing the purchase a whole lot of
 
03:48:47.710 --> 03:48:47.720 align:start position:0%
issues which you can read there that I
 
03:48:49.990 --> 03:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
put down but then it directs the State
 
03:48:52.670 --> 03:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
Board to adopt rules relative to the
 
03:48:55.110 --> 03:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
maximum usable size for land purchases
 
03:48:57.189 --> 03:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
that's all in the handout so the clerk
 
03:48:59.870 --> 03:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to write every word down um
 
03:49:01.550 --> 03:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
take into account the type and size of
 
03:49:03.349 --> 03:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
the school and based upon minimum size
 
03:49:06.309 --> 03:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
appropriation for that job a lot of
 
03:49:09.429 --> 03:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
school districts will submit uh uh plans
 
03:49:13.990 --> 03:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
and it far exceeds um what is uh above
 
03:49:16.349 --> 03:49:16.359 align:start position:0%
the minimum standard for that particular
 
03:49:20.309 --> 03:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
size or or or space and the district or
 
03:49:22.110 --> 03:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
the state will only fund what is the
 
03:49:24.670 --> 03:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
minimum standard they have to pay the
 
03:49:27.149 --> 03:49:27.159 align:start position:0%
difference all School billing Aid grants
 
03:49:29.790 --> 03:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
shall be deposited by the department
 
03:49:31.269 --> 03:49:31.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Education into an
 
03:49:32.830 --> 03:49:32.840 align:start position:0%
established School District spendable
 
03:49:35.590 --> 03:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
account this is so we're not going to be
 
03:49:39.349 --> 03:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
U looking at monies in that uh uh
 
03:49:41.429 --> 03:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
account which are being co-mingled with
 
03:49:43.630 --> 03:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
other dollars from that particular town
 
03:49:45.110 --> 03:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
or other grants we're trying to keep
 
03:49:47.590 --> 03:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
this money if this money is appropriated
 
03:49:49.630 --> 03:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
and it's used for that specific purpose
 
03:49:52.429 --> 03:49:52.439 align:start position:0%
or upgrading that facility that's fine
 
03:49:54.630 --> 03:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
but when you start co-mingling it or
 
03:49:56.510 --> 03:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
using it for other monies that's not
 
03:49:58.950 --> 03:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
allowable there's been question in there
 
03:50:01.030 --> 03:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
too regarding the the language of
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
project manager versus owner
 
03:50:04.910 --> 03:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh I think you're going
 
03:50:07.189 --> 03:50:07.199 align:start position:0%
to hear a pretty good clear definition
 
03:50:09.469 --> 03:50:09.479 align:start position:0%
why that change has been made I can't
 
03:50:12.269 --> 03:50:12.279 align:start position:0%
recall the last time we modified the
 
03:50:15.830 --> 03:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
school building Aid section here the um
 
03:50:18.510 --> 03:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
person overseeing a renovation or
 
03:50:20.870 --> 03:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
construction of a of a project using
 
03:50:23.070 --> 03:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
monies from the state whether it's that
 
03:50:27.510 --> 03:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
30 to 60% amount was often times
 
03:50:30.910 --> 03:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
somebody had not a hot clue about
 
03:50:34.950 --> 03:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
construction and and uh standards and
 
03:50:36.990 --> 03:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
Engineering associated with that job it
 
03:50:39.349 --> 03:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
might have been the custodian or it
 
03:50:41.030 --> 03:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
might have been a maintenance man hired
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
to or gal who was hired to do the
 
03:50:45.070 --> 03:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance work but didn't have the
 
03:50:48.149 --> 03:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
expertise to oversee the construction or
 
03:50:50.309 --> 03:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
renovation of a huge project could
 
03:50:52.429 --> 03:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
anywhere from anywhere from $2 $3
 
03:50:56.790 --> 03:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
million up to as much as over $9 million
 
03:50:58.750 --> 03:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
and I had that experience when
 
03:51:02.550 --> 03:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
we on a job I had had to hire a clerk of
 
03:51:05.269 --> 03:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
the works who had an engineering
 
03:51:08.269 --> 03:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
background and that was a that that
 
03:51:10.790 --> 03:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
person was hired by by the school
 
03:51:14.309 --> 03:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
district or the owner in some cases
 
03:51:16.149 --> 03:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
where I was in one project up in the
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
other state I was in the overseer or the
 
03:51:22.910 --> 03:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
the clerk of the works was hired by the
 
03:51:24.910 --> 03:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
contractor and every time there's a
 
03:51:27.710 --> 03:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
change order coming down it was approved
 
03:51:30.790 --> 03:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
and it went well beyond standards Etc so
 
03:51:32.950 --> 03:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
we tried to clarify that and I think you
 
03:51:36.349 --> 03:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
will also find from the people to follow
 
03:51:38.750 --> 03:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
we want people in that job that capacity
 
03:51:43.870 --> 03:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
who are qualified to do the job um going
 
03:51:46.469 --> 03:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
on down further uh Public School
 
03:51:48.349 --> 03:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund I want to talk a
 
03:51:50.910 --> 03:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
moment about that seeing that I have
 
03:51:53.590 --> 03:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
been chairing that commission since its
 
03:51:55.710 --> 03:51:55.720 align:start position:0%
start back in
 
03:51:58.429 --> 03:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
2018 uh when we wrote all those
 
03:52:00.349 --> 03:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations in a task force for
 
03:52:03.309 --> 03:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
safety within our state that was back
 
03:52:06.830 --> 03:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
when uh commissioner uh director um
 
03:52:10.950 --> 03:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
Perry PL uh Perry um
 
03:52:14.070 --> 03:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
plumber yeah from Homeland Security was
 
03:52:16.149 --> 03:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
there and since then we have gone
 
03:52:17.910 --> 03:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
through and there's an attached uh
 
03:52:20.070 --> 03:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
document there where we've allocated
 
03:52:24.070 --> 03:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
allocated over $50 million for upgrading
 
03:52:26.189 --> 03:52:26.199 align:start position:0%
uh the facilities and through different
 
03:52:28.110 --> 03:52:28.120 align:start position:0%
phases one two and three which we're in
 
03:52:29.950 --> 03:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:52:33.910 --> 03:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
and uh the the change there there's
 
03:52:36.269 --> 03:52:36.279 align:start position:0%
several changes there's reports due and
 
03:52:38.830 --> 03:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
on a certain date and I I believe if you
 
03:52:40.750 --> 03:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh Le to the other side you can see
 
03:52:43.630 --> 03:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
there's an annual report due on the 30th
 
03:52:45.790 --> 03:52:45.800 align:start position:0%
of each year of how those monies are
 
03:52:47.710 --> 03:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
being used and what's transpired in that
 
03:52:49.910 --> 03:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
previous year one of the things that we
 
03:52:51.950 --> 03:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
have to be very very careful on on a
 
03:52:54.389 --> 03:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure project is
 
03:52:54.399 --> 03:52:55.149 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure project is
the

03:52:55.149 --> 03:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:52:56.870 --> 03:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
confidentiality de dealing with
 
03:52:59.990 --> 03:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
surveillance security access type issues
 
03:53:02.110 --> 03:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
which uh we don't want to make public
 
03:53:05.110 --> 03:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
seeing that where we may have issues or
 
03:53:07.830 --> 03:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
concerns uh that is for that particular
 
03:53:10.790 --> 03:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
commission and the issues is made up of
 
03:53:14.429 --> 03:53:14.439 align:start position:0%
people from doe and Homeland Security
 
03:53:16.269 --> 03:53:16.279 align:start position:0%
and and then there's some representation
 
03:53:17.950 --> 03:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
from the house and the Senate on that as
 
03:53:20.269 --> 03:53:20.279 align:start position:0%
well uh it's a commission that's
 
03:53:23.030 --> 03:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
functioned uh well since it started I
 
03:53:25.189 --> 03:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
will also say that one of the things
 
03:53:26.990 --> 03:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
that to change and and this is trying to
 
03:53:29.550 --> 03:53:29.560 align:start position:0%
do is that when we make this money is
 
03:53:33.870 --> 03:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
appropriated by uh the uh general court
 
03:53:35.510 --> 03:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
and it's usually in
 
03:53:39.030 --> 03:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
hb2 um when that money and there has
 
03:53:40.269 --> 03:53:40.279 align:start position:0%
been some money that we spent which has
 
03:53:42.750 --> 03:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
come from gopher money uh money that's
 
03:53:44.630 --> 03:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
more Federal oriented and that so we
 
03:53:46.110 --> 03:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
have two separate accounts there and we
 
03:53:48.189 --> 03:53:48.199 align:start position:0%
have to be careful how we spend because
 
03:53:50.830 --> 03:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
there's different responsibilities for
 
03:53:52.950 --> 03:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh getting approval to spend those money
 
03:53:55.229 --> 03:53:55.239 align:start position:0%
any money appropriated in the past has
 
03:53:57.550 --> 03:53:57.560 align:start position:0%
had to go to the recommendation comes
 
03:54:00.189 --> 03:54:00.199 align:start position:0%
from the commission then it goes to
 
03:54:04.110 --> 03:54:04.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and then it goes on to
 
03:54:07.630 --> 03:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
Executive counsel for approval that has
 
03:54:11.229 --> 03:54:11.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes been a long wait and and
 
03:54:13.070 --> 03:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
several you could create at least a
 
03:54:15.710 --> 03:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
month month and a half of time to get
 
03:54:17.309 --> 03:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
all that through those bureaucratic
 
03:54:19.269 --> 03:54:19.279 align:start position:0%
Hoops when the money's already been
 
03:54:21.149 --> 03:54:21.159 align:start position:0%
appropriated by the general court for
 
03:54:24.429 --> 03:54:24.439 align:start position:0%
this purpose and so we've had times when
 
03:54:26.790 --> 03:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to get the money to
 
03:54:28.830 --> 03:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
where it needs to be placed projects
 
03:54:31.269 --> 03:54:31.279 align:start position:0%
can't start and they're delayed and we
 
03:54:34.030 --> 03:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes miss the best building season
 
03:54:36.070 --> 03:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
or the time when we can try and get a
 
03:54:38.349 --> 03:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
hold of a contractor we've had a number
 
03:54:40.630 --> 03:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
of issues where project monies have gone
 
03:54:42.189 --> 03:54:42.199 align:start position:0%
to Southern the southern part of the
 
03:54:44.830 --> 03:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
state and I'll just throw some examples
 
03:54:47.189 --> 03:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
right now hypothetical ones we might
 
03:54:48.750 --> 03:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
have been able to get a job done for
 
03:54:50.950 --> 03:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
$500,000 by the time the money arrives
 
03:54:53.149 --> 03:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
the price has already gone up to
 
03:54:56.070 --> 03:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
$750,000 so we need to be timely in the
 
03:54:57.710 --> 03:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
process where we're trying to eliminate
 
03:55:00.630 --> 03:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
those Hoops of fiscal and executive
 
03:55:02.149 --> 03:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
councel where it's already been
 
03:55:04.349 --> 03:55:04.359 align:start position:0%
appropriated for use to the department
 
03:55:07.309 --> 03:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
for use for these projects so we don't
 
03:55:09.550 --> 03:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
have to have another set of
 
03:55:11.750 --> 03:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
approvals for the use of these monies
 
03:55:15.030 --> 03:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's already been done by the general
 
03:55:17.990 --> 03:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
court so I think I got through most of
 
03:55:19.630 --> 03:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
the changes there other than the last
 
03:55:20.830 --> 03:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
one when we talked about the
 
03:55:23.950 --> 03:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
investigation of air quality um air
 
03:55:27.950 --> 03:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
quality is uh uh real important that we
 
03:55:32.269 --> 03:55:32.279 align:start position:0%
um have an annual report submitted and
 
03:55:34.990 --> 03:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
it's done by the the the principal
 
03:55:36.830 --> 03:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
within the building and they have to
 
03:55:39.429 --> 03:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
conduct an investigation to you know
 
03:55:41.309 --> 03:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
look at what kind of air quality we do
 
03:55:43.070 --> 03:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
we have in this particular building I've
 
03:55:44.630 --> 03:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
been in buildings where the air quality
 
03:55:46.750 --> 03:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
often times will come through this old
 
03:55:49.110 --> 03:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
intakes uh along the wall they rattle
 
03:55:51.269 --> 03:55:51.279 align:start position:0%
they Shake kids come in from Recess put
 
03:55:52.910 --> 03:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
their dirty mittens on top of it and
 
03:55:54.510 --> 03:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
that's all you smell for the rest of the
 
03:55:57.950 --> 03:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
day or there was one school I went to
 
03:56:00.229 --> 03:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
not too far from here I won't name it
 
03:56:02.269 --> 03:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
but when we went on a visit years ago
 
03:56:03.870 --> 03:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
all we could smell is everything being
 
03:56:06.870 --> 03:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
cooked in the kitchen and it just oozed
 
03:56:08.750 --> 03:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
through the whole building so it's
 
03:56:10.710 --> 03:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
important that we have this survey done
 
03:56:12.550 --> 03:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
this investigation and that has to be a
 
03:56:15.149 --> 03:56:15.159 align:start position:0%
report every 5 years um that's a good
 
03:56:16.990 --> 03:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
move we used to give an additional Mone
 
03:56:19.070 --> 03:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
to schools that went into these energy
 
03:56:20.870 --> 03:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
efficient type projects that's we're
 
03:56:22.469 --> 03:56:22.479 align:start position:0%
don't do that
 
03:56:27.229 --> 03:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
now so and you used to be uh doe shall
 
03:56:30.110 --> 03:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh ensure now it's encouraged because
 
03:56:31.670 --> 03:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
there's really not that hammer we're
 
03:56:33.510 --> 03:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
encouraging these districts to complete
 
03:56:35.910 --> 03:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
and follow through on this process so I
 
03:56:37.670 --> 03:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
won't talk anymore about the bill it is
 
03:56:39.429 --> 03:56:39.439 align:start position:0%
a bill that's been submitted To Us by a
 
03:56:42.510 --> 03:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
department um in my perspective it's one
 
03:56:44.070 --> 03:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
that has a lot of points in here which
 
03:56:47.229 --> 03:56:47.239 align:start position:0%
will expedite and improve language and
 
03:56:48.990 --> 03:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
and better assist what we're doing in
 
03:56:51.110 --> 03:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
these schools in terms of renovation and
 
03:56:53.229 --> 03:56:53.239 align:start position:0%
construction and surveying what we
 
03:56:55.269 --> 03:56:55.279 align:start position:0%
presently have I'll be glad to take any
 
03:56:57.750 --> 03:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
questions but uh the Department's here
 
03:56:59.870 --> 03:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
to ask the technical stuff and answer
 
03:57:00.990 --> 03:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
you on that
 
03:57:05.710 --> 03:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
stuff if you so need that represent
 
03:57:08.830 --> 03:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you um yeah I was in
 
03:57:11.630 --> 03:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
involved with the unity school that went
 
03:57:14.189 --> 03:57:14.199 align:start position:0%
on forever and one of the things was the
 
03:57:15.550 --> 03:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
project they didn't have a project
 
03:57:19.269 --> 03:57:19.279 align:start position:0%
manager and that cost money it went on
 
03:57:22.429 --> 03:57:22.439 align:start position:0%
forever um so I had just a couple
 
03:57:24.750 --> 03:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
questions so the owner's representative
 
03:57:27.550 --> 03:57:27.560 align:start position:0%
who's the owner is it I I think that's a
 
03:57:29.030 --> 03:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
question's asked for them I had that
 
03:57:31.590 --> 03:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
discussion with the contractors back
 
03:57:33.469 --> 03:57:33.479 align:start position:0%
this morning and just a brief one with
 
03:57:36.429 --> 03:57:36.439 align:start position:0%
uh Miss Clark uh let's put that there
 
03:57:39.670 --> 03:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
because where this emanated from I'm of
 
03:57:41.910 --> 03:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
the perspective that we need to have
 
03:57:45.070 --> 03:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
good oversight of the project renovation
 
03:57:47.469 --> 03:57:47.479 align:start position:0%
or construction with somebody has a
 
03:57:49.469 --> 03:57:49.479 align:start position:0%
better understand this is for projects
 
03:57:51.830 --> 03:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
over a million dollars right if you're
 
03:57:53.389 --> 03:57:53.399 align:start position:0%
just putting in something less than that
 
03:57:55.110 --> 03:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need that right but
 
03:57:56.429 --> 03:57:56.439 align:start position:0%
when you're getting into these large
 
03:57:58.269 --> 03:57:58.279 align:start position:0%
projects it can be very costly and
 
03:58:00.030 --> 03:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
especially these change orders come down
 
03:58:03.550 --> 03:58:03.560 align:start position:0%
the pipe okay um I I have a couple
 
03:58:06.229 --> 03:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
questions so um and bypassing the
 
03:58:07.750 --> 03:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
executive Council and the physical
 
03:58:10.510 --> 03:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
committee um so a large chunk of money
 
03:58:13.630 --> 03:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
is given to the um Department of
 
03:58:15.670 --> 03:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
Education uh that's already gone through
 
03:58:17.830 --> 03:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
the general court
 
03:58:21.309 --> 03:58:21.319 align:start position:0%
and in as current policy without this
 
03:58:25.269 --> 03:58:25.279 align:start position:0%
stricken out would it then be if a like
 
03:58:27.830 --> 03:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
say Unity uh applied for a certain
 
03:58:30.269 --> 03:58:30.279 align:start position:0%
amount of money that that that would
 
03:58:32.269 --> 03:58:32.279 align:start position:0%
have to be approved by the executive
 
03:58:35.630 --> 03:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
Council so so it's more oversight on how
 
03:58:38.469 --> 03:58:38.479 align:start position:0%
the stuff how the money is uh
 
03:58:38.479 --> 03:58:40.229 align:start position:0%
the stuff how the money is uh
disseminated

03:58:40.229 --> 03:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
disseminated
 
03:58:42.469 --> 03:58:42.479 align:start position:0%
distributed I I'll I'll I'll go right
 
03:58:44.710 --> 03:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
from the beginning we have the
 
03:58:46.630 --> 03:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
application process goes out for the
 
03:58:48.550 --> 03:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure grants yeah
 
03:58:49.790 --> 03:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
they're submitted by the school
 
03:58:52.590 --> 03:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
districts to the commission the
 
03:58:55.269 --> 03:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
commission then asks Homeland Security
 
03:58:57.149 --> 03:58:57.159 align:start position:0%
because we have you know a criteria
 
03:58:59.830 --> 03:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
right now we're looking at it could be
 
03:59:01.510 --> 03:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
we we've had a lot of different uses
 
03:59:02.910 --> 03:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
that can be used for and you can see
 
03:59:05.670 --> 03:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
them in statute but we tried to Dy uh
 
03:59:07.429 --> 03:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
nail them down to certain areas
 
03:59:10.229 --> 03:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
surveillance Access Control
 
03:59:10.239 --> 03:59:11.790 align:start position:0%
surveillance Access Control
communications

03:59:11.790 --> 03:59:11.800 align:start position:0%
communications
 
03:59:13.950 --> 03:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
security and before we're going to get
 
03:59:15.309 --> 03:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
into the
 
03:59:18.030 --> 03:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh and some other areas
 
03:59:20.429 --> 03:59:20.439 align:start position:0%
it could even be used for a school bus
 
03:59:22.870 --> 03:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh this infrastructure money we want to
 
03:59:25.670 --> 03:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that the primary purpose that
 
03:59:28.070 --> 03:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
we see the intent of the bill is those
 
03:59:31.990 --> 03:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
areas I mentioned so then we also have
 
03:59:34.510 --> 03:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
as a commission established there will
 
03:59:37.910 --> 03:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
be a cap on how much any all districts
 
03:59:40.149 --> 03:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
will have what was is that cap at
 
03:59:41.870 --> 03:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
$100,000 that's right
 
03:59:44.910 --> 03:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
$100,000 no Grant will be wed out more
 
03:59:49.070 --> 03:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
than $100,000 for this specific project
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
so um it does make sure that the money
 
03:59:55.349 --> 03:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
is available and we've had well over 300
 
03:59:58.710 --> 03:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
different projects approved for this uh
 
04:00:01.550 --> 04:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
and uh now for the the council now so we
 
04:00:02.710 --> 04:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
make a
 
04:00:04.710 --> 04:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation that
 
04:00:06.830 --> 04:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh has always been a
 
04:00:09.189 --> 04:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation to fiscal and the
 
04:00:11.790 --> 04:00:11.800 align:start position:0%
executive counsel but with those
 
04:00:14.389 --> 04:00:14.399 align:start position:0%
guidelines which we have in place and
 
04:00:16.630 --> 04:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
the money has been approved for this the
 
04:00:19.469 --> 04:00:19.479 align:start position:0%
doe to spend then it really should go
 
04:00:22.030 --> 04:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
back to doe and and the money should
 
04:00:23.990 --> 04:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
immediately get used for that purpose
 
04:00:25.349 --> 04:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
rather than having to jump through these
 
04:00:27.750 --> 04:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
hoops they've all been approved in the
 
04:00:29.429 --> 04:00:29.439 align:start position:0%
past there's nothing the executive
 
04:00:31.870 --> 04:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
council's reversed and there's nothing
 
04:00:34.269 --> 04:00:34.279 align:start position:0%
that the fiscal has reversed seeing that
 
04:00:37.349 --> 04:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
much of this done is done in closed
 
04:00:41.229 --> 04:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
session um we have to go I used to call
 
04:00:42.710 --> 04:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
it executive session from the other
 
04:00:45.149 --> 04:00:45.159 align:start position:0%
state but we go in a closed session
 
04:00:47.790 --> 04:00:47.800 align:start position:0%
where the the we have our minutes the
 
04:00:50.590 --> 04:00:50.600 align:start position:0%
minutes but they're sealed at as you in
 
04:00:53.870 --> 04:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
the select Board of city council and um
 
04:00:56.189 --> 04:00:56.199 align:start position:0%
and there's reason for that to then have
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
to go through and explain the purpose
 
04:01:02.710 --> 04:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
and rationale behind those minutes to
 
04:01:05.110 --> 04:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
every on all those projects to the
 
04:01:06.830 --> 04:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
executive Council or fiscal we'd have to
 
04:01:08.950 --> 04:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
go into close session there too
 
04:01:11.110 --> 04:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
and you have to have Homeland Security
 
04:01:13.309 --> 04:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
Mr buckton would be there and of course
 
04:01:15.550 --> 04:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner would be there as well
 
04:01:18.750 --> 04:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
um this is a process that's been
 
04:01:22.469 --> 04:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
very it's been it's a long process it's
 
04:01:26.710 --> 04:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
duplicative and if there in as the
 
04:01:28.070 --> 04:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
feedback we've gotten from all the
 
04:01:29.990 --> 04:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
schools is this is a wonderful way of
 
04:01:32.910 --> 04:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
handling it we need it and but we want
 
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
to do it in the best the most
 
04:01:37.149 --> 04:01:37.159 align:start position:0%
expeditious manner we can okay you've
 
04:01:39.070 --> 04:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
convinced me on that one I have just one
 
04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
more on this followup and that is the
 
04:01:45.389 --> 04:01:45.399 align:start position:0%
checklist to a survey um it seems like
 
04:01:47.790 --> 04:01:47.800 align:start position:0%
uh with a checklist you'd get more
 
04:01:50.030 --> 04:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
responses than you would with a survey
 
04:01:51.670 --> 04:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
that that goes out where they'd have to
 
04:01:55.269 --> 04:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
provide the information and and um I'm
 
04:01:57.389 --> 04:01:57.399 align:start position:0%
just wondering isn't it more efficient
 
04:01:59.630 --> 04:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
to do a checklist than a survey I think
 
04:02:01.790 --> 04:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
that'd be a good question for them and
 
04:02:03.550 --> 04:02:03.560 align:start position:0%
because we have the 10-year plan which
 
04:02:05.910 --> 04:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
is we're encouraging districts to do a
 
04:02:08.750 --> 04:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
10-year CL plan forecasting what their
 
04:02:11.229 --> 04:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
needs are in those years so we as a
 
04:02:13.269 --> 04:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
legislature will be have a better idea
 
04:02:15.670 --> 04:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
how to appropriate dollars in line with
 
04:02:18.389 --> 04:02:18.399 align:start position:0%
need so ask that question to them okay
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome uh
 
04:02:20.399 --> 04:02:23.389 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome uh
representative

04:02:23.389 --> 04:02:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:26.510 --> 04:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
lakas um thank you for taking my
 
04:02:30.429 --> 04:02:30.439 align:start position:0%
question I'm just wondering if
 
04:02:32.790 --> 04:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
the owner
 
04:02:35.110 --> 04:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative could be the principal of
 
04:02:35.120 --> 04:02:37.149 align:start position:0%
representative could be the principal of
the

04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:02:37.159 --> 04:02:41.630 align:start position:0%
the
school

04:02:41.630 --> 04:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:43.990 --> 04:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
I have never done it that way it's
 
04:02:46.110 --> 04:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
always been a clerk of the works which
 
04:02:48.309 --> 04:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
we've hired I came into a district here
 
04:02:50.550 --> 04:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
though that had their main maintenance
 
04:02:53.349 --> 04:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
director doing it I've seen 10 to 15
 
04:02:54.830 --> 04:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
years later we were putting a brand new
 
04:02:56.750 --> 04:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
roof on top of the building because they
 
04:03:00.550 --> 04:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
entered exited the all the um vending
 
04:03:02.830 --> 04:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
from the art room downstairs up along
 
04:03:05.349 --> 04:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
the wall into the attic and the whole
 
04:03:06.590 --> 04:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
top of the building roof had to be
 
04:03:08.790 --> 04:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
replaced those like because it rotted
 
04:03:10.670 --> 04:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
out I've seen it done by a principal
 
04:03:13.149 --> 04:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
that's why I asking no the principal is
 
04:03:15.189 --> 04:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
not an engineer you know you can look
 
04:03:17.910 --> 04:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
and say is any asbest in this building
 
04:03:19.309 --> 04:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
there might be behind the wall how is
 
04:03:21.710 --> 04:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
that that how does that principal
 
04:03:24.590 --> 04:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
know and so we're looking for better
 
04:03:26.990 --> 04:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
information back we're talking about an
 
04:03:28.750 --> 04:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
expensive project we're looking at
 
04:03:30.429 --> 04:03:30.439 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that we know what
 
04:03:33.189 --> 04:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
the real needs are out there there's no
 
04:03:36.149 --> 04:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
sense doing a survey if the information
 
04:03:39.710 --> 04:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
in it is not coordin at and well put
 
04:03:43.469 --> 04:03:43.479 align:start position:0%
together so and we talked about trying
 
04:03:45.870 --> 04:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
to do surveys before when we had what
 
04:03:49.830 --> 04:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
was it close to 33 million square fet of
 
04:03:53.590 --> 04:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
of space in our schools today 33 million
 
04:03:55.349 --> 04:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the cost per square
 
04:03:57.630 --> 04:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
foot I've seen estimates where it's 5
 
04:04:00.070 --> 04:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
cents 10 cents 15 cents per square foot
 
04:04:01.429 --> 04:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
I would venture to say now it's more
 
04:04:04.389 --> 04:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
than any of those so this is important
 
04:04:06.670 --> 04:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
we get this right uh in terms of that
 
04:04:08.790 --> 04:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
question I would further ask the
 
04:04:11.189 --> 04:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
department whether it's the principal or
 
04:04:14.630 --> 04:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
the superintendent right or whomever
 
04:04:18.189 --> 04:04:18.199 align:start position:0%
thank you repr Damon thank you thank you
 
04:04:21.189 --> 04:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um which pertains
 
04:04:24.590 --> 04:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
to the page two two different parts
 
04:04:26.229 --> 04:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
where it speaks about air
 
04:04:26.239 --> 04:04:27.950 align:start position:0%
where it speaks about air
quality

04:04:27.950 --> 04:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
quality
 
04:04:31.269 --> 04:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
um so I'm wondering and this may be for
 
04:04:34.830 --> 04:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
them I'm not sure who to direct it to um
 
04:04:37.429 --> 04:04:37.439 align:start position:0%
on line 1819 where it says they changed
 
04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
the word review due to investigation
 
04:04:40.710 --> 04:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
shall require a physical assessment of
 
04:04:42.790 --> 04:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
the facilities not a measurement of air
 
04:04:45.189 --> 04:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
quality why wouldn't we want to measure
 
04:04:49.030 --> 04:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
the outcome the air quality that we are
 
04:04:52.030 --> 04:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
achieving and then further down the
 
04:04:55.510 --> 04:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
page um where the language
 
04:04:57.830 --> 04:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
encouraging implementing a program to
 
04:04:59.830 --> 04:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
provide and maintain good air quality is
 
04:05:03.469 --> 04:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
removed I'm a little concerned by that
 
04:05:06.229 --> 04:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
direction so could you maybe shed some
 
04:05:08.349 --> 04:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
light on why those changes are made once
 
04:05:11.389 --> 04:05:11.399 align:start position:0%
again I would ask the department on that
 
04:05:15.630 --> 04:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
um air quality is very very important I
 
04:05:18.070 --> 04:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
concur uh and there's national standards
 
04:05:20.189 --> 04:05:20.199 align:start position:0%
for this as well and that's an
 
04:05:23.870 --> 04:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
engineering Affair so thank
 
04:05:27.910 --> 04:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:29.950 --> 04:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
Woodcock represent I don't have a
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
question I just want to compliment you I
 
04:05:33.710 --> 04:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
love the visual going back to the me the
 
04:05:35.990 --> 04:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
mittens on the heers it brings back
 
04:05:40.510 --> 04:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:42.790 --> 04:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
and see and when I was in Alaska we had
 
04:05:45.830 --> 04:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
to close all the intakes on those
 
04:05:48.110 --> 04:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
because the one day in 25 years I had to
 
04:05:50.030 --> 04:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
call school off was the day the volcano
 
04:05:52.990 --> 04:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
went off and we had Ash in the air and
 
04:05:55.070 --> 04:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
so we didn't want to draw that Ash in so
 
04:05:57.950 --> 04:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
we had to put you know close all the
 
04:05:59.950 --> 04:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
intakes and inside the building it was
 
04:06:01.590 --> 04:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
worse than it was outside
 
04:06:01.600 --> 04:06:03.349 align:start position:0%
worse than it was outside
so

04:06:03.349 --> 04:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:06:06.429 --> 04:06:06.439 align:start position:0%
y thank you very much you're
 
04:06:23.790 --> 04:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:26.550 --> 04:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
Abbott thank you chairman uh for the
 
04:06:28.710 --> 04:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
record my name is Gary Abbott I'm the
 
04:06:31.030 --> 04:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
Executive Vice President of the
 
04:06:33.149 --> 04:06:33.159 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of New
 
04:06:35.950 --> 04:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I represent commercial
 
04:06:38.229 --> 04:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
building and Highway contractor and
 
04:06:41.030 --> 04:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
subcontractors in the state and it's a
 
04:06:42.630 --> 04:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be here before this
 
04:06:45.389 --> 04:06:45.399 align:start position:0%
committee I'm usually here supporting
 
04:06:47.349 --> 04:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
representative Lads bill because I
 
04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
really like School building Aid being
 
04:06:52.630 --> 04:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
added so my contractors can work but
 
04:06:56.229 --> 04:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
today I come to you with contractors
 
04:06:59.229 --> 04:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
rais some concerns about the section
 
04:07:02.590 --> 04:07:02.600 align:start position:0%
four of the bill uh where we change
 
04:07:05.910 --> 04:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
project manager to an owner's
 
04:07:10.389 --> 04:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:12.469 --> 04:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
I probably have to work a lot more with
 
04:07:14.590 --> 04:07:14.600 align:start position:0%
Amy to make sure I totally understand
 
04:07:16.510 --> 04:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
this and I won't tell you that
 
04:07:18.550 --> 04:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
contractors have the full picture as
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
well but years ago we had Clerk of the
 
04:07:22.950 --> 04:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
works and that wasn't a good enough
 
04:07:26.070 --> 04:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
definition we went to project
 
04:07:28.269 --> 04:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
manager and now we're trying to change
 
04:07:31.149 --> 04:07:31.159 align:start position:0%
it to an owner's representative and some
 
04:07:33.670 --> 04:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
of the contractors that work out there
 
04:07:36.109 --> 04:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
are interpreting this change that some
 
04:07:39.269 --> 04:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
very qualified people that are currently
 
04:07:41.309 --> 04:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
project managers will no longer be able
 
04:07:44.670 --> 04:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
to do that work and that the owner's
 
04:07:46.950 --> 04:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative who's on the State
 
04:07:50.990 --> 04:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
education list there's only four so they
 
04:07:53.389 --> 04:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
think that these only these four are
 
04:07:55.870 --> 04:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
going to end up with all of the work and
 
04:07:57.790 --> 04:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
I know there's usually only two schools
 
04:07:59.910 --> 04:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
that go through the funding but these
 
04:08:02.750 --> 04:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
four which would add cost to the project
 
04:08:05.469 --> 04:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
because if you limit it to just certain
 
04:08:07.990 --> 04:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
companies now this all comes about
 
04:08:10.109 --> 04:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
because of the definition what what are
 
04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
we defining we just want to be clear
 
04:08:14.950 --> 04:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
that the department defines it well now
 
04:08:16.429 --> 04:08:16.439 align:start position:0%
Amy's informed me they're in the middle
 
04:08:19.070 --> 04:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
of a rulemaking change where this comes
 
04:08:21.870 --> 04:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
in and that the contractors that have
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
told me this and why to oppose this
 
04:08:27.109 --> 04:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
section we may need we may come to an
 
04:08:28.950 --> 04:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
agreement of how this works and that
 
04:08:32.109 --> 04:08:32.119 align:start position:0%
some of those project managers of the P
 
04:08:33.309 --> 04:08:33.319 align:start position:0%
would meet the
 
04:08:35.510 --> 04:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
qualifications and meet the terms of an
 
04:08:38.349 --> 04:08:38.359 align:start position:0%
owner representative but this term has
 
04:08:40.630 --> 04:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
been used in other states and it means a
 
04:08:43.469 --> 04:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
certain thing to contractors and others
 
04:08:46.229 --> 04:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
so we're not sure where we are today
 
04:08:48.790 --> 04:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
with this language everything that's
 
04:08:50.910 --> 04:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
been said by representative lad is
 
04:08:53.590 --> 04:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
totally correct we want uh the
 
04:08:55.590 --> 04:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have the choice to
 
04:08:58.189 --> 04:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
make sure they pick the right whether
 
04:08:59.790 --> 04:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
you call it the owner's rep or the
 
04:09:02.030 --> 04:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
project manager to oversee the site and
 
04:09:04.750 --> 04:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
they should have qualifications to do
 
04:09:07.309 --> 04:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
that there probably isn't any expert on
 
04:09:09.630 --> 04:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
the planet that could do everything that
 
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
goes on on a construction and know
 
04:09:13.790 --> 04:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
everything but there are very qualified
 
04:09:16.469 --> 04:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
Engineers to do this so we're not
 
04:09:18.950 --> 04:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
objecting the other issue that has come
 
04:09:22.030 --> 04:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
up for us is when you put it in statute
 
04:09:25.030 --> 04:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
you mandate a certain thing and in here
 
04:09:27.070 --> 04:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
I don't see the definition I don't know
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
what this is statutorily and are we
 
04:09:32.830 --> 04:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
relying totally on rul making because
 
04:09:34.910 --> 04:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
I've seen this happen before we do this
 
04:09:37.910 --> 04:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
in statute and suddenly people say oh no
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
the intent this is what it meant and we
 
04:09:42.910 --> 04:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
get in a fight in the rul making process
 
04:09:45.389 --> 04:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
so I'm just bringing that to you I
 
04:09:47.510 --> 04:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
understand this bill making tweaks and
 
04:09:50.510 --> 04:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
corrections but I I right now have to
 
04:09:53.109 --> 04:09:53.119 align:start position:0%
represent my group who says it's not as
 
04:09:55.189 --> 04:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
clear and we're not sure what it would
 
04:09:56.830 --> 04:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
we don't want any unintended
 
04:09:59.590 --> 04:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
consequences of the language it sounds
 
04:10:01.309 --> 04:10:01.319 align:start position:0%
easy because when I first read it I
 
04:10:04.269 --> 04:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
agree probably with 90% of you that an
 
04:10:07.070 --> 04:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
owner representative the problem is some
 
04:10:09.550 --> 04:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
people made definitions in other states
 
04:10:12.269 --> 04:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
that make it a certain organization or
 
04:10:14.910 --> 04:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
group and they Define it further and we
 
04:10:16.550 --> 04:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
have a lot of projects that are either
 
04:10:18.309 --> 04:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
construction management in which it's a
 
04:10:20.990 --> 04:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
team with the local municipality where
 
04:10:22.950 --> 04:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
the decisions are kind of a group that's
 
04:10:25.910 --> 04:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
set up don't know exactly how that fits
 
04:10:28.149 --> 04:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
into the whole thing so it's more
 
04:10:30.389 --> 04:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
complicated than just you know you got a
 
04:10:31.510 --> 04:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
price for the school and we're
 
04:10:33.910 --> 04:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
constructing it it gets more complicated
 
04:10:36.910 --> 04:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
on my side so we want to work with you
 
04:10:38.790 --> 04:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
we're not a objecting to somebody
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
wanting a certain skill level every town
 
04:10:43.070 --> 04:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
right now has the power to require
 
04:10:45.670 --> 04:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
whatever they want but it is a cost and
 
04:10:48.510 --> 04:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
a cost on a project uh is something that
 
04:10:51.070 --> 04:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
you need to recognize so with that I'd
 
04:10:53.309 --> 04:10:53.319 align:start position:0%
end my testimony I'm looking forward to
 
04:10:55.469 --> 04:10:55.479 align:start position:0%
working with Amy I we we have worked on
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
a number of other things but I know
 
04:10:59.830 --> 04:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
Amy's going to supply me with some info
 
04:11:01.630 --> 04:11:01.640 align:start position:0%
and hopefully get some feedback from my
 
04:11:03.790 --> 04:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
contractors but I just wanted to put
 
04:11:05.389 --> 04:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
that on the table for the committee as
 
04:11:08.189 --> 04:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
you uh look at this bill
 
04:11:11.149 --> 04:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we have uh questions
 
04:11:13.189 --> 04:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank you Mr chair
 
04:11:16.349 --> 04:11:16.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
04:11:17.950 --> 04:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
should just background my husband's a
 
04:11:20.109 --> 04:11:20.119 align:start position:0%
retired contractor and I asked him to
 
04:11:23.630 --> 04:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
read this bill um so my question really
 
04:11:26.429 --> 04:11:26.439 align:start position:0%
comes from that discussion with him he
 
04:11:28.750 --> 04:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
referenced there being a model of a
 
04:11:32.149 --> 04:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
project manager being an employee of the
 
04:11:35.349 --> 04:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
contractor who is implementing the
 
04:11:37.910 --> 04:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
project and overseeing it
 
04:11:40.070 --> 04:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
from the contractor's point of view and
 
04:11:42.830 --> 04:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
that the um sorry I forgot the
 
04:11:45.710 --> 04:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
terminology here uh owner's
 
04:11:47.950 --> 04:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
representative which he perceived as
 
04:11:50.229 --> 04:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
being the same as a clerk of the works
 
04:11:52.109 --> 04:11:52.119 align:start position:0%
was the person looking out for in this
 
04:11:54.510 --> 04:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
case the school district is that a model
 
04:11:57.389 --> 04:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
that has been used in this context that
 
04:12:00.469 --> 04:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
makes sense I think there is and I think
 
04:12:03.590 --> 04:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
even the word project manager is can be
 
04:12:05.349 --> 04:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
have different interpretations of how
 
04:12:07.309 --> 04:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
that goes and that's why I say on the
 
04:12:09.710 --> 04:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
construction method it can have a a an
 
04:12:11.870 --> 04:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
implication and how that
 
04:12:14.269 --> 04:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
teamwork uh with the municipality and
 
04:12:16.710 --> 04:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
building it can matter too under
 
04:12:19.830 --> 04:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
different scenarios but I agree we just
 
04:12:21.109 --> 04:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
want to make it
 
04:12:23.070 --> 04:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
clearer uh don't want to make it more
 
04:12:24.910 --> 04:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
confusing originally when I met with my
 
04:12:24.920 --> 04:12:25.950 align:start position:0%
confusing originally when I met with my
building

04:12:25.950 --> 04:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
building
 
04:12:28.149 --> 04:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
contractors I said what would you like
 
04:12:30.950 --> 04:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
here and originally they wanted just to
 
04:12:33.149 --> 04:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
put leave it as a project manager or an
 
04:12:35.309 --> 04:12:35.319 align:start position:0%
owner's representative and leave it
 
04:12:38.910 --> 04:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
totally in the municipal hands and not
 
04:12:41.349 --> 04:12:41.359 align:start position:0%
end up statutorily locking it up to be
 
04:12:44.070 --> 04:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
one thing so that was the recommendation
 
04:12:45.429 --> 04:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
that I got out of the bills because I
 
04:12:47.710 --> 04:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
looked at and said what what do you do
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
you want me to try to Define an owner's
 
04:12:51.510 --> 04:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative or would you because the
 
04:12:54.429 --> 04:12:54.439 align:start position:0%
current practice is the use of a project
 
04:12:56.950 --> 04:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
manager and so that would make it clear
 
04:12:58.070 --> 04:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
but if you want to get into those
 
04:13:00.710 --> 04:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
details it really needs it goes beyond
 
04:13:02.389 --> 04:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
me I need to bring in the builders that
 
04:13:05.510 --> 04:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
do this that
 
04:13:08.349 --> 04:13:08.359 align:start position:0%
fall so when you ref current practice as
 
04:13:10.309 --> 04:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
a project manager that
 
04:13:12.510 --> 04:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
individual reports to whom the
 
04:13:15.229 --> 04:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
contractor or the school district or is
 
04:13:17.389 --> 04:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
paid by whom
 
04:13:20.309 --> 04:13:20.319 align:start position:0%
yeah or the municipality of however they
 
04:13:23.469 --> 04:13:23.479 align:start position:0%
structure it right um and I think that's
 
04:13:25.990 --> 04:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
what the municipalities are doing uh I
 
04:13:27.710 --> 04:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
know Amy's going to send me some rules
 
04:13:30.550 --> 04:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
of what the current guidance is so I
 
04:13:32.590 --> 04:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
think uh that's important too and I
 
04:13:34.590 --> 04:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
don't have that I have not reviewed
 
04:13:36.550 --> 04:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
those rules so I don't want to tell you
 
04:13:39.269 --> 04:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
yes or no until I really review
 
04:13:42.630 --> 04:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
those representative Woodcock thank you
 
04:13:44.750 --> 04:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
Corell good afternoon thank you for
 
04:13:47.149 --> 04:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
being here and trying to clarify some
 
04:13:49.510 --> 04:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
clear us up going back I'm Sim I'm down
 
04:13:52.469 --> 04:13:52.479 align:start position:0%
on lines 256 and 7 but I'm down as own
 
04:13:54.630 --> 04:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
as rep but I'm referring to your comment
 
04:13:58.349 --> 04:13:58.359 align:start position:0%
you said that the doe has four listed
 
04:14:01.550 --> 04:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
owners reps I think that's what you said
 
04:14:03.109 --> 04:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to figure out I don't see
 
04:14:05.670 --> 04:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
here anywhere it says that the owner
 
04:14:10.149 --> 04:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
reps have to come out the doe will be
 
04:14:12.149 --> 04:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
there I don't see anywhere that where
 
04:14:14.309 --> 04:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
it's where the doe is registering or
 
04:14:17.389 --> 04:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
hosting those and so could you clarify
 
04:14:21.630 --> 04:14:21.640 align:start position:0%
that for me uh I'm going to do what uh
 
04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative I'm gonna work with Amy
 
04:14:25.349 --> 04:14:25.359 align:start position:0%
on that because there is a list but she
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
said it wasn't limited and other people
 
04:14:29.510 --> 04:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
can get on the list so I need to get
 
04:14:31.349 --> 04:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
that that really goes to the definition
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
of what this list is the contractors
 
04:14:36.229 --> 04:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
have highlighted that list to me I
 
04:14:39.109 --> 04:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
haven't analyzed the list or the
 
04:14:42.070 --> 04:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
requirements she is this
 
04:14:47.670 --> 04:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
you is speaking next yes okay we will
 
04:14:49.269 --> 04:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
ask if there are questions for her thank

04:15:06.000 --> 04:15:10.830 align:start position:0%
 
Clark

04:15:10.830 --> 04:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:12.830 --> 04:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone uh for the
 
04:15:14.870 --> 04:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
record my name is Amy Clark and I'm with
 
04:15:16.870 --> 04:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
the school construction School building
 
04:15:18.309 --> 04:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
aid program at the Department of
 
04:15:20.070 --> 04:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
Education uh anything to do with school
 
04:15:23.109 --> 04:15:23.119 align:start position:0%
facilities goes through my Bureau um so
 
04:15:25.070 --> 04:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to Jump Right In and answer
 
04:15:28.189 --> 04:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
some questions or would you like to ask
 
04:15:30.269 --> 04:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
uh were there any questions that um you
 
04:15:31.990 --> 04:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
had noted that you wanted to answer to
 
04:15:34.229 --> 04:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
start off with um sure I'll just
 
04:15:35.910 --> 04:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
continue the conversation that I was
 
04:15:37.149 --> 04:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
just talking about before I talked talk
 
04:15:38.910 --> 04:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
about the other sections um the owner's
 
04:15:42.510 --> 04:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
project manager um interestingly the the
 
04:15:44.070 --> 04:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
department was just trying to make this
 
04:15:46.070 --> 04:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
clarification when we were doing rul
 
04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
making the the law when this law came
 
04:15:51.429 --> 04:15:51.439 align:start position:0%
about it was just as representative lab
 
04:15:53.910 --> 04:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
described it was to hire somebody the
 
04:15:56.070 --> 04:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
district to hire somebody that
 
04:15:58.790 --> 04:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
represents them because they don't know
 
04:16:01.109 --> 04:16:01.119 align:start position:0%
construction um they are the ones they
 
04:16:03.830 --> 04:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
need to hire somebody to be able to be
 
04:16:06.030 --> 04:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
the intermediator so that the contractor
 
04:16:07.990 --> 04:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
isn't saying you need to do this and the
 
04:16:10.030 --> 04:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
architect is saying you need to do this
 
04:16:11.510 --> 04:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
um they need to be able to have somebody
 
04:16:16.030 --> 04:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
that represents them uh so in the field
 
04:16:18.309 --> 04:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
there are two common term well three
 
04:16:20.510 --> 04:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
common terms one is the clerk of the
 
04:16:23.670 --> 04:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
works one is the owner's representative
 
04:16:26.429 --> 04:16:26.439 align:start position:0%
and one is the owner's project manager
 
04:16:29.790 --> 04:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
uh and so in the law we went to ruem
 
04:16:33.070 --> 04:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
make and we put owner project manager
 
04:16:36.189 --> 04:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
and somebody our rulemaking person said
 
04:16:37.830 --> 04:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
no you should use used the term that's
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
in the law so we went to the law and
 
04:16:42.309 --> 04:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
said oh it says project manager which
 
04:16:45.389 --> 04:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
that's confusing to because who is that
 
04:16:47.429 --> 04:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
project manager is that a contractor
 
04:16:49.349 --> 04:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's a project manager surely they
 
04:16:51.510 --> 04:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
have a project manager too the architect
 
04:16:53.710 --> 04:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
could be managing the project the point
 
04:16:57.389 --> 04:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
of this law was to hire somebody that is
 
04:17:00.830 --> 04:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
representing the owner so um I guess my
 
04:17:02.590 --> 04:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation to this committee would
 
04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
be to um take that project manager and
 
04:17:10.750 --> 04:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
call them an owner's project manager or
 
04:17:13.229 --> 04:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
an owner's representative I would not
 
04:17:15.109 --> 04:17:15.119 align:start position:0%
use the term Clerk of the works because
 
04:17:17.189 --> 04:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
it usually implies um a little bit
 
04:17:20.510 --> 04:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
lesser of a level than what um somebody
 
04:17:23.510 --> 04:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
overseeing the project would be
 
04:17:25.950 --> 04:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
um prior to this conversation I didn't
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
know we'd be talking about this this
 
04:17:30.030 --> 04:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
much um today but what I was going to
 
04:17:33.229 --> 04:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
recommend is that although I am the one
 
04:17:35.109 --> 04:17:35.119 align:start position:0%
that gave the language owner's
 
04:17:37.229 --> 04:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
representative to representative when he
 
04:17:39.950 --> 04:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
asked um I actually would change that to
 
04:17:44.469 --> 04:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
owners project manager um only because
 
04:17:46.590 --> 04:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
we've now gone through rulemaking we've
 
04:17:48.750 --> 04:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
heard some from some other constituents
 
04:17:50.750 --> 04:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
that said well owners project manager is
 
04:17:53.109 --> 04:17:53.119 align:start position:0%
kind of the term that more that we use
 
04:17:56.830 --> 04:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
around this area um so um with that said
 
04:17:59.389 --> 04:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to oh other things I just want
 
04:18:01.269 --> 04:18:01.279 align:start position:0%
to clarify we do have a list on the
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
department of education's website we
 
04:18:05.870 --> 04:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
don't vet them we don't vet anybody we
 
04:18:08.349 --> 04:18:08.359 align:start position:0%
just say oftentimes schools will call us
 
04:18:10.349 --> 04:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
and they want to know who has been an
 
04:18:12.309 --> 04:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
architect can we give them an architect
 
04:18:14.550 --> 04:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
name or an owner's project manager name
 
04:18:16.429 --> 04:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
and we just provide a list on the
 
04:18:19.070 --> 04:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
website of and we ask anybody who wants
 
04:18:20.910 --> 04:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
to be on that list they can be on that
 
04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
list they just have to tell us their
 
04:18:24.950 --> 04:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
contact information and if they've done
 
04:18:27.070 --> 04:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
any projects in New Hampshire that
 
04:18:31.269 --> 04:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
they've worked on um so um that owner
 
04:18:32.910 --> 04:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
we've had an architect list for a really
 
04:18:35.590 --> 04:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
long time but once this law came in
 
04:18:37.630 --> 04:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
effect um um
 
04:18:40.670 --> 04:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
2020 perhaps somewhere around there we
 
04:18:42.710 --> 04:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
started to compile a list of owners
 
04:18:44.790 --> 04:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
project managers I'm sure that list will
 
04:18:47.710 --> 04:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
grow um as people find out more about
 
04:18:50.710 --> 04:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
the list um but they don't they're not
 
04:18:52.790 --> 04:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
registered uh Massachusetts has a
 
04:18:55.710 --> 04:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
different um they actually go through a
 
04:18:59.590 --> 04:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
big process of um vetting their owners
 
04:19:01.269 --> 04:19:01.279 align:start position:0%
project managers but the New Hampshire
 
04:19:01.279 --> 04:19:02.269 align:start position:0%
project managers but the New Hampshire
does

04:19:02.269 --> 04:19:02.279 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:19:05.910 --> 04:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
not great uh yes representative Corell
 
04:19:08.710 --> 04:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Amy does having any
 
04:19:09.950 --> 04:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
kind of a list though give the
 
04:19:11.630 --> 04:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
implication to people who are looking
 
04:19:13.269 --> 04:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
that these are the four that have been
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
vetted and that you should choose from
 
04:19:18.030 --> 04:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sure there are some people that
 
04:19:20.309 --> 04:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
look at that list and say oh here's four
 
04:19:22.710 --> 04:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
these are the only four um we certainly
 
04:19:24.830 --> 04:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
I can see how the language is on the
 
04:19:28.550 --> 04:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
list um I I think that it says that the
 
04:19:30.269 --> 04:19:30.279 align:start position:0%
they're not recommended by the
 
04:19:32.309 --> 04:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh they're just
 
04:19:33.870 --> 04:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
a collection of lists but we certainly
 
04:19:35.710 --> 04:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
could make sure that that's more clear
 
04:19:37.510 --> 04:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
on there
 
04:19:38.990 --> 04:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
do you think just by having those four
 
04:19:40.670 --> 04:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
names though gives that implication and
 
04:19:42.670 --> 04:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
it might be better not to even have any
 
04:19:45.790 --> 04:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
names on it um I would say maybe it
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
gives that impli implic uh maybe it
 
04:19:51.790 --> 04:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
implies that um however um schools
 
04:19:54.630 --> 04:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
really need to know a starting point of
 
04:19:57.469 --> 04:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
you know people to to call so I guess I
 
04:20:00.030 --> 04:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to take that list off I'd
 
04:20:02.229 --> 04:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
be more interested in maybe sending that
 
04:20:04.469 --> 04:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
list to some of Gary's contacts or
 
04:20:06.349 --> 04:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
others to see if we can add more names
 
04:20:08.670 --> 04:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
to that list um we have not had a lot of
 
04:20:10.830 --> 04:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
projects that this has applied to uh
 
04:20:13.349 --> 04:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
only two so far so it's not like we've
 
04:20:15.550 --> 04:20:15.560 align:start position:0%
been going for a really long time uh
 
04:20:16.750 --> 04:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
with lots of projects out there that
 
04:20:19.269 --> 04:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
have needed to hire an owner's project
 
04:20:23.750 --> 04:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
manager R Tanner so from my previous
 
04:20:27.070 --> 04:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
experience with school building um and
 
04:20:29.550 --> 04:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
not having a project manager that was
 
04:20:31.990 --> 04:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
really a project manager seems to me
 
04:20:35.630 --> 04:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
that it should be a little bit more uh
 
04:20:38.670 --> 04:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
identified in in statute if that's what
 
04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to do that it it isn't just
 
04:20:45.030 --> 04:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who um built a couple of
 
04:20:47.870 --> 04:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
closets and uh you know maybe did a
 
04:20:50.830 --> 04:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
house and now uh you know is a project
 
04:20:53.389 --> 04:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
manager that there there should be some
 
04:20:56.830 --> 04:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
definition not not totally binding but
 
04:20:59.670 --> 04:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
at least on some qualifications and
 
04:21:01.349 --> 04:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
definitely state that they are the
 
04:21:04.349 --> 04:21:04.359 align:start position:0%
representative of the owner of of the
 
04:21:07.510 --> 04:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
project because the situation that that
 
04:21:10.269 --> 04:21:10.279 align:start position:0%
I was involved in it it really was
 
04:21:13.590 --> 04:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
so almost insestuous that that the you
 
04:21:15.910 --> 04:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
know the architect the contractor and
 
04:21:18.149 --> 04:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
the project manager ended up being one
 
04:21:21.269 --> 04:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
and the same correct and that was just
 
04:21:24.309 --> 04:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
really bad yeah I can say um right now
 
04:21:26.950 --> 04:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
the um uh draft regulations because the
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
statute required that we do um
 
04:21:31.630 --> 04:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
rulemaking on that um I pulled up the
 
04:21:33.710 --> 04:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
definition it is somebody who represents
 
04:21:36.389 --> 04:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
the district um and the minimum qualific
 
04:21:38.149 --> 04:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
appliations it currently says an
 
04:21:40.510 --> 04:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
architect or professional engineer
 
04:21:42.109 --> 04:21:42.119 align:start position:0%
registered by the state of New Hampshire
 
04:21:44.070 --> 04:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
with at least 5 years of experience in
 
04:21:46.070 --> 04:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
construction and supervision of
 
04:21:48.429 --> 04:21:48.439 align:start position:0%
construction of buildings or an
 
04:21:50.269 --> 04:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
individual with at least 7 years
 
04:21:51.790 --> 04:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
experience in the construction and
 
04:21:54.229 --> 04:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
supervision of construction of buildings
 
04:21:55.910 --> 04:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
meaning if you have an additional two
 
04:21:57.109 --> 04:21:57.119 align:start position:0%
years of experience you don't
 
04:21:58.510 --> 04:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to be a licensed
 
04:22:01.870 --> 04:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
engineer or architect there are a couple
 
04:22:03.750 --> 04:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
and there's probably more but I am aware
 
04:22:07.189 --> 04:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
of um some very talented uh facility
 
04:22:09.109 --> 04:22:09.119 align:start position:0%
managers uh in the state of New
 
04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that would probably be very
 
04:22:12.790 --> 04:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
good in the position of representing
 
04:22:14.630 --> 04:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
their school district as the facility
 
04:22:17.870 --> 04:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
manager themselves um so if they had
 
04:22:19.830 --> 04:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
that experience it would allow them to
 
04:22:22.990 --> 04:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
do that work um as long as they can um
 
04:22:24.950 --> 04:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
meet all the other requirements in the
 
04:22:27.109 --> 04:22:27.119 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:22:29.710 --> 04:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
rule yes represent
 
04:22:32.070 --> 04:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
Woodcock good afternoon thank you follow
 
04:22:34.269 --> 04:22:34.279 align:start position:0%
up on the question you addressed before
 
04:22:37.269 --> 04:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
um so I'm looking back the same lines 25
 
04:22:40.389 --> 04:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
26 27 the deal about establishing rules
 
04:22:42.750 --> 04:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
for the owners uh the owner
 
04:22:44.750 --> 04:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility it says the qualification
 
04:22:46.189 --> 04:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
for the school district that the doe is
 
04:22:48.670 --> 04:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
going to establish the rules so if I
 
04:22:50.109 --> 04:22:50.119 align:start position:0%
understand this right once those rules
 
04:22:53.109 --> 04:22:53.119 align:start position:0%
are established uh then the local uh
 
04:22:55.550 --> 04:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
municipality local project people they
 
04:22:58.030 --> 04:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
will be able to doesn't necess have to
 
04:23:01.109 --> 04:23:01.119 align:start position:0%
come off if that person they hire out of
 
04:23:03.389 --> 04:23:03.399 align:start position:0%
downtown meets these qualifications
 
04:23:05.429 --> 04:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
that're in rule they don't have any
 
04:23:07.469 --> 04:23:07.479 align:start position:0%
that's been connected with in terms of
 
04:23:08.830 --> 04:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
registering or any of that stuff it's
 
04:23:10.349 --> 04:23:10.359 align:start position:0%
just these are there correct if they
 
04:23:12.109 --> 04:23:12.119 align:start position:0%
choose to do that then they can his
 
04:23:14.469 --> 04:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
Association could bring that forward cor
 
04:23:17.109 --> 04:23:17.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely that list is not inclusive
 
04:23:18.590 --> 04:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
matter of fact there's actually no
 
04:23:19.870 --> 04:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
vetting to make sure that those people
 
04:23:20.830 --> 04:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
meet those
 
04:23:23.070 --> 04:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
qualifications so so doe is going to
 
04:23:24.910 --> 04:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
actually set the qualifications for this
 
04:23:27.109 --> 04:23:27.119 align:start position:0%
for this category of contractor that's
 
04:23:28.389 --> 04:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
correct and then the initial people have
 
04:23:31.590 --> 04:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
to use that those qualifications correct
 
04:23:33.790 --> 04:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you chair thank you
 
04:23:36.429 --> 04:23:36.439 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh yes represent
 
04:23:40.309 --> 04:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you so I'm moving on to the
 
04:23:43.389 --> 04:23:43.399 align:start position:0%
question I asked um and need more input
 
04:23:48.429 --> 04:23:48.439 align:start position:0%
on which is on page two line 1819 and
 
04:23:50.710 --> 04:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
also Roman numeral
 
04:23:53.830 --> 04:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
2 um both in reference to air quality
 
04:23:58.229 --> 04:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering why you can explain
 
04:24:00.510 --> 04:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
that we don't actually measure the air
 
04:24:03.109 --> 04:24:03.119 align:start position:0%
quality we just look at the things that
 
04:24:05.950 --> 04:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
influence it and then parallel to that
 
04:24:08.349 --> 04:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
why we are taking out or proposed to
 
04:24:11.269 --> 04:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
take out the language suggesting that we
 
04:24:13.389 --> 04:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
encourage implementing a program to
 
04:24:16.429 --> 04:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
maintain good air quality sure um so
 
04:24:18.189 --> 04:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
those are good questions uh thank you
 
04:24:22.109 --> 04:24:22.119 align:start position:0%
for that question the um purpose of this
 
04:24:25.630 --> 04:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
um amendment is to just clarify
 
04:24:30.830 --> 04:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
existing um existing law so it the
 
04:24:34.389 --> 04:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
department um I wasn't aware I wasn't
 
04:24:36.189 --> 04:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
around at the time this original
 
04:24:39.070 --> 04:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
language um was around about testing so
 
04:24:41.269 --> 04:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
we're not um asking for anything more
 
04:24:44.349 --> 04:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
stringent so I you know I guess yes if
 
04:24:46.149 --> 04:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
you wanted to include testing of air
 
04:24:48.830 --> 04:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
quality that's a good conversation to
 
04:24:53.070 --> 04:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
have um I think um probably since the um
 
04:24:55.229 --> 04:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
pandemic there's been a lot more focus
 
04:24:58.189 --> 04:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
on what those measures would be I would
 
04:25:01.309 --> 04:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
just say that if you're going to do that
 
04:25:03.550 --> 04:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
um then you're going to want to look at
 
04:25:06.229 --> 04:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
specifics about what they are testing
 
04:25:09.670 --> 04:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
four so we often times especially during
 
04:25:12.229 --> 04:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
the pandemic would get um people that
 
04:25:14.830 --> 04:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
would call and want some air quality
 
04:25:18.429 --> 04:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
test done to their facility uh
 
04:25:22.109 --> 04:25:22.119 align:start position:0%
and they can get an air quality test but
 
04:25:25.309 --> 04:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some standard to
 
04:25:27.910 --> 04:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
measure by because you could get data
 
04:25:29.630 --> 04:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't mean anything unless you
 
04:25:34.389 --> 04:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
say this size particle um is too high or
 
04:25:37.109 --> 04:25:37.119 align:start position:0%
too low um so I guess if you do go that
 
04:25:38.309 --> 04:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
route that would be one thing to
 
04:25:40.349 --> 04:25:40.359 align:start position:0%
consider but this the amendment wasn't
 
04:25:42.269 --> 04:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
to change anything that existing law
 
04:25:44.510 --> 04:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
already says that there's no requirement
 
04:25:48.830 --> 04:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
for testing um and then on Roman numeral
 
04:25:55.670 --> 04:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
2 so uh prior to this um the depart the
 
04:25:59.710 --> 04:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
um Environmental Protection Agency EPA
 
04:26:02.469 --> 04:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
used to provide these big boxes of
 
04:26:05.070 --> 04:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
indoor air quality tools you can open it
 
04:26:06.550 --> 04:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
up there's a SE
 
04:26:08.790 --> 04:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
there we have some that if you'd like a
 
04:26:11.910 --> 04:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
copy I'm happy to hand them out and we
 
04:26:14.790 --> 04:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
the department had to ensure that every
 
04:26:17.149 --> 04:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
school district had a big copy of this
 
04:26:19.710 --> 04:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
indoor air quality toolkit we could do
 
04:26:21.349 --> 04:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
that because I could give it to a school
 
04:26:22.950 --> 04:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
yes I've ured that they have that
 
04:26:25.309 --> 04:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
information that's all the law said well
 
04:26:28.429 --> 04:26:28.439 align:start position:0%
now it's all on an app and I have no
 
04:26:31.790 --> 04:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
ability to ensure that the that the
 
04:26:34.269 --> 04:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
school has installed the app so what I
 
04:26:36.389 --> 04:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
can ensure is that I will ensure that
 
04:26:38.469 --> 04:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
all the school districts are aware of
 
04:26:40.750 --> 04:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
this app and we can make sure that it's
 
04:26:42.910 --> 04:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
a really great app it has the checklist
 
04:26:44.710 --> 04:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
it has all the things that schools can
 
04:26:46.389 --> 04:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
use it's a really good tool for schools
 
04:26:48.990 --> 04:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
to use but I am not able to ensure that
 
04:26:51.109 --> 04:26:51.119 align:start position:0%
that's installed in a easy in an easy
 
04:26:53.790 --> 04:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
manner um so that's the only reason why
 
04:26:56.149 --> 04:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
we change the word encourage you know
 
04:26:56.159 --> 04:26:57.149 align:start position:0%
we change the word encourage you know
from

04:26:57.149 --> 04:26:57.159 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:26:57.159 --> 04:26:58.750 align:start position:0%
from
insure

04:26:58.750 --> 04:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
insure
 
04:27:01.750 --> 04:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
um uh so I guess if you have any other
 
04:27:03.469 --> 04:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
questions I guess that's the answer to
 
04:27:07.469 --> 04:27:07.479 align:start position:0%
that can I follow follow up thank you so
 
04:27:10.670 --> 04:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um your explanations are very
 
04:27:14.870 --> 04:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
clear however in that Roman numeral 2 I
 
04:27:16.990 --> 04:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
totally appreciate that you can't ensure
 
04:27:19.750 --> 04:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
that they looked at the app that's fine
 
04:27:21.590 --> 04:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
the app makes sense in today's
 
04:27:23.469 --> 04:27:23.479 align:start position:0%
technology not a big
 
04:27:26.030 --> 04:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
box but the taking off the language that
 
04:27:28.109 --> 04:27:28.119 align:start position:0%
we're not encouraging implementing a
 
04:27:31.030 --> 04:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
program is to me a different step than
 
04:27:33.269 --> 04:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
that and I don't I would like
 
04:27:34.550 --> 04:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
clarification of why we would want to
 
04:27:38.590 --> 04:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
take that out that yeah the a language
 
04:27:40.950 --> 04:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
could be amended for that it's simply I
 
04:27:42.469 --> 04:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
guess when you're amending language I
 
04:27:43.710 --> 04:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
would just keep in mind that we don't
 
04:27:46.710 --> 04:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
physically give away these CDs anymore
 
04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
um and that that tool is on an app app
 
04:27:52.149 --> 04:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
so however the language is amended is
 
04:27:57.309 --> 04:27:57.319 align:start position:0%
fine well if we Sorry may I yes thank
 
04:28:00.309 --> 04:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
you it seems to me we could just not
 
04:28:03.269 --> 04:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
take out line
 
04:28:06.030 --> 04:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
2829 just leave it where it is just Chas
 
04:28:07.590 --> 04:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
the first part that you're not
 
04:28:10.109 --> 04:28:10.119 align:start position:0%
ensuring that they look at the app but
 
04:28:12.510 --> 04:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
that we would still be encouraging air
 
04:28:12.520 --> 04:28:14.830 align:start position:0%
that we would still be encouraging air
quality

04:28:14.830 --> 04:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
quality
 
04:28:17.510 --> 04:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
program my
 
04:28:20.590 --> 04:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
thought thank you any further
 
04:28:23.550 --> 04:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much um if I
 
04:28:26.309 --> 04:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
may um there might be one other I just
 
04:28:29.349 --> 04:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
want to um talk a little bit if I may
 
04:28:30.790 --> 04:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
about the public school infrastructure
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
fund sure um I would also um on
 
04:28:34.800 --> 04:28:36.469 align:start position:0%
fund sure um I would also um on
online

04:28:36.469 --> 04:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
online
 
04:28:40.830 --> 04:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
2829 on page one um there is the public
 
04:28:42.990 --> 04:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure fund and it starts
 
04:28:47.030 --> 04:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
with Roman numeral 3 I would also um
 
04:28:48.830 --> 04:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
propose to this recommend to this
 
04:28:51.750 --> 04:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
commission that um committee that in
 
04:28:55.149 --> 04:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral one it talks about which
 
04:28:56.950 --> 04:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
you don't have in front of you but Roman
 
04:28:59.830 --> 04:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
numeral one of that law talks about who
 
04:29:01.469 --> 04:29:01.479 align:start position:0%
can apply for the public school
 
04:29:03.389 --> 04:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund and it says Public
 
04:29:06.790 --> 04:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
Schools can um and the commission the
 
04:29:08.070 --> 04:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure fund
 
04:29:09.830 --> 04:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
commission has also been talking about
 
04:29:12.030 --> 04:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
maybe making clarifications if
 
04:29:15.950 --> 04:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
preschools can public preschools uh that
 
04:29:19.550 --> 04:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
can also apply so right now if a public
 
04:29:21.750 --> 04:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
preschool applies for the public school
 
04:29:24.189 --> 04:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
infrastructure funds uh the commission
 
04:29:26.870 --> 04:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
is not able to recommend those projects
 
04:29:29.109 --> 04:29:29.119 align:start position:0%
uh so I from the commission they thought
 
04:29:31.790 --> 04:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
it would be a good idea for preschools
 
04:29:33.429 --> 04:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
to be able to apply for those funds so I
 
04:29:34.910 --> 04:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to throw that out there as
 
04:29:34.920 --> 04:29:37.670 align:start position:0%
just wanted to throw that out there as
well

04:29:37.670 --> 04:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:29:37.680 --> 04:29:43.389 align:start position:0%
well
all

04:29:43.389 --> 04:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:46.510 --> 04:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
right so just to get back to the air
 
04:29:49.710 --> 04:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
quality thing and the fact that that you
 
04:29:52.149 --> 04:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
say you know run tests but you've got to
 
04:29:55.630 --> 04:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
have like a a benchmark I guess is what
 
04:29:59.109 --> 04:29:59.119 align:start position:0%
you're talking about um the EPA actually
 
04:30:01.910 --> 04:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
has benchmarks for businesses and
 
04:30:04.229 --> 04:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
schools don't they is it just that New
 
04:30:07.149 --> 04:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has no bench benchmarks or
 
04:30:08.429 --> 04:30:08.439 align:start position:0%
we're not going by the federal
 
04:30:11.790 --> 04:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
guidelines or I would just point I would
 
04:30:13.229 --> 04:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
just say that if you're going to require
 
04:30:14.750 --> 04:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
testing that you point out those
 
04:30:18.030 --> 04:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
benchmarks if if you have specifics that
 
04:30:20.309 --> 04:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
you want schools to meet of different
 
04:30:23.830 --> 04:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
types of air quality standards that you
 
04:30:26.070 --> 04:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh indicate which air quality standards
 
04:30:28.910 --> 04:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
that you want schools to meet that's all
 
04:30:31.429 --> 04:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
just as a followup yes and so there's
 
04:30:34.950 --> 04:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
none uh in statute now and there's and
 
04:30:36.149 --> 04:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
there's none
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health and Human
 
04:30:41.429 --> 04:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
Services or the um Environmental
 
04:30:44.550 --> 04:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
Protection uh not that I'm aware of so
 
04:30:47.910 --> 04:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
how um and I could follow up with others
 
04:30:49.990 --> 04:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
on this that might know more than I do
 
04:30:52.429 --> 04:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is a lot of the
 
04:30:54.590 --> 04:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
standards for air quality are about the
 
04:30:57.109 --> 04:30:57.119 align:start position:0%
mechanical system that's put into place
 
04:30:59.990 --> 04:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
so if you are to build a new building
 
04:31:01.990 --> 04:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
you need to meet um air quality
 
04:31:05.389 --> 04:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
standards um with a mechanical system
 
04:31:08.309 --> 04:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
and HX system that can perform filter so
 
04:31:11.149 --> 04:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
many air exchanges and so forth um so
 
04:31:12.429 --> 04:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
it's different than going into a
 
04:31:16.389 --> 04:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
building and testing uh uh different Co
 
04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:34.560 --> 04:32:27.710 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:32:27.710 --> 04:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:30.070 --> 04:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon education committee hold
 
04:32:32.590 --> 04:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
on hold on sure trying to get to where
 
04:32:32.600 --> 04:32:34.429 align:start position:0%
on hold on sure trying to get to where
we

we
 
04:32:37.030 --> 04:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
are I was just going to say apologies
 
04:32:38.510 --> 04:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
for the printing that didn't go
 
04:32:42.109 --> 04:32:42.119 align:start position:0%
perfectly I'm sure we can make it work
 
04:32:54.790 --> 04:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:59.870 --> 04:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:04.230 --> 04:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
the okay so I think they're Criss
 
04:33:07.629 --> 04:33:07.639 align:start position:0%
crft minute this this mine right here
 
04:33:09.949 --> 04:33:09.959 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank
 
04:33:09.959 --> 04:33:18.070 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank
you

04:33:20.869 --> 04:33:20.879 align:start position:0%
okay okay we're going to go into our
 
04:33:24.310 --> 04:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
next bill which is 1153 FN this is an

act rela to mandatory and elected Public
 
04:33:28.349 --> 04:33:28.359 align:start position:0%
School curriculum and I'd like to
 
04:33:30.551 --> 04:33:30.561 align:start position:0%
welcome representative beler thank you
 
04:33:33.949 --> 04:33:33.959 align:start position:0%

4 so this is a longer bill it is
 
04:33:44.590 --> 04:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
contains a lot of curriculum contains a
 
04:33:45.750 --> 04:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
04:33:47.869 --> 04:33:47.879 align:start position:0%
pedagogy I encourage you to read through
 
04:33:49.150 --> 04:33:49.160 align:start position:0%
it I'm not going to go through every bit
 
04:33:51.990 --> 04:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
of this bill in the interest of
 
04:33:55.390 --> 04:33:55.400 align:start position:0%
time however I can reasonably predict
 
04:33:58.990 --> 04:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
that um this probably will be written
 
04:34:02.830 --> 04:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
off as an obvious violation of local
 
04:34:05.070 --> 04:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
control I would ask that you don't do
 
04:34:06.510 --> 04:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
that and that you take the time to
 
04:34:09.310 --> 04:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
Grapple with the substance of the
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill so I've provided written testimony
 
04:34:13.310 --> 04:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of the handout as to the
 
04:34:16.269 --> 04:34:16.279 align:start position:0%
rationale and substance of the bill
 
04:34:17.629 --> 04:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
however I'd like to start by talking
 
04:34:19.990 --> 04:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
about the idea of local control as it
 
04:34:21.990 --> 04:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
relates to this
 
04:34:26.269 --> 04:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
bill the first handout I have provided
 
04:34:28.551 --> 04:34:28.561 align:start position:0%

04:34:51.470 --> 04:34:51.480 align:start position:0%

legislation to accept these federal
 
04:34:57.070 --> 04:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
funds and as such the members of this
 
04:34:59.551 --> 04:34:59.561 align:start position:0%
house accepted These funds knowing that
 
04:35:03.189 --> 04:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
we were mandating curriculum of pedagogi

Core so as you can see from these
 
04:37:06.150 --> 04:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
handouts I've just went through
 
04:37:09.629 --> 04:37:09.639 align:start position:0%
through the concept of local control
 
04:37:11.709 --> 04:37:11.719 align:start position:0%
well perhaps an admiral one in theory is
 
04:37:14.390 --> 04:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
not something that actually exists the
 
04:37:18.590 --> 04:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
majority of our curriculum pedagogy and
 
04:37:20.150 --> 04:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
certainly the most consequential
 
04:37:22.709 --> 04:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
portions of it are coming from the
 
04:37:22.719 --> 04:37:23.709 align:start position:0%
portions of it are coming from the
federal

04:37:23.709 --> 04:37:23.719 align:start position:0%

04:37:25.750 --> 04:37:25.760 align:start position:0%

United

04:37:29.510 --> 04:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:32.629 --> 04:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
Nations even within this committee we
 
04:37:35.789 --> 04:37:35.799 align:start position:0%
don't always hold to the concept of
 
04:37:39.029 --> 04:37:39.039 align:start position:0%
local control just this past year we uh
 
04:37:41.590 --> 04:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
mandated additional Civics curriculum
 
04:37:43.670 --> 04:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
and even the inclusion of social media
 
04:37:46.750 --> 04:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
into public school
 
04:37:48.949 --> 04:37:48.959 align:start position:0%
classes so now as to the substance of
 
04:37:48.959 --> 04:37:49.949 align:start position:0%
classes so now as to the substance of
the

04:37:49.949 --> 04:37:49.959 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:37:52.990 --> 04:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
bill we have had a long history and a
 
04:37:54.990 --> 04:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
proud history in this state and in this
 
04:37:59.029 --> 04:37:59.039 align:start position:0%
country of an anti-fascist and
 
04:38:01.510 --> 04:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
anti-nazis education this is wholly
 
04:38:03.429 --> 04:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate I went to New Hampshire
 
04:38:05.150 --> 04:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
Public Schools I went I graduated
 
04:38:08.189 --> 04:38:08.199 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth I had the distinct pleasure
 
04:38:10.349 --> 04:38:10.359 align:start position:0%
of hearing from multiple Holocaust
 
04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
Survivors it was an indelible experience
 
04:38:15.949 --> 04:38:15.959 align:start position:0%
something I'll certainly never
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
forget but the truth of the matter is
 
04:38:22.029 --> 04:38:22.039 align:start position:0%
despite this education being appropriate
 
04:38:24.670 --> 04:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
much of the rest of our history has been
 
04:38:26.830 --> 04:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
lost in some ways you could say it's
 
04:38:27.830 --> 04:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
been redw
 
04:38:31.109 --> 04:38:31.119 align:start position:0%

04:38:34.349 --> 04:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
habit in this state a teaching and
 
04:38:34.359 --> 04:38:35.510 align:start position:0%
habit in this state a teaching and
curriculum

04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
04:38:37.189 --> 04:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
covering the
 
04:38:41.709 --> 04:38:41.719 align:start position:0%
atrocities of Communism of ma of Lenin
 
04:38:45.349 --> 04:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
of Stalin of paulot of CH of
 
04:38:47.830 --> 04:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
Castro and this is despite the fact that
 
04:38:51.189 --> 04:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
communism claimed an order of magnitude
 
04:38:54.830 --> 04:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
more victims than Fascism and in ways
 
04:38:57.070 --> 04:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
equally as
 
04:38:59.029 --> 04:38:59.039 align:start position:0%
terrible this is
 
04:39:01.510 --> 04:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
wrong it's time for acknowledgement of
 
04:39:04.109 --> 04:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
the historical crimes and the modern
 
04:39:06.470 --> 04:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
threat of the Communist
 
04:39:09.429 --> 04:39:09.439 align:start position:0%

04:39:11.670 --> 04:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution as it

our constitution says that the point of

government you can have no free
 
04:39:31.629 --> 04:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
government if communism becomes a
 
04:39:34.150 --> 04:39:34.160 align:start position:0%

day um
 
04:40:08.070 --> 04:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
I'm a registered Undeclared voter I'm
 
04:40:09.708 --> 04:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
also a credential music educator of
 
04:40:11.150 --> 04:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
three decades and I've taught in both
 
04:40:12.628 --> 04:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
public and private schools in Vermont
 
04:40:13.590 --> 04:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
and New
 
04:40:15.990 --> 04:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire politics doesn't come up very
 
04:40:18.830 --> 04:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
often in music class but when it has
 
04:40:20.590 --> 04:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
I've always prided myself on Playing
 
04:40:23.190 --> 04:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
devil's advocate without showing my own
 
04:40:25.270 --> 04:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
true feelings on the issue I always
 
04:40:27.990 --> 04:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
adopt the opposing view in the
 
04:40:30.150 --> 04:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
discussion whether the student is
 
04:40:31.948 --> 04:40:31.958 align:start position:0%
questioning whether the student in
 
04:40:34.190 --> 04:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
question is voicing a left or a
 
04:40:36.788 --> 04:40:36.798 align:start position:0%
right-wing Viewpoint this is because I
 
04:40:38.430 --> 04:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
feel that it is important for students
 
04:40:40.270 --> 04:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
to learn how to articulate their
 
04:40:43.150 --> 04:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
opinions in the face of an opposing one
 
04:40:44.990 --> 04:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
and if I can help them practice that in
 
04:40:47.350 --> 04:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
my classroom then I've done a small part
 
04:40:49.708 --> 04:40:49.718 align:start position:0%
of my job as an
 
04:40:52.230 --> 04:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
educator I'm ashamed to even have to
 
04:40:54.708 --> 04:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
come down here and testify against this
 
04:40:57.390 --> 04:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
bill this bill is a joke based on
 
04:40:59.830 --> 04:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
right-wing conspiracy theories the
 
04:41:02.470 --> 04:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
curricula that they seek to impose on
 
04:41:05.150 --> 04:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire students is is written
 
04:41:07.150 --> 04:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
by folks like and this is quoting from
 
04:41:09.550 --> 04:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
the text of the bill itself Mr James
 
04:41:11.990 --> 04:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
Lindsay who has been linked to several
 
04:41:14.350 --> 04:41:14.360 align:start position:0%
prominent conspiracy theories such as
 
04:41:18.670 --> 04:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
the lgbtq grooming conspiracy theory the
 
04:41:21.270 --> 04:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
white genocide Theory espoused currently
 
04:41:23.150 --> 04:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
by white supremacist Terror groups like
 
04:41:26.510 --> 04:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
NSC 131 who have recently protested
 
04:41:28.670 --> 04:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
within walking distance of this
 
04:41:31.230 --> 04:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
building um and the anti-semitic
 
04:41:35.190 --> 04:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
cultural Marxism conspiracy theory I've
 
04:41:36.788 --> 04:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
taught for over 30 years in multiple
 
04:41:39.470 --> 04:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
Schools public and private two different
 
04:41:41.788 --> 04:41:41.798 align:start position:0%
states you want to know the two
 
04:41:44.470 --> 04:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
occasions in all that time when I've
 
04:41:45.830 --> 04:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
actually heard of a colleague
 
04:41:48.670 --> 04:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
indoctrinating their students the first
 
04:41:50.830 --> 04:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
was back in the 90s at a private school
 
04:41:53.750 --> 04:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
in Vermont the colleague was a tenur
 
04:41:55.708 --> 04:41:55.718 align:start position:0%
well-loved teacher who happened to be
 
04:41:58.350 --> 04:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
very liberal and didn't bother to let
 
04:42:00.190 --> 04:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
that show in her
 
04:42:03.510 --> 04:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
classroom the other was last year when a
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
new hire at our school started lecturing
 
04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
about the evils of abortion not in a
 
04:42:10.750 --> 04:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
healthc care CL not in a health class or
 
04:42:12.910 --> 04:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
science class mind you but in His World
 
04:42:12.920 --> 04:42:14.070 align:start position:0%
science class mind you but in His World
Language

04:42:14.070 --> 04:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
Language
 
04:42:17.110 --> 04:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
classroom he was not rehired this
 
04:42:20.510 --> 04:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
year there is no leftist indoctrination
 
04:42:22.750 --> 04:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
happening in our schools based on my own
 
04:42:24.868 --> 04:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
personal experience there is just as
 
04:42:26.788 --> 04:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
likely to be right-wing indoctrination
 
04:42:28.750 --> 04:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire schools as left-wing
 
04:42:31.070 --> 04:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
indoctrination and the threat of either
 
04:42:32.990 --> 04:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
is statistically
 
04:42:35.390 --> 04:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
insignificant in Clos closing I would
 
04:42:37.510 --> 04:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
like to say that my wife who retired
 
04:42:39.110 --> 04:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
from a career teaching high school
 
04:42:41.030 --> 04:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
English last year prided
 
04:42:43.990 --> 04:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
herself on two things one of which was
 
04:42:46.230 --> 04:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
bringing local Holocaust Survivor kotti
 
04:42:48.750 --> 04:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
Preston to speak at our school and the
 
04:42:51.868 --> 04:42:51.878 align:start position:0%
other was in teaching her students how
 
04:42:54.868 --> 04:42:54.878 align:start position:0%
to find credible sources and site them
 
04:42:57.430 --> 04:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
properly if the text of this bill were
 
04:43:00.110 --> 04:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
given to her to read as an example of an
 
04:43:02.270 --> 04:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
assignment regarding finding credible
 
04:43:04.670 --> 04:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
sources she'd send it back with a
 
04:43:07.190 --> 04:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
comment for the student to reassess that
 
04:43:10.708 --> 04:43:10.718 align:start position:0%
competency please itl this crazy
 
04:43:12.990 --> 04:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much are there any
 
04:43:14.830 --> 04:43:14.840 align:start position:0%

coming here you're welcome um it's my
 
04:43:33.230 --> 04:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
pleasure how important is critical
 
04:43:35.788 --> 04:43:35.798 align:start position:0%
thinking uh
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
how much more important is critical
 
04:43:39.310 --> 04:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
thinking than actually content in
 
04:43:42.110 --> 04:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:44.868 --> 04:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
think all I know is that we we have a we
 
04:43:46.990 --> 04:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
have a we have a very large stem program
 
04:43:50.708 --> 04:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
in my school um we have we have a host
 
04:43:53.510 --> 04:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
of 3D printers we've got a a
 
04:43:53.520 --> 04:43:55.150 align:start position:0%
of 3D printers we've got a a
really

04:43:55.150 --> 04:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:43:58.670 --> 04:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
robust stem program and our Educators go
 
04:44:01.430 --> 04:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
out into local businesses and they ask
 
04:44:05.390 --> 04:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
the businesses what do you need in your
 
04:44:09.590 --> 04:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
employees and they routinely say things
 
04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
that I teach my students in band every
 
04:44:14.750 --> 04:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
year which is the ability to work
 
04:44:16.390 --> 04:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
together with groups of people that you
 
04:44:18.590 --> 04:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily see eye to eye with on
 
04:44:22.110 --> 04:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
every issue and form a coalition to work
 
04:44:24.430 --> 04:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
together around a common goal and to be
 
04:44:27.550 --> 04:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
flexible and to be able to improvise and
 
04:44:30.910 --> 04:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
to have social and emotional
 
04:44:35.150 --> 04:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
skills apart from also knowing whatever
 
04:44:37.708 --> 04:44:37.718 align:start position:0%
that discipline is that you or whatever
 
04:44:40.550 --> 04:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
that vocation is that you are working in
 
04:44:42.390 --> 04:44:42.400 align:start position:0%

04:46:36.270 --> 04:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
close the hearing for for
 
04:46:38.750 --> 04:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
1153 few
 
04:46:38.760 --> 04:46:42.190 align:start position:0%
1153 few
minutes

04:46:42.190 --> 04:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:44.670 --> 04:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
230 we're ahead of
 
04:46:44.680 --> 04:47:02.470 align:start position:0%
230 we're ahead of
ourselves

04:47:02.470 --> 04:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:05.470 --> 04:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
wow while we're here we can't we can't
 
04:47:06.948 --> 04:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
we're not going to go ahead and do any
 
04:47:09.150 --> 04:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
kind of exact session even if there was
 
04:47:11.470 --> 04:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
a bill that we agreed to seeing that we
 
04:47:13.230 --> 04:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
were missing several people critical
 
04:47:15.390 --> 04:47:15.400 align:start position:0%
people right now so I want to just go
 
04:47:16.990 --> 04:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
back and talk about the last bill which
 
04:47:18.670 --> 04:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with is the school
 
04:47:18.680 --> 04:47:19.750 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with is the school
building

04:47:19.750 --> 04:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
building
 
04:47:23.548 --> 04:47:23.558 align:start position:0%
stuff and I had a situation in our
 
04:47:26.310 --> 04:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
community where we this is not a school
 
04:47:28.310 --> 04:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
but it's a sizeable building it's one of
 
04:47:30.110 --> 04:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
the Cumberland Farm buildings which was
 
04:47:31.270 --> 04:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
built in
 
04:47:33.750 --> 04:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
Woodsville and there was a contractor
 
04:47:36.628 --> 04:47:36.638 align:start position:0%
sub contracted the electrical work to be
 
04:47:40.070 --> 04:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
done with an unlicensed
 
04:47:42.948 --> 04:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
contractor when the building inspector
 
04:47:44.830 --> 04:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
from the town looked at it the fire
 
04:47:46.708 --> 04:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
chief looked at it found it they had to
 
04:47:48.510 --> 04:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
rip everything out of the building and
 
04:47:50.390 --> 04:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
start all over again and lot of
 
04:47:53.548 --> 04:47:53.558 align:start position:0%
electrical work was behind walls this is
 
04:47:55.910 --> 04:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
why it's important now if that were a
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
Schoolhouse and that type of thing
 
04:48:01.310 --> 04:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
occurred the owner has to have good
 
04:48:03.430 --> 04:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
oversight of these with people that are
 
04:48:05.150 --> 04:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
trained to do that so when we look at
 
04:48:08.430 --> 04:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
owner's responsibility for manager
 
04:48:10.548 --> 04:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
project manager we have to make sure
 
04:48:12.750 --> 04:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
this is tight and that it's done
 
04:48:14.548 --> 04:48:14.558 align:start position:0%
properly in conjunction with the
 
04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
national standards our state standards
 
04:48:20.990 --> 04:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
and and and and with the local community
 
04:48:22.750 --> 04:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
the one that's coughing up the dollar in
 
04:48:24.910 --> 04:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
the state that there's there's somebody
 
04:48:29.510 --> 04:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
watching out for that Mrs so so yeah
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
represented Tanner so my experience uh
 
04:48:36.590 --> 04:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
they um the person that was the owner's
 
04:48:39.670 --> 04:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative um didn't know the the
 
04:48:42.190 --> 04:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
proper cocking to use on the windows so
 
04:48:43.590 --> 04:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
they had to tear out all the windows
 
04:48:45.390 --> 04:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
after the building was built and then
 
04:48:47.030 --> 04:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
they also didn't know the school
 
04:48:49.750 --> 04:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
standards on how many square foot per
 
04:48:51.708 --> 04:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
student nor did they realize that an
 
04:48:53.708 --> 04:48:53.718 align:start position:0%
elementary school now has to have a
 
04:48:57.070 --> 04:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
bathroom uh access off the classroom so
 
04:48:59.708 --> 04:48:59.718 align:start position:0%
you can imagine after the place was
 
04:49:01.990 --> 04:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
mostly built all these things being
 
04:49:04.470 --> 04:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
exposed how much money that in the world
 
04:49:07.470 --> 04:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
of Contracting that Unity issue really
 
04:49:11.310 --> 04:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
surfaced and was quite a problem and a
 
04:49:14.390 --> 04:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
costly problem at the end and this is
 
04:49:17.190 --> 04:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
for 100 students yes and I remember as a
 
04:49:19.150 --> 04:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
representative going into a meeting
 
04:49:20.830 --> 04:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
sitting in the front with all the town's
 
04:49:23.350 --> 04:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
people behind us and feeling like um I
 
04:49:25.070 --> 04:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to crawl under the table and
 
04:49:26.948 --> 04:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
crawl out the door before I got shot or
 
04:49:28.948 --> 04:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
something I mean it was it was really a
 
04:49:28.958 --> 04:49:32.390 align:start position:0%
something I mean it was it was really a
volatile

04:49:32.390 --> 04:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:34.708 --> 04:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
situation yeah ex a
 
04:49:38.070 --> 04:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
well it has been a case study that's why
 
04:49:39.948 --> 04:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
you though you say Unity when it comes
 
04:49:43.230 --> 04:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
to contractors they know all about it
 
04:49:44.670 --> 04:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
and they know that that we have certain
 
04:49:47.548 --> 04:49:47.558 align:start position:0%
standards on space and size and all that
 
04:49:49.548 --> 04:49:49.558 align:start position:0%
and yes we can go beyond that because
 
04:49:52.030 --> 04:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
any local District can build a a castle
 
04:49:53.628 --> 04:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
if they want but they're going to have
 
04:49:56.430 --> 04:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
to pay the difference but uh this is
 
04:49:58.310 --> 04:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
definitely a baseline which we always
 
04:50:01.110 --> 04:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
want to watch and this bill is important
 
04:50:04.390 --> 04:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
and um we need to work with uh
 
04:50:05.948 --> 04:50:05.958 align:start position:0%
Amy and the
 
04:50:09.150 --> 04:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
contractors and and and involved with
 
04:50:10.990 --> 04:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
school boards as well because they are
 
04:50:12.670 --> 04:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
the owners of the building and they're
 
04:50:14.590 --> 04:50:14.600 align:start position:0%
paying a huge difference that local
 
04:50:17.030 --> 04:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
community so we will get on top of it
 
04:50:19.070 --> 04:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that if we do move this thing
 
04:50:21.750 --> 04:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
forward we move it forward with language
 
04:50:23.110 --> 04:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
which is appropriate that's why
 
04:50:26.190 --> 04:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
initially we had pro project manager and
 
04:50:28.070 --> 04:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
then we had responsibilities and
 
04:50:29.830 --> 04:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
qualifications and when we looked at
 
04:50:31.830 --> 04:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
qualifications we were talking about
 
04:50:33.628 --> 04:50:33.638 align:start position:0%
certified people but that never got
 
04:50:33.638 --> 04:50:34.430 align:start position:0%
certified people but that never got
there

04:50:34.430 --> 04:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:50:37.270 --> 04:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
you know licensed people to be doing
 
04:50:39.430 --> 04:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
this can we put that in the definition
 
04:50:41.150 --> 04:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
we can do anything we want with it we're
 
04:50:42.990 --> 04:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
the legislator we can do whatever we
 
04:50:45.868 --> 04:50:45.878 align:start position:0%
want with with a definition like to put
 
04:50:48.150 --> 04:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
definition with those in it and and when
 
04:50:50.948 --> 04:50:50.958 align:start position:0%
we do that it will become rule just
 
04:50:52.708 --> 04:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
because we're on board starting on the
 
04:50:54.670 --> 04:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
rule process somewhere else doesn't mean
 
04:50:57.868 --> 04:50:57.878 align:start position:0%
that we have to go along with that so uh
 
04:50:59.390 --> 04:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of case studies we can
 
04:51:01.190 --> 04:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
look at both in this state and outside
 
04:51:03.310 --> 04:51:03.320 align:start position:0%
and building have looked at them and
 
04:51:05.310 --> 04:51:05.320 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of information for us on
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
this particular topic and in conjunction
 
04:51:11.190 --> 04:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
with air quality we do have standards in
 
04:51:13.270 --> 04:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
place we remember Dees when we were
 
04:51:15.948 --> 04:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
looking at Water standards and Arsenic
 
04:51:17.788 --> 04:51:17.798 align:start position:0%
and water and all that and how we're
 
04:51:19.628 --> 04:51:19.638 align:start position:0%
identifying with that we've had closed
 
04:51:21.510 --> 04:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
schools down because of Arsenic and
 
04:51:24.510 --> 04:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
water and bottle it in we need to do the
 
04:51:26.190 --> 04:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
same thing in terms of
 
04:51:29.230 --> 04:51:29.240 align:start position:0%
air so there's work to be done I think
 
04:51:32.110 --> 04:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
we can get it done is is the air going
 
04:51:36.868 --> 04:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
to be all existing buildings or just new
 
04:51:39.230 --> 04:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
construction because I'm just trying to
 
04:51:40.670 --> 04:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
04:51:44.390 --> 04:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
Al how you would possibly redo the air
 
04:51:47.548 --> 04:51:47.558 align:start position:0%
system in that old building without
 
04:51:49.868 --> 04:51:49.878 align:start position:0%
tearing half the building down remember
 
04:51:52.270 --> 04:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
the what that this bill says we're
 
04:51:54.948 --> 04:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
investigating or reviewing buildings
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
which we have in terms of trying to
 
04:51:59.310 --> 04:51:59.320 align:start position:0%
prioritize on the 10-year
 
04:52:02.190 --> 04:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
plan which ones top come to the top of
 
04:52:04.670 --> 04:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
the surface for you know rece funding so
 
04:52:06.868 --> 04:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
yes we got to look at air quality and
 
04:52:11.270 --> 04:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
all our 300 plus facilities in the state
 
04:52:15.390 --> 04:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
same they did when they the
 
04:52:19.070 --> 04:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
L got yeah
 
04:52:23.110 --> 04:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:25.548 --> 04:52:25.558 align:start position:0%
CLE we we got to remember too we got to
 
04:52:27.110 --> 04:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
stay within our means remember I
 
04:52:30.270 --> 04:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have 33 million square feet
 
04:52:32.190 --> 04:52:32.200 align:start position:0%
if you multiply that times 10 cents per
 
04:52:34.230 --> 04:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
square feet we're talking 3.3 million
 
04:52:37.390 --> 04:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
just for that survey so that's been the
 
04:52:40.230 --> 04:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
hangup in the past and that's why we we
 
04:52:42.430 --> 04:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
haven't gone forward with the absolutes
 
04:52:44.230 --> 04:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
which we need to
 
04:52:47.830 --> 04:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
do I know the what we used as our third
 
04:52:50.270 --> 04:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
grade building for years in Hudson I
 
04:52:51.990 --> 04:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
remember just spending a day there I had
 
04:52:53.948 --> 04:52:53.958 align:start position:0%
a horrible headache and my daughter
 
04:52:55.350 --> 04:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
would come home with a headache every
 
04:52:57.590 --> 04:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
day but they eventually made it our
 
04:52:59.990 --> 04:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent's office and when we
 
04:53:04.948 --> 04:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
built a new elementary school and the co
 
04:53:08.070 --> 04:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
levels in that building were huge were
 
04:53:09.750 --> 04:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
so high and that's why people were
 
04:53:12.390 --> 04:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
getting such horrible headaches but they
 
04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
didn't check it when it was an education
 
04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
building they checked it when it was a
 
04:53:17.750 --> 04:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent building well that's
 
04:53:20.628 --> 04:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
going to all find things like mold which
 
04:53:24.548 --> 04:53:24.558 align:start position:0%
is in the air and they lots of speci too
 
04:53:26.390 --> 04:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
and there's mold in these older homes
 
04:53:27.910 --> 04:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
some of them are putting special ed into
 
04:53:29.708 --> 04:53:29.718 align:start position:0%
a separate building and that's just
 
04:53:32.548 --> 04:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
loaded with it yeah those are the
 
04:53:32.558 --> 04:53:41.430 align:start position:0%
loaded with it yeah those are the
problems

04:53:41.430 --> 04:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:44.590 --> 04:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
so what what was the final
 
04:53:48.310 --> 04:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
disposition of the the dialogue we had
 
04:53:57.510 --> 04:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:01.990 --> 04:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
issues Hearing in
 
04:54:04.628 --> 04:54:04.638 align:start position:0%
school right
 
04:54:04.638 --> 04:54:06.230 align:start position:0%
school right
hearing

04:54:06.230 --> 04:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:54:10.350 --> 04:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
disabled Pro kids with hearing problems
 
04:54:14.868 --> 04:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:16.670 --> 04:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation I don't know if they' put
 
04:54:17.948 --> 04:54:17.958 align:start position:0%
that in rule or what they've done with
 
04:54:19.708 --> 04:54:19.718 align:start position:0%
it there's a lot of issues out there
 
04:54:22.548 --> 04:54:22.558 align:start position:0%
just like the stuff on top is lighting a
 
04:54:24.310 --> 04:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
lot of the grade schools have crummy
 
04:54:25.990 --> 04:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
lighting and kids are trying to learn
 
04:54:27.628 --> 04:54:27.638 align:start position:0%
how to and there's a shadow everywhere
 
04:54:29.350 --> 04:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
they are and that's it's impacting
 
04:54:31.990 --> 04:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
learning there too these are all things
 
04:54:33.470 --> 04:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
which we got to make sure it gets into
 
04:54:36.430 --> 04:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
to our new construction and
 
04:54:38.350 --> 04:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
renovation I think there was an issue
 
04:54:40.150 --> 04:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
with that one because they were looking
 
04:54:44.110 --> 04:54:44.120 align:start position:0%
at um New Quality um or standards that
 
04:54:45.868 --> 04:54:45.878 align:start position:0%
had not been approved or anything else
 
04:54:48.470 --> 04:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
yet something along those lines we have
 
04:54:50.110 --> 04:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
to look into
 
04:54:50.120 --> 04:54:52.990 align:start position:0%
to look into
it

04:54:52.990 --> 04:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:54:55.390 --> 04:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
right okay we still have about five six
 
04:54:56.548 --> 04:54:56.558 align:start position:0%
minutes if you want to get up and
 
04:55:01.070 --> 04:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:05.430 --> 04:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:05.440 --> 04:55:07.390 align:start position:0%
 
mhm

04:55:07.390 --> 04:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
mhm
 
04:55:07.400 --> 04:55:32.390 align:start position:0%
mhm
yeah

04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:32.400 --> 05:04:27.150 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:04:27.150 --> 05:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:30.788 --> 05:04:30.798 align:start position:0%
we're back on uh schedule um and it's
 
05:04:34.430 --> 05:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
time for uh house Bill 1160 relative to
 
05:04:38.070 --> 05:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
school assessments of Statewide academic
 
05:04:41.190 --> 05:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
standards and um chairman lad is uh
 
05:04:43.110 --> 05:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
ready to go thank you very much uh
 
05:04:44.868 --> 05:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli and members of
 
05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record uh my
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
name is Rick lad I come from haal New
 
05:04:54.190 --> 05:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here to present 1160
 
05:04:55.948 --> 05:04:55.958 align:start position:0%
which is relative to school assessments
 
05:04:57.868 --> 05:04:57.878 align:start position:0%
of Statewide academic
 
05:05:00.590 --> 05:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
areas if you take a look at the bill
 
05:05:02.948 --> 05:05:02.958 align:start position:0%
which is very short kind of walk through
 
05:05:05.830 --> 05:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
it with you and try to explain why we're
 
05:05:09.310 --> 05:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
doing what we're doing here um it's
 
05:05:11.270 --> 05:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
areas of assessment this area is in
 
05:05:14.670 --> 05:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
Statute in 193c Colon 5 right now and
 
05:05:16.430 --> 05:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's where we're talking about the
 
05:05:19.230 --> 05:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment for improvement and
 
05:05:23.070 --> 05:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
assessment in the subject areas which we
 
05:05:26.230 --> 05:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh use in that regard and it reflects
 
05:05:28.150 --> 05:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
back at
 
05:05:30.990 --> 05:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
193e colon
 
05:05:33.830 --> 05:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
3-2a those that's the area where we talk
 
05:05:36.708 --> 05:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
about the substantive criteria those
 
05:05:39.670 --> 05:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
subjects which are part of an adequate
 
05:05:42.070 --> 05:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
education the Statewide
 
05:05:44.430 --> 05:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
assessment which you see in lines three
 
05:05:47.590 --> 05:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
and four and start the areas of
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
assessment are in language arts
 
05:05:51.990 --> 05:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
mathematics science those are the area
 
05:05:54.230 --> 05:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
reading included those are the areas
 
05:05:56.750 --> 05:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
which we assess on that Statewide
 
05:05:58.910 --> 05:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
assessment but we have other areas
 
05:06:01.670 --> 05:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
within the criteria for an adequate
 
05:06:05.110 --> 05:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
education which are not tested or for
 
05:06:07.470 --> 05:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
improvement or assessed uh by the
 
05:06:09.990 --> 05:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment and those subject
 
05:06:11.990 --> 05:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
areas are history currently history
 
05:06:15.510 --> 05:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
geography civics and economics remaining
 
05:06:18.190 --> 05:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
required critical areas of
 
05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
study we have now added to that through
 
05:06:24.830 --> 05:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
legislation last year the subject of
 
05:06:27.590 --> 05:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
government so government has been added
 
05:06:31.628 --> 05:06:31.638 align:start position:0%
in here it's a required critical area of
 
05:06:31.638 --> 05:06:34.230 align:start position:0%
in here it's a required critical area of
study

05:06:34.230 --> 05:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
study
 
05:06:36.628 --> 05:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
therefore we don't test it with the
 
05:06:40.670 --> 05:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment these subject areas
 
05:06:43.270 --> 05:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
history government geography civics and
 
05:06:45.910 --> 05:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
economics are not included in the
 
05:06:49.390 --> 05:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
Statewide Assessment program but they
 
05:06:51.270 --> 05:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
remain within the purview of the local
 
05:06:54.390 --> 05:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
school board we still have to assess but
 
05:06:56.390 --> 05:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
the state's not going to do that is a
 
05:06:58.910 --> 05:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
local responsibility to assess these
 
05:06:58.920 --> 05:07:00.310 align:start position:0%
local responsibility to assess these
subject

05:07:00.310 --> 05:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
subject
 
05:07:03.390 --> 05:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
areas it goes on to say the local school
 
05:07:06.868 --> 05:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
board shall require that each School
 
05:07:09.310 --> 05:07:09.320 align:start position:0%
provide for ongoing assessment of
 
05:07:11.510 --> 05:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
required critical areas of study
 
05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
critical areas of studies reflects back
 
05:07:15.990 --> 05:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
to the word critical areas of study in
 
05:07:18.750 --> 05:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
line five and those subjects we're
 
05:07:18.760 --> 05:07:19.948 align:start position:0%
line five and those subjects we're
talking

05:07:19.948 --> 05:07:19.958 align:start position:0%
talking
 
05:07:22.350 --> 05:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
about through the use of local
 
05:07:25.190 --> 05:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
assessments so you want to assess you
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
can assess it can be the chapter test it
 
05:07:29.190 --> 05:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
can be the preest it can be the post
 
05:07:30.590 --> 05:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
test of whatever materials you're
 
05:07:33.070 --> 05:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
teaching in terms of those critical
 
05:07:35.310 --> 05:07:35.320 align:start position:0%
areas history government geography
 
05:07:37.390 --> 05:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
civics and
 
05:07:40.510 --> 05:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
economics that are and the last part of
 
05:07:44.350 --> 05:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
that is critical that this assessment be
 
05:07:48.390 --> 05:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
aligned with the State academic
 
05:07:51.310 --> 05:07:51.320 align:start position:0%
standards so we want to make sure that
 
05:07:53.868 --> 05:07:53.878 align:start position:0%
what's going on the state board has
 
05:07:56.390 --> 05:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
approved standards for these subject
 
05:07:59.470 --> 05:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
areas as part of social studies so
 
05:08:02.430 --> 05:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
anything that you use at the local level
 
05:08:05.190 --> 05:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
must be aligned with those academic
 
05:08:07.910 --> 05:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
standards but you the Local District are
 
05:08:11.270 --> 05:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
going to design or use the assessment
 
05:08:13.030 --> 05:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
that you've always been using and
 
05:08:14.868 --> 05:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
hopefully that is aligned with the
 
05:08:18.230 --> 05:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
academic standards of civics government
 
05:08:20.390 --> 05:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
economics geography
 
05:08:24.110 --> 05:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
Etc so basically that's the Crux of that
 
05:08:26.070 --> 05:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
seeing these standards are board
 
05:08:28.110 --> 05:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
approved not local board approved
 
05:08:30.350 --> 05:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
they're state board approved the state
 
05:08:32.150 --> 05:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
board has responsibility for approving
 
05:08:34.628 --> 05:08:34.638 align:start position:0%
approving the State academic standards
 
05:08:36.310 --> 05:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
and the minimum standards of public
 
05:08:39.150 --> 05:08:39.160 align:start position:0%
school approval and you remember several
 
05:08:41.830 --> 05:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
weeks ago we put oversight we already
 
05:08:43.910 --> 05:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
have oversight for the academic
 
05:08:46.708 --> 05:08:46.718 align:start position:0%
standards and we passed a bill where we
 
05:08:49.030 --> 05:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
have oversight as a legislature over the
 
05:08:50.430 --> 05:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
minimum standards of public school
 
05:08:52.830 --> 05:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
approval as well so this is kind of a
 
05:08:55.910 --> 05:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
followup to that bill which we passed
 
05:08:58.788 --> 05:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
but also uh including this critical area
 
05:09:01.628 --> 05:09:01.638 align:start position:0%
of government which has not been in law
 
05:09:03.910 --> 05:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
which is in law already we put in last
 
05:09:05.788 --> 05:09:05.798 align:start position:0%
year now they're they're responsible for
 
05:09:07.430 --> 05:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
the assessment on the local level so
 
05:09:09.350 --> 05:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
I'll conclude my testimony that's a
 
05:09:11.868 --> 05:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
brief you know a summary of what we're
 
05:09:14.150 --> 05:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
doing in in this legislation right
 
05:09:17.350 --> 05:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
here uh thank you representative uh
 
05:09:19.830 --> 05:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:09:21.990 --> 05:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative Woodcock
 
05:09:24.590 --> 05:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um representative lad so
 
05:09:28.510 --> 05:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
on the the government piece of this and
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
and we're talking I'm looking at the
 
05:09:32.910 --> 05:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
last couple lines 11 and 12 the L does
 
05:09:34.868 --> 05:09:34.878 align:start position:0%
the state has the State Board already
 
05:09:37.350 --> 05:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
approved academic standards for that
 
05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's part of social studies and where we
 
05:09:41.150 --> 05:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
see government here it doesn't have to
 
05:09:42.990 --> 05:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
be a separate class it could be meshed
 
05:09:45.990 --> 05:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
in with Civics it could be me meshed
 
05:09:48.110 --> 05:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
which we have remember we required a
 
05:09:50.750 --> 05:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
Civics course be taught right one half
 
05:09:53.390 --> 05:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
here in middle school and there again
 
05:09:56.310 --> 05:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
again in high school and what we you
 
05:09:58.788 --> 05:09:58.798 align:start position:0%
could do is for example if you're a
 
05:10:02.110 --> 05:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
grade school teacher grade five where
 
05:10:03.910 --> 05:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
lot of times they do a beginning course
 
05:10:07.150 --> 05:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
in US government or America It's usually
 
05:10:09.510 --> 05:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
the state in the fourth grade you could
 
05:10:11.830 --> 05:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
mesh in government that's involved like
 
05:10:13.990 --> 05:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
your local government locally here
 
05:10:17.150 --> 05:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
middle estate and and and the national
 
05:10:19.110 --> 05:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
within so you could have one assessment
 
05:10:20.750 --> 05:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
it's probably right within your social
 
05:10:23.070 --> 05:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
studies course so you are assessing
 
05:10:25.030 --> 05:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
we're not telling people how the
 
05:10:26.390 --> 05:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
assessment has to look the assessment
 
05:10:29.030 --> 05:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
might not even be a test it may some be
 
05:10:31.310 --> 05:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
some kind of report that's written or it
 
05:10:34.230 --> 05:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
might be a project which they've made
 
05:10:35.628 --> 05:10:35.638 align:start position:0%
there's a lot we've talked about this
 
05:10:38.190 --> 05:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
before assessments can be done many
 
05:10:40.628 --> 05:10:40.638 align:start position:0%
ways follow I just I was just
 
05:10:41.910 --> 05:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
specifically concerned about the
 
05:10:44.110 --> 05:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
government piece if the state had had
 
05:10:45.830 --> 05:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
approved any standards I heard what you
 
05:10:48.270 --> 05:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
said represent L it's in the social
 
05:10:50.190 --> 05:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
science area already but it's in the
 
05:10:52.548 --> 05:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
standards approved back in
 
05:10:55.390 --> 05:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
2006 by the state board okay but
 
05:10:57.990 --> 05:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
government wasn't in there
 
05:11:01.030 --> 05:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
2006 but the topic of government was
 
05:11:02.470 --> 05:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
taught back then
 
05:11:05.868 --> 05:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
sure but uh the the standards are meshed
 
05:11:07.628 --> 05:11:07.638 align:start position:0%
into the Frameworks and we've talked
 
05:11:10.670 --> 05:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
about Frameworks before and that's why
 
05:11:13.310 --> 05:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
we passed what we did the other day yeah
 
05:11:16.190 --> 05:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
yeah and and saying we want to see those
 
05:11:19.510 --> 05:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay standards defined in the the
 
05:11:21.470 --> 05:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
framework so folks in the field know
