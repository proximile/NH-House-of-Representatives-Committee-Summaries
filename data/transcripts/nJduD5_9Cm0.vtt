00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
okay can you hear me now I turned that
 
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
mic down on the desk here that helps yep
 
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 align:start position:0%
um we've been waiting for our clerk to
 
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
arrive she's not here yet but uh we're
 
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
not supposed to start any of these
 
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
hearings until about 9 15. what I had
 
00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 align:start position:0%
set up when I will read this script at
 
00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 align:start position:0%
that time but for committee members
 
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
I wanted to explain the procedure in
 
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
which we're going to rule through these
 
00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 align:start position:0%
bills today we'd only have three bills
 
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
SB 44 147 and 148. two of those are
 
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
Omnibus bills and when we're looking at
 
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.470 align:start position:0%
Omnibus bills and when we're looking at
that

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
um I think it'd be appropriate that when
 
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
we're going through for example and
 
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
starting on 147 where there are are four
 
00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 align:start position:0%
parts to that bill
 
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
that we will discuss part one and
 
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to testify in part one
 
00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
can do so at that time
 
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
then we'll close down part two one and
 
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
go into part two there that way we won't
 
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
be jumping around through this bill and
 
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
it'll be very difficult for us to and
 
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
for folks that want to testify too to
 
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
listen to other people on this
 
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
particular aspect of the bill
 
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
so if there's no objections from the
 
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
committee I'd like to just take it down
 
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
by the parts uh and the same thing for
 
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
148 where we have five parts there and
 
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
and all the parts are basically within
 
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
the realm of education but they are all
 
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
very very different so
 
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
um it's almost like four bills and one
 
00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
and five bills in the other so let's go
 
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
buy the part and we'll we'll do that
 
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 align:start position:0%
um in the meantime here
 
00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
um I'm working on some of the retained
 
00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 align:start position:0%
bills trying to figure out subcommittee
 
00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 align:start position:0%
work that we'll be doing on retained
 
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
bills we've been given the green light
 
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
to go ahead with uh our subcommittee
 
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
work on retained bills uh following this
 
00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 align:start position:0%
meeting I'm going to sit down here and
 
00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
and try to look at which ones we might
 
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 align:start position:0%
combine and work uh in the in one
 
00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 align:start position:0%
particular subcommittee group and I'll
 
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
get back to members uh on the committee
 
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
in terms of appointing people to the
 
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
various subcommittee uh committees that
 
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to have
 
00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 align:start position:0%
um other than that I know uh we're
 
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 align:start position:0%
basically now waiting for the Senate to
 
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
go through a number of the bills which
 
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
we have submitted to them there was
 
00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 align:start position:0%
hearings yesterday on five lowest bills
 
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
they're working on it so I urge all to
 
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
be looking at the center calendar and
 
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
staying attuned to what is going on here
 
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
so you have the opportunity to
 
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
testify in the Senate
 
00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna wait about seven minutes
 
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
here seven eight minutes before we we
 
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
start at 9 15.
 
00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 align:start position:0%
um I'm waiting also for our clerk to
 
00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.410 align:start position:0%
um I'm waiting also for our clerk to
arrive

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
arrive
 
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.970 align:start position:0%
arrive
so

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
um let's just take a breather get a cup
 
00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 align:start position:0%
of coffee and I know some of you been
 
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
waiting a while as this but uh are there
 
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
is there any other
 
00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 align:start position:0%
um information that anybody on the
 
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
committee would like to ask at this time
 
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
this is kind of like an informal session
 
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
for the first 15 minutes by the way we
 
00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
will not be accepting any bills today
 
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
we will not exact any bills today
 
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I have a question yeah I was
 
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 align:start position:0%
just wondering how uh I am going to
 
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
determine who wants to speak to what
 
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
part of the bill I will explain it when
 
00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
we okay open up every hearing I will
 
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 align:start position:0%
explain how we're going to Wade through
 
00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 align:start position:0%
this so that then the persons that want
 
00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
to speak on part one they can push the
 
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
flag up with their hand up and we can
 
00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
rent okay
 
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
and we'll take them in the order that
 
00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 align:start position:0%
they signed up
 
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
I think that could you promote me
 
00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:51.959 --> 00:04:11.830 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 align:start position:0%

Mr chair yes
 
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
do I remember right on Omnibus bills
 
00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
it's we vote for everything's included
 
00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
we can't say we like them all except
 
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
part three or whatever it's it's
 
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
everything correct when when we look at
 
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
an Omnibus Bill the final product can be
 
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
what we amend to it we can take uh items
 
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
out we can put items in but we have
 
00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 align:start position:0%
different rules in the Senate our our
 
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
additions to any Bill have to be germane
 
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.810 align:start position:0%
additions to any Bill have to be germane
yeah

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
that particular part or that any part of
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
that bill so
 
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
um yes at the final final work if we
 
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
amend anything the whole bill will be
 
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
amended okay
 
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
um to reflect that change because we're
 
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
going to be voting at the end on Senate
 
00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 align:start position:0%

00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
147 today uh there are no parts but one
 
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
yes there are four parts there are four
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
parts wheel type part one and folks that
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
have want to give testimony referencing
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
part one that's when you will have the
 
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity if you also have information
 
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
for us on part two hold that and we will
 
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
discuss that have you present on part
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
two at that time you may have something
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
for three or may not have for three so
 
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
we'll work through it that way that way
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
we will not be jumping around from one
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
part to another part and folks will be
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
able to all hear the questions in the
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
testimony referencing uh specific parts
 
00:19:57.169 --> 00:19:57.179 align:start position:0%
of the bills so with that I'm going to
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
open up the uh hearing for Senate Bill
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
44 this is a bill establishing the New
 
00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:06.299 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Workforce pathway program
 
00:20:09.289 --> 00:20:09.299 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the bill is Senator
 
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
Jay Khan uh I believe Jay may have
 
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
gotten in late from Chicago uh he
 
00:20:18.409 --> 00:20:18.419 align:start position:0%
attended a family activity out there
 
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
over the weekend
 
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
um and I spoke with him and
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
it uh I don't see him and I don't
 
00:20:30.909 --> 00:20:30.919 align:start position:0%
believe we have others that are
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
the administrative assistant for our
 
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
um so uh what I will do is I will
 
00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:42.539 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill simply identifying
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
the bill simply just not getting into
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
the any other rational or content or the
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill and then we'll start
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
taking testimony
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
uh and and Senator Khan asked me to
 
00:20:59.690 --> 00:20:59.700 align:start position:0%
introduce it for him if he's not here so
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
my name is Rick Ladd I am a co-sponsor
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill I come from Haverhill New
 
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here today to
 
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate bill 44. Senate Bill 44
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
is a bill that deals when establishes a
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
Workforce pathway program and Community
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
College system of New Hampshire
 
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to
 
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
um finish my testimony and open this up
 
00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.950 align:start position:0%
um finish my testimony and open this up
to

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:30.059 align:start position:0%
others who may be signed up to testify
 
00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:36.419 align:start position:0%
okay are you ready for that first
 
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
Speaker yes okay first Speaker uh is
 
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:45.850 align:start position:0%
Speaker yes okay first Speaker uh is
Anne-Marie

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:45.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay great can you hear me
 
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
yeah oh perfect
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
um so my name is Ian Ray Banfield I'm an
 
00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:00.539 align:start position:0%
advocate for parental rights and
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
academic excellence in education I come
 
00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
here in opposition of SB 44. I was not
 
00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
able to testify an sb44 when it was
 
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
introduced in the Senate but since then
 
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
I have given this a lot of thought and
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
uh looked over the bill closely and have
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
decided to speak before the house
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
education committee
 
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
roughly 20 years ago the federal
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
government pushed the school to work
 
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.909 align:start position:0%
government pushed the school to work
initiative

00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
it was considered a fad at that time and
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
quickly dissolved because it didn't have
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
anything to do with students natural
 
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
desires or what their parents wanted for
 
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.390 align:start position:0%
desires or what their parents wanted for
them

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
it had to do with focusing on the needs
 
00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:39.539 align:start position:0%
of the employers and providing them
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
labor students would be tracked into the
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
vocation that the government determined
 
00:22:47.169 --> 00:22:47.179 align:start position:0%
was essential for employers that's not
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
student-centered focused
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
those of you who are familiar with Mark
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
Tucker knows that he spelled all of this
 
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
out in his famous letter to Hillary
 
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
Clinton during the Clinton presidency
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
Tucker's Vision was for public schools
 
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
to become a development resource system
 
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
for employers and he continues that
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
mission today
 
00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:09.419 align:start position:0%
so they came up with student learning
 
00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
Pathways that would be developed for
 
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:13.740 align:start position:0%
career Pathways early on until students
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
graduated from high school and into
 
00:23:18.409 --> 00:23:18.419 align:start position:0%
college and Beyond
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
so Texas law today for instance requires
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
students to choose a pathway in seventh
 
00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:23.750 align:start position:0%
students to choose a pathway in seventh
grade

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
grade
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
did you know what you wanted to do in
 
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
seventh grade
 
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:28.820 align:start position:0%
this is tied to the Common Core National
 
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
Standards Initiative which is a
 
00:23:33.649 --> 00:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development model in education
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
the model is not focused on academic
 
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
outcomes or literacy but Workforce
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
training and skills
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
and the 1991 report the secretary's
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
Commission on achieving necessary skills
 
00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:48.059 align:start position:0%
helped change the direction of the
 
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
nation's schools from knowledge-based
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
academic content into an education
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
philosophy where the emphasis is on
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
emotions opinions beliefs and with an
 
00:24:00.409 --> 00:24:00.419 align:start position:0%
emphasis on workplace competencies when
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
competency-based education was
 
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
introduced to this committee I sat in on
 
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
those hearings and opposed the
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
legislation requiring CB
 
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
competency-based education
 
00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:12.539 align:start position:0%
to be implemented in all public schools
 
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
and I recall chairman Ladd and I believe
 
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
representative Shah serving on the house
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
education committee at that time there
 
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
was a great deal of discussion over
 
00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:22.280 align:start position:0%
competencies that could measure student
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
dispositions it was clear to me and
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
there would seemed to be consensus among
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives that competencies would
 
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
not be used in a way to measure a
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
student's disposition
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
Democrats and Republicans agreed on us
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
the focus of competencies were to be to
 
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
be used to measure academics and skills
 
00:24:45.529 --> 00:24:45.539 align:start position:0%
skills that would benefit the students
 
00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:48.179 align:start position:0%
as they prog progressed and would help
 
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
them in life like time management and
 
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
collaboration for instance
 
00:24:54.649 --> 00:24:54.659 align:start position:0%
but now we have social emotional
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
competencies that measure dispositions
 
00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:00.299 align:start position:0%
because sb44 requires this program to be
 
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
based on competencies I cannot support
 
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
it without defining competencies as
 
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
academic or limiting competencies to
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
specific skills what will students
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
college students be measured on
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
will it be on their attitudes on
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
political issues will it be on their
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
emotions this program is part of
 
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
attracting students from pre-k to the
 
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
workforce envisioned by unelected
 
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats pushing public education
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
away from Liberal Arts model towards a
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
Workforce training model
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
in addition there are no Provisions to
 
00:25:35.289 --> 00:25:35.299 align:start position:0%
protecting student privacy and sb44
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
competencies are now shared with
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
colleges when students apply high school
 
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.269 align:start position:0%
colleges when students apply high school
students

00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
sb44 makes no provision for consent by
 
00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
the student to share competencies with
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
another institution or a future employer
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
I listen to a conversation between the
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and CTE
 
00:25:57.169 --> 00:25:57.179 align:start position:0%
coordinators coordinators around New
 
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire roughly probably about a year
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
and a half ago
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
one coordinator talked about how to get
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
more students into the service industry
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
because that's where the jobs are that
 
00:26:09.649 --> 00:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
is not a focus on what is best for
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
students that is a focus on what is best
 
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
for employers if students are choosing
 
00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
career paths based on the needs of
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
employers what does that look like long
 
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
term what happens if their chosen career
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
becomes obsolete
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
there was even a discussion on how long
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
the students stay in these jobs someone
 
00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:33.419 align:start position:0%
suggested that some don't stay past one
 
00:26:33.419 --> 00:26:34.750 align:start position:0%
suggested that some don't stay past one
year

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
when SB within sb44 the language
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
indicates that the purpose is to focus
 
00:26:44.049 --> 00:26:44.059 align:start position:0%
on meeting the needs of the business
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
that is not student focused that is in
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
section 2
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
um part A if you look at the if you look
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
at the language
 
00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:57.059 align:start position:0%
in another section it says that there's
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
no cost to participants well that's
 
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
because this is will be paid for by
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
federal tax dollars what happens when
 
00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
the federal feds cut the funding who
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:12.419 align:start position:0%
um in the notes from the Senate hearing
 
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley expressed concern for
 
00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:18.299 align:start position:0%
federal funding ending uh Dr Susan
 
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
whoard Chancellor for the community
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
college system responded but did not
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
provide a definitive statement on when
 
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
those funds would expire and who would
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
be in charge of replacing that funding
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
she mentioned that the that currently
 
00:27:35.649 --> 00:27:35.659 align:start position:0%
crrsa would be used to provide funding
 
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
crrsa funding is based on emergency
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
funding due to the pandemic at some
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
point that funding will most likely end
 
00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
and who is Le and we are left to spec
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
speculate on who will be left to pick up
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
um chancellor who had also said that
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
there would be adequate funding for at
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
least the next few years but again that
 
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
we are left to speculate
 
00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:06.059 align:start position:0%
within sb44 it also talks about this is
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
that the resources will come from
 
00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
federal the federal Workforce
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity investment Act
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
we can no longer rely on FERPA to re to
 
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
protect personal Privacy Information due
 
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
to the regulatory changes
 
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
how a student personally identified
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
information be shared with the federal
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
government how will they then share this
 
00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:33.059 align:start position:0%
information for instance in FERPA to
 
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
assist research studies allows
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
non-consensual redisclosure disclosure
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
of personally identified
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
identifiable information that was
 
00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:45.059 align:start position:0%
provided by certain educational agencies
 
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
and institutions to other such agencies
 
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
and institutions the lack of privacy
 
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
Protections in this legislation needs to
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
be scrutinized since competencies now
 
00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
expand into measuring attitudes and
 
00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:00.419 align:start position:0%
values how will these competencies be
 
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
shared will future employers now have
 
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
access in addition to to the certificate
 
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:09.299 align:start position:0%
awarded the U.S Department of Education
 
00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
can now share information with the
 
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor due to the
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
regulatory changes in FERPA
 
00:29:18.649 --> 00:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in this legislation
 
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
that directs the Community College to
 
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
require students to review and consent
 
00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
for the release of all competencies that
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
will be shared if they apply to another
 
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
I will send you a copy of a letter that
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
was said to the United States Department
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
of Education sharing serious concerns
 
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
regarding the proposed rule changes to
 
00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
FERPA this letter was signed by the
 
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
executive director from the American
 
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
Association of Collegiate Collegiate
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
registrars and admission officers the
 
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
letter was sent
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
and because of the alarming changes to
 
00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.990 align:start position:0%
and because of the alarming changes to
FERPA

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
FERPA
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
and it highlights the Nullification of
 
00:30:03.169 --> 00:30:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.529 --> 00:30:06.539 align:start position:0%
they go on to say they say this
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
in reviewing the regulatory changes
 
00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:10.140 align:start position:0%
proposed by the department we are
 
00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
alarmed by several striking factors
 
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
first the proposed changes represent a
 
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
wholesale repudiation of fair
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
information practices well-settled
 
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:21.740 align:start position:0%
principles of notice consent access
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
participation data minimization and data
 
00:30:27.649 --> 00:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
retention all undermined by the Paradigm
 
00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
Shift promoted by this proposal
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
um in in order to get through this
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
quickly I will allow you to read the
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
rest of it I will send that to you and
 
00:30:39.889 --> 00:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
not belabor that point but that is uh
 
00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
um the lack of language addressed
 
00:30:48.169 --> 00:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
addressing is the need to protect these
 
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
kinds of data should prevent anyone from
 
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
from supporting this legislation I would
 
00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
certainly encourage you to read their
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
letter this is from the college
 
00:31:00.889 --> 00:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
system itself
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
in addition according to Senate notes
 
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
from sb44 Senator French suggested a
 
00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
sense that Provisions since the sponsor
 
00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
Senator Khan mentioned that this type of
 
00:31:12.409 --> 00:31:12.419 align:start position:0%
training is needed during the covet
 
00:31:15.409 --> 00:31:15.419 align:start position:0%
pandemic when federal funds run out who
 
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
picks up the tab a sunset Amendment
 
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
seems like a logical
 
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
Chancellor Howard also mentioned the
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
potential to move to to the use of
 
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
digital badges
 
00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:33.299 align:start position:0%
these are digital badges that will
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
eventually replace competencies again
 
00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
nothing about protecting the privacy of
 
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
the students digital badges or consent
 
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
to release the information
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
has anyone looked to see if these
 
00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
certificates would qualify a student for
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
a transfer to a university or college
 
00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in a language that
 
00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
includes any follow-up with employers to
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
see if the graduates are properly
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
trained for the money that we are about
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
to spend on training them
 
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
nothing in the language indicates that
 
00:32:03.409 --> 00:32:03.419 align:start position:0%
this program will be analyzed in any way
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
for Effectiveness it will be federal
 
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
dollars but that is still taxpayer
 
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
funding at some point State funds could
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
be required
 
00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
finally I'm just about done finally
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
votech and trade schools have been
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
available in the past for students who
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
want to seek an alternative pathway they
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
were chosen by students with a focus on
 
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
what is best for that student that's how
 
00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
we go back to a student-centered focus
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
this lessens the chance of spending
 
00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
money on a vocation that they may walk
 
00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
away from from after a short time after
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
completing it
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
when a government program is funded by
 
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
the government and focused on the needs
 
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
of the business how long will these
 
00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
graduates continue in their chosen
 
00:32:45.899 --> 00:32:46.970 align:start position:0%
graduates continue in their chosen
profession

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
profession
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
should there be skill in the game by
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
those utilizing this program so they are
 
00:32:54.409 --> 00:32:54.419 align:start position:0%
more likely to take it seriously when
 
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
education institutions become a vehicle
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
for employers will they lose the focus
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
on what is best for the student from the
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
discussion with the CTE coordinators
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
that is a definite possibility while
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
employers can certainly be a a resource
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
this redesign in public education is a
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
complete paradigm shift to a Workforce
 
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
Workforce model
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
this is part of that model this program
 
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
is another step towards the Seamless Web
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
envisioned by Mark Tucker it is similar
 
00:33:27.409 --> 00:33:27.419 align:start position:0%
to track it to the tracking system in
 
00:33:29.389 --> 00:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
European countries and it should be
 
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.019 align:start position:0%
noted that you won't see students
 
00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:32.519 align:start position:0%
finishing at the top on International
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
tests in math and science in those
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
countries I would suggest that this
 
00:33:39.889 --> 00:33:39.899 align:start position:0%
legislation be turned into a study
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
committee where all of this can be
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
discussed and more is this what New
 
00:33:45.769 --> 00:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents want for their
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
children or is this a vision of Mark
 
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
Tucker who who most New Hampshire people
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even be able to recognize job
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
preparation is important for sure but
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
that cannot come at the expense of
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
literacy and it cannot come at the
 
00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:01.019 align:start position:0%
expense of looking out for the
 
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
well-being of the students in our
 
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
education system so for these reasons I
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote itl and sb44 thank you
 
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Miss Banfield are
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
you willing to take any questions
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
if you have time I suppose yes
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%

00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands up thank you very
 
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.089 --> 00:34:38.099 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead miss you welcome
 
00:34:38.099 --> 00:34:43.129 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead miss you welcome
Chancellor

00:34:43.129 --> 00:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:45.419 align:start position:0%
are you there you
 
00:34:46.609 --> 00:34:46.619 align:start position:0%
can muted
 
00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
I am I am thank you representative black
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone I'm here to speak
 
00:34:55.369 --> 00:34:55.379 align:start position:0%
uh in support of SB 44 establishing the
 
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Workforce pathway program
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
when Senator Khan and other folks
 
00:35:01.609 --> 00:35:01.619 align:start position:0%
created this it is modeled after a very
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
successful program in the state of
 
00:35:03.359 --> 00:35:05.089 align:start position:0%
successful program in the state of
Virginia

00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:05.099 align:start position:0%
Virginia
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
and I thought I would address a few of
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
the questions that have come up uh
 
00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:11.780 align:start position:0%
during the Senate phase of the bill
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
which ultimately passed uh the first
 
00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:17.099 align:start position:0%
question was is this also a request for
 
00:35:17.099 --> 00:35:18.170 align:start position:0%
question was is this also a request for
funding

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
while in the original Bill there was
 
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
some suggestions about finding the
 
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
current bill this is not a request for
 
00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:26.339 align:start position:0%
funding because we believe that the
 
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
funding source is already exist uh there
 
00:35:32.569 --> 00:35:32.579 align:start position:0%
as uh the previous speaker mentioned
 
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
wioa funds are available uh there will
 
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
be short-term pal regular Pell which is
 
00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
being increased there are scholarship
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
opportunities from entities like the New
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire automobile dealers and and so
 
00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
on so we think that there is money
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
available for these short-term training
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
programs for in-demand jobs
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about people who have
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
already been graduated from high school
 
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
and are in the workforce or just
 
00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
entering the workforce this is entirely
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
about short-term training as a launch
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
pad for the next step that an individual
 
00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
may wish to take
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
you might have the question of you know
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
since there are organizations that
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
already do this is the bill really
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
needed one of the challenges is in fact
 
00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
the the silos that exist within our
 
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.829 align:start position:0%
the the silos that exist within our
government

00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
and various non-profits including our
 
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
colleges and so our interest in this
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
particular commission is that all of us
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
will sit in one room
 
00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
and that you know oftentimes a
 
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
commission is what causes the parties to
 
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
focus around the table for the community
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
college system there are many
 
00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
opportunities that are coming under the
 
00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
Biden Administration in terms of Grants
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
uh at one point in New Hampshire's
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
history we were very attractive to
 
00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
Grants because we were seen as a
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
prototype for the largest states well
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
that has changed and now we frequently
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
lose out on grant opportunities to
 
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
larger entities like Florida and Texas
 
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
and California
 
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
one of the ways for us to indicate to
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
these grantors
 
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
our interest is to have all of us
 
00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
together in a commission and to be able
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
to cite within our applications that
 
00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
everyone that has something to do with
 
00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:26.940 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development is sitting in the
 
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
um I thank you again for your
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
consideration of sb44 I'd be happy to
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you might have
 
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Chancellor are there
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
questions for Susan Huard yes
 
00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you thank
 
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:51.550 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you thank
you

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
getting everybody together because there
 
00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
is no permission but I see in this
 
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh legislation so I'm wondering what
 
00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
mission you are
 
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
um referring to
 
00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps I'm using the wrong word by
 
00:38:11.329 --> 00:38:11.339 align:start position:0%
uh describing it as a commission but a a
 
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:16.140 align:start position:0%
a a group wherein we have members of
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
various state agencies uh and members of
 
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
various non-profits including the
 
00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:22.820 align:start position:0%
Community College sitting together
 
00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
discussing the workforce needs of the
 
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
state and the opportunities for
 
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.140 align:start position:0%
short-term funding for those
 
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.450 align:start position:0%
short-term funding for those
bills

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
00:38:38.329 --> 00:38:38.339 align:start position:0%
for yes representative luno thank you
 
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair and thank you
 
00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
Chancellor for uh for joining us this
 
00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.010 align:start position:0%
Chancellor for uh for joining us this
morning

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if you could talk
 
00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
with us just a little bit about
 
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
um how uh Pell Grants might be
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
applicable to
 
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.190 align:start position:0%
applicable to
um

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
um uh to for folks that may be taking
 
00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
less than a full-time
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know course load in order to get
 
00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
a uh you know a high value credential
 
00:39:05.089 --> 00:39:05.099 align:start position:0%
built you know build a high value
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
credential sure thank you for the
 
00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
question representative currently
 
00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
um students who are PAL eligible can
 
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
either attend as full-time students or
 
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
as part-time students but those funds
 
00:39:19.329 --> 00:39:19.339 align:start position:0%
right now are directed towards
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
certificates that are at least 16
 
00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:25.619 align:start position:0%
college credits or more or full-fledged
 
00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
degrees such as the associate degrees
 
00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
offered by the community college system
 
00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
what the government is currently
 
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
contemplating they've completed a pilot
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
on funding for short-term training
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
programs so these would be things that
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
are less than six months and are not
 
00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily credit bearing so as that
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
moves from Pilot stage to full-fledged
 
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
implementation will have an opportunity
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
to help students and residents to um
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
fund their you know participation in for
 
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
example L A programs basic automotive
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
technician uh there are in other states
 
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
opportunities for people who are in the
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
information technology area to become
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
coders with short programs so it's
 
00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
funding that has not been available and
 
00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:20.839 align:start position:0%
is very likely to be available shortly
 
00:40:23.089 --> 00:40:23.099 align:start position:0%
thank you that's that's excellent
 
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
Chancellor thanks very much very good
 
00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
news representative
 
00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
Chancellor for being with us this
 
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
morning so my understanding is is that
 
00:40:40.329 --> 00:40:40.339 align:start position:0%
this uh bill would try to identify
 
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
short-term opportunities for individuals
 
00:40:46.609 --> 00:40:46.619 align:start position:0%
to get certificates this is not focused
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily on a degree program but more
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
a certificate program that an individual
 
00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
may say I might want to do this based
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
upon my current uh personal situation to
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
try to advance myself into the workforce
 
00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes uh representative
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
Miler that's absolutely correct this is
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
in fact not aimed at all at degrees and
 
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
in terms of certificates it is only
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
aimed at short-term certificates so for
 
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
example this is not aimed at people who
 
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
might want to be a licensed practical
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
nurses but it is aimed at helping people
 
00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
who would like to take the very first
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
step as an LNA to help them fund what is
 
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
a couple thousand dollars whether they
 
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
come through the community college
 
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
system or some of the private nonprofits
 
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
that also run those programs so this is
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
that first step
 
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
um when the bill was being conceived we
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
were thinking about the people who have
 
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
been unemployed particularly those in
 
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
retail industries that and in
 
00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
Hospitality that have lost their
 
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
positions in conversations with
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
individuals we hear that they would like
 
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
to look at other fields where perhaps
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
the you know the the employee women is
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
more secure so this is a help to them to
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
move them into that very first step and
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
obviously from our point of view we hope
 
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
that they will move through certificates
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
and degrees not only with us but also at
 
00:42:20.569 --> 00:42:20.579 align:start position:0%
the Baccalaureate level
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification thank
 
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
you sir
 
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative woodcock
 
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Chancellor thank
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
you so much for uh explaining more about
 
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
this this bill much appreciated I just
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh my question
 
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
uh deals specifically with law
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
enforcement is there any chance that the
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
Community College will be working with
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
them in terms of uh preparation as we
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
know many of the police forces around
 
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
the state currently have vacancies and
 
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
and uh I didn't know helping students
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
prepare for the criminal justice program
 
00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
or work activity
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
um well representative that hasn't I
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
haven't heard anything about that yet
 
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
but we tend to uh you know follow where
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
the employment needs are and if that is
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
an area uh we certainly have several uh
 
00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:11.099 align:start position:0%
colleges that have uh criminal justice
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
programs and working with them to
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
identify what the preliminary skill set
 
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
could be that is something I could
 
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
easily take to the various advisory
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
committees to see uh what we could
 
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
figure out uh one of the things that we
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
have spoken about is the community
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
college system is uh
 
00:43:35.329 --> 00:43:35.339 align:start position:0%
is beginning to use badges
 
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:38.220 align:start position:0%
um and these are something that an
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
individual can choose to display on his
 
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
or her resume but what a badges is it
 
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
says that you've you've got this
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
particular set of skills it may be in
 
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
working with law enforcement that we can
 
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
identify a specific set of skills that
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
would lead to that first job so we
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
certainly would be interested
 
00:43:59.690 --> 00:43:59.700 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so much for your
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
response and thank you for taking the
 
00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
time to speak with us today thank you
 
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
rep sound like
 
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you uh
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
Chancellor for taking the question
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
um my question just concerns who is
 
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
eligible for this program according to
 
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill it's the uh
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
unemployed and underemployed New
 
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire adults and then more
 
00:44:23.329 --> 00:44:23.339 align:start position:0%
specifically the pathway program shall
 
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
provide training to furloughed laid off
 
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
dislocated underserved or other
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
populations affected by covet 19. so is
 
00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
this a limited program limited to those
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
populations because I'm sort of hearing
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
there seems almost like this assumption
 
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
that anybody can apply for this but
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's my reading of the bill is that's
 
00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:44.420 align:start position:0%
not the case at all
 
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:47.329 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
um

00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:47.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
you know we always try to include uh
 
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
people who are interested so while this
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
this bill is specifically aimed at the
 
00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
underemployed and the unemployed on
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
account of covid and frankly that's the
 
00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
way some of the uh grants that we expect
 
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for is worded those are
 
00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
the primary people we would serve but uh
 
00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
we always leave the door open a little
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
bit for other folks but they are not the
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
primary audience the primary audience is
 
00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
exactly as you've described them sir
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh Chancellor heward
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you just trying to
 
00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:29.220 align:start position:0%
understand uh some of the wording in the
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
bill a little bit
 
00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
um currently within the Department of
 
00:45:35.329 --> 00:45:35.339 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs the office
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
of Workforce opportunity works with
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
programs and partners to provide these
 
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce training opportunities and
 
00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
training that we're talking about I
 
00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:47.780 align:start position:0%
understand within the combined state
 
00:45:50.809 --> 00:45:50.819 align:start position:0%
plan the community college system is
 
00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
currently a member that apartment that
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
works towards this endeavor
 
00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
um then in looking at the bill in Romans
 
00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
3 at the very base of the bill bill just
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
before the effective date
 
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
it says
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
um partner with the Department of
 
00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:09.660 align:start position:0%
Employment Security Department of
 
00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
Economic Affairs director of Workforce
 
00:46:13.609 --> 00:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
Development and Career Technical
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
education centers
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
how is this bill going to be more
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
effective than the present format that
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
we have here in the state through the
 
00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:25.859 align:start position:0%
Department of Business and economic
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
Affairs going to improve our preparation
 
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
of these people and need to be retooled
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
or trained in another another field
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ladd I guess I
 
00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
would say that
 
00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
um what's called for in this bill would
 
00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
enhance the pre-existing
 
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.809 align:start position:0%
enhance the pre-existing
organizations

00:46:47.809 --> 00:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
um my understanding of the office of
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce opportunity and and their
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
um management of wioa there are only
 
00:46:59.809 --> 00:46:59.819 align:start position:0%
specific uh certificates that qualify
 
00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
for wioa but there are other
 
00:47:02.599 --> 00:47:04.990 align:start position:0%
for wioa but there are other
possibilities

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
possibilities
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
that we would like to explore so I my
 
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
short answer is that this broadens the
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
work and and includes more entities than
 
00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
that which is specified in wioa
 
00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:26.220 align:start position:0%
for the chancellor

00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:38.819 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:41.099 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just wondering if that is a
 
00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
system developed by the community
 
00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:45.380 align:start position:0%
college system or if you're using a
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
third-party vendor for that
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
um and maybe any additional information
 
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:54.020 align:start position:0%
you could provide to this uh committee
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
or especially myself I would appreciate
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry representative are you
 
00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
saying digital badging I I can't quite
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
hear you oh okay all right
 
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
um so additional information
 
00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:13.550 align:start position:0%
um so additional information
um

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
we have uh a committee across College
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
committee that's working on this we have
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
um adopted a a badging product called
 
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
badger in fact
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
um a few weeks ago president Larissa
 
00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:31.700 align:start position:0%
baia from Lakes Region Community College
 
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
announced the first badge
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
um and that is being awarded to a people
 
00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
uh working in restaurants
 
00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:43.140 align:start position:0%
um there was a short-term training
 
00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
program that was developed between the
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
Restaurant Association and three of our
 
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
community colleges White Mountains Lakes
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
Region and I believe the third one was
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
Nashua and
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
um in in working with these individuals
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
put together
 
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of a safety certification
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
so that people were behaving
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately in terms of food handling
 
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
and and treatment of guests and so on we
 
00:49:14.809 --> 00:49:14.819 align:start position:0%
worked with the common man restaurants
 
00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:16.460 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
and batching is a way of capturing a
 
00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:25.859 align:start position:0%
particular set of skills and they're
 
00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
actually embedded in the badge itself so
 
00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
that individuals can post this on their
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
resume if they so choose as they're
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
looking for future employment
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
this is a relatively new activity for us
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at whether this
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
translates in any way into college
 
00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
credit we think likely some of them will
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
and we need to as an organization build
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
a structure around that but at this
 
00:49:59.690 --> 00:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
moment the community college system is
 
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
working on badging within our Workforce
 
00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
training and non-credit area I can
 
00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
certainly send you more information
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
about the product that we are using I
 
00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:14.220 align:start position:0%
would also say that the universe city of
 
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in their extension
 
00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:21.140 align:start position:0%
program has also begun to issue badges
 
00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:24.980 align:start position:0%
as a way of collecting information
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
we are I guess we're kind of in the
 
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
middle of this effort other states are
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
certainly ahead of us in fact this
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
original badge that we came up with was
 
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
based on conversations that I had with
 
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
colleagues in Texas who had put together
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
a similar program and began to speak
 
00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
with us about the value to individuals
 
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:55.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
Chancellor I have one further question
 
00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.010 align:start position:0%
Chancellor I have one further question
um

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:00.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
the the program that's being recommended
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
in SBE 44 is going to be coordinated
 
00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:07.980 align:start position:0%
with various types of programs like
 
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Employment Security what
 
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
is the meaning of Education agencies are
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
you talking about the Department of
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
Education seeing we're also referencing
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
prayer technical education I'm just
 
00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out where the
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education comes into play
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
I I suspect it would be on the CTE side
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
of things representative lad uh we were
 
00:51:34.609 --> 00:51:34.619 align:start position:0%
not envisioning something larger uh such
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
as that which was uh described by the
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
previous speaker there are some uh
 
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
comprehensive high schools that have
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
spoken with us about what kind of
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
activity could happen this summer after
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
graduation so I do anticipate that we
 
00:51:55.329 --> 00:51:55.339 align:start position:0%
may have conversations with
 
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
Comprehensive high schools that are
 
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
interested in addition to the ctes
 
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
um I I honestly don't expect that that's
 
00:52:04.849 --> 00:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
the large part of this audience though
 
00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
we expect that it is unemployed people
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
dislocated people under employed people
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
that are the uh the focus at this point
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh are there further
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
questions for Chancellor here
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
not see any hands up thank you very much
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you sir I appreciate the help and
 
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
I do hope that you will vote to pass SB
 
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:39.130 align:start position:0%
 
Carpenter

00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:39.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:40.670 align:start position:0%
 
endless

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
endless
 
00:52:44.809 --> 00:52:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes we can okay thank
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:52:58.990 --> 00:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm also here to speak uh in favor of
 
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
sb44 I am the program director for a
 
00:53:05.809 --> 00:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
grant funded program called New
 
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs caregivers it's funded
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
through civil monetary penalty funds to
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
recruit and train 700 licensed nursing
 
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
assistants to work in New Hampshire
 
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
over the past year of my program New
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs caregivers I've had over
 
00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:30.140 align:start position:0%
700 individuals reach out to me
 
00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:33.140 align:start position:0%
interested in a career in health care
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
specifically as a licensed nursing
 
00:53:36.599 --> 00:53:38.049 align:start position:0%
specifically as a licensed nursing
assistant

00:53:38.049 --> 00:53:38.059 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
there's a great desire for a career in
 
00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
health care
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
the barriers right now include access to
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
training in different locations of the
 
00:53:50.809 --> 00:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
state and also access to financial
 
00:53:50.819 --> 00:53:52.609 align:start position:0%
state and also access to financial
resources

00:53:52.609 --> 00:53:52.619 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
I've also found that individuals looking
 
00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
to start a career in healthcare need
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
some coaching and support and I'm sure
 
00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
as you all know or have heard numerous
 
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
times probably there is certainly a need
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
for additional caregivers in New
 
00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have an aging population
 
00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:17.660 align:start position:0%
the average age of our nursing staff is
 
00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
approaching retirement age so we
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
certainly need more entry-level workers
 
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
I'm reiterating the statement that made
 
00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
by Chancellor heward the benefits to
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
sb44 really are to reduce the silos and
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
establish a program for collaboration to
 
00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
develop a Workforce strategy to define
 
00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
the issues and develop meaningful and
 
00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
effective actions to meet the workforce
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
needs of the state
 
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
personally I worked as a nursing home
 
00:54:56.170 --> 00:54:56.180 align:start position:0%
administrator for over 20 years
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
retiring from that career about a year
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
ago and I can tell you in my own
 
00:55:04.609 --> 00:55:04.619 align:start position:0%
experience there's always been a need
 
00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:07.980 align:start position:0%
for for caregivers I've also worked with
 
00:55:11.809 --> 00:55:11.819 align:start position:0%
several entry-level caregivers who
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
really want opportunities for growth and
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
for those reasons I ask that you vote in
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
favor of sb44
 
00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Miss Carpenter are
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%

00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
are New Hampshire's Statewide Chamber of
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
Commerce we are here in support of SB 44
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
and my purpose is to convey to the
 
00:56:25.609 --> 00:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
committee the uh critical urgency of
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
Workforce needs with employers across
 
00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:29.339 align:start position:0%
the state and I have to confess even
 
00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
though I work on economic development
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
and Workforce Development issues it came
 
00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
as a little bit of a surprise to me
 
00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:40.380 align:start position:0%
um we over the past week several weeks
 
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
have been begun hearing from employers
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
from all sectors of the economy on their
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
difficulty in finding a Workforce and I
 
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
say it took me a little bit by surprise
 
00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
because obviously we're still in the
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
middle of the uh coronavirus pandemic
 
00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
and employers went a year ago from being
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
concerned about Workforce to being
 
00:57:03.849 --> 00:57:03.859 align:start position:0%
concerned about staying in business
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
but that has changed dramatically and we
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
know that the state's unemployment rate
 
00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:14.420 align:start position:0%
is uh approaching pre-pandemic uh
 
00:57:16.609 --> 00:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
unemployment which was among the lowest
 
00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
in the nation and we are hearing from
 
00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
our members uh that that uh Workforce is
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
again becoming their most critical issue
 
00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.609 align:start position:0%
again becoming their most critical issue
so

00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
um I would encourage the committee to
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
look favorably on this bill it will
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
assist in programs that already are
 
00:57:39.049 --> 00:57:39.059 align:start position:0%
happening in the state like these sector
 
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and the programs through
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
the office of business and economic
 
00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:44.690 align:start position:0%
the office of business and economic
Affairs

00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
Affairs
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
um referred to by the previous
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
speakers uh this will better prepare
 
00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
those who are unemployed and
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
underemployed for the types of jobs that
 
00:57:58.370 --> 00:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
are readily available right now in New
 
00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and
 
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
um frankly unlike a lot of legislation I
 
00:58:04.849 --> 00:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
see no negatives with this one but only
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
positive so thank you Mr chair members
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'd be happy to answer
 
00:58:11.089 --> 00:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you very much Mr
 
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
jubay I'm sorry for butchering your your
 
00:58:15.609 --> 00:58:15.619 align:start position:0%
last name
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's not the first time that's ever
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
happened Mr chair okay thank you uh are
 
00:58:25.609 --> 00:58:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
thanks very much Mr chair and thanks uh
 
00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
Mr Juve for uh joining us this morning
 
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of quick questions uh
 
00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
just wondering what um um what
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
organization develops the um the sort of
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
the is there a list of um of critical
 
00:58:48.049 --> 00:58:48.059 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage areas or Workforce
 
00:58:48.059 --> 00:58:49.609 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage areas or Workforce
needs

00:58:49.609 --> 00:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh that's an excellent question uh
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative Luna so thanks for
 
00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
answering I can only respond based on
 
00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing from our members and I
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
should say the Bia covers a wide
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
spectrum of uh businesses and you know
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
covering all areas of the economy we are
 
00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
we have less members in the retail
 
00:59:16.849 --> 00:59:16.859 align:start position:0%
sector the auto dealerships and
 
00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:19.140 align:start position:0%
restaurants especially because they have
 
00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
their own associations and do a great
 
00:59:24.109 --> 00:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
job but we cover uh manufacturing
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
business services financial services and
 
00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
we run the gamut uh use utilities Public
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
Utilities we run the gamut from the
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
state's largest companies down to sole
 
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
Proprietors so I can only tell you what
 
00:59:38.809 --> 00:59:38.819 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing and what I'm hearing right
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
now is especially coming from the
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing sector where they are
 
00:59:47.329 --> 00:59:47.339 align:start position:0%
finding it almost impossible to fill
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
open positions let alone find people
 
00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
that are well qualified
 
00:59:56.089 --> 00:59:56.099 align:start position:0%
so and a follow-up on that Mr chair
 
00:59:59.089 --> 00:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
so um so thanks and and so the the
 
01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:01.799 align:start position:0%
follow-up question really is really sort
 
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
of focuses in on the manufacturing
 
01:00:08.089 --> 01:00:08.099 align:start position:0%
sector but uh but it it it's it's really
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
it's I I think this has been developing
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
for several years now in this you know
 
01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:17.339 align:start position:0%
acute Workforce shortage uh issue is um
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know tends to be a double-edged
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
sword when it comes to Workforce
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
training as well because it means
 
01:00:26.329 --> 01:00:26.339 align:start position:0%
there's fewer people uh available
 
01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
um let's say for instance at the
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
community college level to um to staff
 
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
these these courses in um you know
 
01:00:37.609 --> 01:00:37.619 align:start position:0%
whether it's engineering technology and
 
01:00:40.609 --> 01:00:40.619 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if if maybe uh Senate
 
01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:43.140 align:start position:0%
Bill might Senate Bill 44 if it doesn't
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
already could could help to um
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
um extend the Partnerships between the
 
01:00:54.049 --> 01:00:54.059 align:start position:0%
the private sector and the and for
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
example the community college system to
 
01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that um
 
01:01:02.329 --> 01:01:02.339 align:start position:0%
that the community colleges are staffed
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately in order to to
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
um you know have instructure instructors
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
to for the curriculum that's uh that's
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
really necessary uh to meet the
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
workforce needs yeah representative Lino
 
01:01:21.049 --> 01:01:21.059 align:start position:0%
I think those connections exist but I
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
think Senate Bill 44 will strengthen and
 
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
expand those connections I would say
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the positions that are
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
open now in manufacturing
 
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure there are some that are
 
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
highly technical but many of these
 
01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
positions are those that are considered
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
entry level and so what what employers
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
are looking for is people with basic
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
computer skills and literacy skills I I
 
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
was I guess a little amused by a
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
previous testifier saying that literacy
 
01:01:53.809 --> 01:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
and I'm paraphrasing but literacy you
 
01:01:56.329 --> 01:01:56.339 align:start position:0%
know wasn't important to employers and I
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
I just was somewhat mystified by that
 
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
because that's a basic competency that
 
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
any employer is looking for so
 
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
um the direct anterior question is I
 
01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
think those connections exist but I
 
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
think Senate Bill 44 will be very
 
01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
helpful in strengthening and expanding
 
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
those connections great fantastic thank
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
you David
 
01:02:18.049 --> 01:02:18.059 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh Mr duvet further
 
01:02:18.059 --> 01:02:20.270 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh Mr duvet further
questions

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
representative Leon uh thank you Mr
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Mr Juve for taking
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
the question I have been speaking with
 
01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
Employers in my area and a lot of their
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
needs are actually based on people not
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
wanting to go back to work because
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
they're receiving stimulus funds and
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
other funds that that mean that they
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
don't actually have to re-enter the
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
workforce is that something you've
 
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
spoken to uh members of the Bia and have
 
01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:44.940 align:start position:0%
you seen how much that's impacting them
 
01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
versus training issues yeah this is a a
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
little off topic but I would like to
 
01:02:54.049 --> 01:02:54.059 align:start position:0%
respond Mr chair with your permission
 
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
um there are uh those in our membership
 
01:02:59.890 --> 01:02:59.900 align:start position:0%
who are concerned about that issue
 
01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
they're also concerned about because of
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
covid-19 there was a waiver of the job
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
search requirement and that waiver
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
exists to this day the Bia this week
 
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
sent a letter to the governor urge and
 
01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
to legislative leadership urging that
 
01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
they rescind that waiver and and that
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
will help in some ways to get people
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
back to work
 
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
um I I think that's an issue I I don't
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
know that Senate Bill 44 would have a
 
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
direct impact on that but there are
 
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
certainly other issues relating to
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
Workforce that are that are out there
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you very much

01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
sounds like uh you there have been quite
 
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
a few supportive uh Partners to this
 
01:05:19.569 --> 01:05:19.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
uh signed in with their testimony uh
 
01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
I will say that in States like uh
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
Virginia and Utah
 
01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
they began these efforts and they were
 
01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:38.150 align:start position:0%
they began these efforts and they were
excellent

01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:43.670 align:start position:0%
excellent
uh

01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:49.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
yes we can
 
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
all right so the point was
 
01:05:59.569 --> 01:05:59.579 align:start position:0%
uh this kind of uh alignment was
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
valuable when they had a Workforce
 
01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:03.710 align:start position:0%
valuable when they had a Workforce
shortage

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh it then became valuable uh during the
 
01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic as well as more people uh
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
needed to find their way with more
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
employable skills into the openings that
 
01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:20.180 align:start position:0%
existed uh it's just a good vehicle to
 
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
uh put
 
01:06:26.809 --> 01:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
the various pieces together and it
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
includes uh the Bea as a valuable
 
01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
partner because
 
01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
it's important for students who for
 
01:06:38.089 --> 01:06:38.099 align:start position:0%
unemployed and underemployed people to
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
find their way into academic programs
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
but also to find their way to the
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
employers so that they get a vision of
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
what kind of training is going to be
 
01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
once they enter that position in the
 
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
workforce uh and what's a job
 
01:06:54.109 --> 01:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
opportunities for advancement and uh
 
01:06:56.089 --> 01:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
initial starting salaries are going to
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
be and that really is where the
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
businesses come in and play a very
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
strong partnership role whether it's
 
01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
with internships or or recruitment
 
01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.930 align:start position:0%
with internships or or recruitment
information

01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
um and then certainly the Bea plays such
 
01:07:11.089 --> 01:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
an important role in keeping track of
 
01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:13.220 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
labor economy in the state of New
 
01:07:18.589 --> 01:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on a quarterly basis reporting
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh where the job needs are and updating
 
01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
their projections so this the system of
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
alignment it it works uh and I think we
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
have the talent in this state to align
 
01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
our resources uh in a very effective way
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
to assist uh
 
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Senator Khan Senator
 
01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
Khan can you please explain to me and
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:50.420 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about the the the
 
01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
source of funding that comes from the
 
01:07:54.289 --> 01:07:54.299 align:start position:0%
federal Workforce Innovation and
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
Opportunity Act will that now be
 
01:07:58.010 --> 01:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
funneled directly to the Community
 
01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
College or is it still funneled through
 
01:08:03.049 --> 01:08:03.059 align:start position:0%
the business and economic Affairs
 
01:08:03.059 --> 01:08:04.190 align:start position:0%
the business and economic Affairs
Department

01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
Department
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
it absolutely is still with the Bea
 
01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:15.059 align:start position:0%
what uh is a part of the Bea and the Bea
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
has some very good programs established
 
01:08:20.289 --> 01:08:20.299 align:start position:0%
uh like employer-based training programs
 
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
uh which are really important as well as
 
01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:25.739 align:start position:0%
as well as rapid re-employment
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh programs so uh but but I think this
 
01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
is positioning ourselves for new dollars
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
coming into the state of New Hampshire
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
as well uh if you follow uh the current
 
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
federal Administration they do have uh
 
01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
on the drawing boards uh how to use Pell
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
Grants to reduce the cost of certificate
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
programs and Rapid employment through
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%

business does not own them so we help
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
support that
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
um we believe that a homegrown uh local
 
01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
Workforce is Key to Our Success it's why
 
01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
we worked with the colleges and the high
 
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
school ctes for so long
 
01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
um our two-year programs uh two-year
 
01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
degree programs
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
um aren't for every everyone some folks
 
01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
decide early on they want to work on a
 
01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
General Motors car and they wind up in
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
Laconia for two years uh or Honda and
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
they want to be in Nashville and that's
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
what they've committed to but those
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
long-term commitments uh for both the
 
01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.189 align:start position:0%
long-term commitments uh for both the
costs

01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:11:59.930 --> 01:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
um and also just you know interest level
 
01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily there and they don't
 
01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
they don't fit for everyone so the bill
 
01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
that Senator Khan has proposed and that
 
01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
we've supported in the Senate as well
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
we kind of view it as it's an on-ramp
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
into our industry it's a short-term
 
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
offering to allow someone to get some
 
01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
exposure uh to decide whether it's a
 
01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
good fit for them and and and where it's
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
a good fit for them uh some folks may
 
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
have a have a a great interest in cars
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
um and and they're really fascinated
 
01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
with them and it consumes them however
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
they just don't have the mechanical
 
01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
aptitude to be deconstructing and
 
01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
rebuilding them so uh maybe a better fit
 
01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
for them is in the sales uh on the sales
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
force or maybe as a service writer maybe
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
the technician isn't right for them
 
01:12:50.209 --> 01:12:50.219 align:start position:0%
maybe someone has a great interest in
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
business and marketing so they'll be in
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
our finance and insurance office or
 
01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
Business Development Center maybe you're
 
01:12:59.450 --> 01:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
very very organized so supply chain and
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
inventory management is your thing so
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
you find out that you're actually a
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
better fit for the parts department and
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
the wholesale parts business so
 
01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
short-term programs like
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
um Senator Khan and SP 44 has proposed
 
01:13:17.209 --> 01:13:17.219 align:start position:0%
allows this initial exposure to find
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
where and that best fit would be in our
 
01:13:22.729 --> 01:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
industry and that's one of the reasons
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
why we will uh we do in fact support it
 
01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
um we have an immediate need for a
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
variety of Workforce opportunities and
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's not just technicians
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
um we've got a clear need to fill those
 
01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
those vacancies with a a talented and
 
01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
committed and trained Workforce
 
01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
um so that's the reason for our uh
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
support of this particular legislation
 
01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:45.530 align:start position:0%
support of this particular legislation
so

01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
um again in uh in aiming to be brief I
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
want to uh re-echo our support for sp-44
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
hope that the committee can support it
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
um and give it a favorable
 
01:13:58.370 --> 01:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
recommendation and I will um I'll
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
forward over my testimony as mentioned
 
01:14:01.610 --> 01:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
and if possible I'll attempt to answer
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
any questions that you all may have
 
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Bennett are there
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
questions for the Automobile Dealers
 
01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.950 align:start position:0%
questions for the Automobile Dealers
Association

01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
Association
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Bennett um
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
we have in this legislation that the
 
01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
certificate completion has to be done in
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
not more than six months is six months
 
01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
the appropriate time for these types of
 
01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
programs do you need more time or can
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
you do it with six or less months
 
01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the the
 
01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
legislation is based on a successful
 
01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:35.219 align:start position:0%
model out of other states I believe
 
01:14:37.729 --> 01:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
Virginia and Utah and so it has been
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
tested so I would assume that the the
 
01:14:42.050 --> 01:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
sixth is acceptable you know it is
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
designed to be a short-term program so
 
01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
that you can clearly decide do I want to
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
jump in for another two years or a year
 
01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
and a half of schooling do I want to go
 
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
right out into the immediate Workforce
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
um and hope and be trained on the job
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
and have the employer hopefully support
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
it uh possibly through
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
um you know internal training offerings
 
01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
that they may have internal mentorship
 
01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
programs that they may have so my
 
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
understanding is that uh just to get
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
back to it that it is and that six month
 
01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
uh does come from a tried and uh and and
 
01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
tested program in other states so I
 
01:15:17.209 --> 01:15:17.219 align:start position:0%
would assume that that's an appropriate
 
01:15:17.219 --> 01:15:18.050 align:start position:0%
would assume that that's an appropriate
number

01:15:18.050 --> 01:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much further questions
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%

not seeing any answer questions for the
 
01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.590 align:start position:0%
not seeing any answer questions for the
Department

01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%

opposed three
 
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
zero neutral and we were supposed to
 
01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
have set a testify but I believe only
 
01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:20.900 align:start position:0%

go in ahead and enter into Senate field
 
01:17:01.610 --> 01:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
147 at this time this is a bill it's an
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill legislation relative to
 
01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:05.699 align:start position:0%

uh so it's one of those bills which
 
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
we've talked about at the beginning
 
01:17:15.649 --> 01:17:15.659 align:start position:0%
where we're going to take it by Parts
 
01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
we're going to go through the first part
 
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
first and notice that I have
 
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:23.400 align:start position:0%

so I will introduce Senate Bill 147 for
 
01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
him on his behalf I did talk to him
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
earlier several days ago and he asked
 
01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
did I do it if he wasn't here
 
01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:40.140 align:start position:0%

particular he would be doing the Special
 
01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
Olympics part four but he's welcomed as
 
01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
a sponsor of some of this legislation to
 
01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:40.790 align:start position:0%
 
Bradley

01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%

01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to do that
 
01:20:59.090 --> 01:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
um Senator 147 is one of our Omnibus
 
01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:00.530 align:start position:0%
um Senator 147 is one of our Omnibus
bills

01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
um there are four pieces to it
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
um one the first piece deals with
 
01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
federal student aid uh the second piece
 
01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
central registry the third
 
01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
transportation of pupils and my section
 
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
which if I
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
um representative Ladd could testify to
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
deals with uh special education costs in
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
small communities
 
01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
so why don't you Jeff go ahead and
 
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
present your section so you can get on
 
01:21:34.669 --> 01:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
to work yourself then we'll hop back to
 
01:21:36.890 --> 01:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
section one yeah that would be lovely
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
because I'm trying to chair uh Senate
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services at the same
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
time so thank you very much so
 
01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.610 align:start position:0%
time so thank you very much so
um

01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
I introduced uh part four of Senate Bill
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
147 because of what happened in one of
 
01:21:57.770 --> 01:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
the very small towns in Carroll County
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
Parts location which I think uh
 
01:22:03.530 --> 01:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli is very familiar
 
01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:04.669 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli is very familiar
with

01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
um in Hearts location there was a
 
01:22:10.010 --> 01:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
apparently a family that moved into the
 
01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:11.290 align:start position:0%
apparently a family that moved into the
community

01:22:11.290 --> 01:22:11.300 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
obviously qualified for special
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
education services but it was very
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
expensive and given that
 
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
um the town of Parts location has so few
 
01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:23.689 align:start position:0%
um the town of Parts location has so few
people

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:23.699 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
um it was a very significant and harmful
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
impact on the overall tax rate of Hearts
 
01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
location and from what I've been able to
 
01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.209 align:start position:0%
location and from what I've been able to
ascertain

01:22:35.209 --> 01:22:35.219 align:start position:0%
ascertain
 
01:22:38.630 --> 01:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
this has happened from time to time in
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
some of the smaller communities in our
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
state so I
 
01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
um am proposing and the Senate agreed
 
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
with this to add
 
01:22:51.290 --> 01:22:51.300 align:start position:0%
language to our
 
01:22:54.729 --> 01:22:54.739 align:start position:0%
um RSA 186 c18 special
 
01:22:58.189 --> 01:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
education state aid that
 
01:23:01.729 --> 01:23:01.739 align:start position:0%
the state could designate an additional
 
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
250 000 of aid
 
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
in particular
 
01:23:12.649 --> 01:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
um for the smallest towns in the state
 
01:23:15.649 --> 01:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
um what I indicated was under a hundred
 
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
under a thousand uh or fewer residents
 
01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:21.719 align:start position:0%
and it would obviously be to mitigate
 
01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
the impact of special ed costs
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
um I I clearly worked with commissioner
 
01:23:28.679 --> 01:23:30.590 align:start position:0%
um I I clearly worked with commissioner
edelblue

01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
edelblue
 
01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
um when this first came to my attention
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
to see if something could be done in the
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
hearts location
 
01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
um situation prior to filing this
 
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
legislation he informed me that even
 
01:23:45.530 --> 01:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
though in the last budget we fully
 
01:23:48.530 --> 01:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
funded catastrophic Aid
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
um there was just no allowance in the
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
statute for something that would be
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
particular like this so
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
um after Consulting with a commissioner
 
01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
I filed um this section of the bill that
 
01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
was included in the Omnibus and I
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
commend it to you I think they're
 
01:24:09.770 --> 01:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
probably a lot of communities that are
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
very small that have a very large impact
 
01:24:16.729 --> 01:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
and would be helped by this designation
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
of fund my understanding is it doesn't
 
01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:21.110 align:start position:0%
of fund my understanding is it doesn't
um

01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
it doesn't create a new expectation of
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
more funding it's just allowing that
 
01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
designation of
 
01:24:32.689 --> 01:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
um the additional 250
 
01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
000 for the smallest communities in the
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
state so thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:41.820 align:start position:0%

01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
you are you gonna able to take a
 
01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
question or two
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%

01:24:50.930 --> 01:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
you and thank you Senator um for taking
 
01:24:53.090 --> 01:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
my question this has been a serious
 
01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
problem for many many years and for a
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
place like hearts location it could just
 
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
um explode their whole budget how will
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
they be able to get their money within
 
01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
that school year and not wait till
 
01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
um the following year is that what this
 
01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
bill does
 
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
well this would not my understanding is
 
01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative and thank you for the
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
question would not be retroactive
 
01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
um it would have to be and let me look
 
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
at the effective date I think hang on
 
01:25:27.649 --> 01:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
UH 60 days after passage so assuming
 
01:25:27.659 --> 01:25:29.209 align:start position:0%
UH 60 days after passage so assuming
that

01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:29.219 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
um we were to pass it this year I think
 
01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
they would qualify for this in the next
 
01:25:42.410 --> 01:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
okay thank you senator
 
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative and Senator
 
01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
Bradley I do have one question we have
 
01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
some communities that are a thousand
 
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
residents or less which uh have a real
 
01:25:58.010 --> 01:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh strong
 
01:26:00.169 --> 01:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
um tax base
 
01:26:00.179 --> 01:26:00.770 align:start position:0%
um tax base
um

01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:00.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
some of the ski areas for example I
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
won't say any names
 
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
but we also have communities such as
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
Monroe that have a strong tax base is
 
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
there any way that this uh a amount that
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
you're putting in here the 250 000 would
 
01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
be earmarked towards the community which
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
has the low equalized property valuation
 
01:26:26.330 --> 01:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
well I didn't specifically try to design
 
01:26:30.890 --> 01:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
language to that effect however if you
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
look at the way it's written it says the
 
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:36.780 align:start position:0%
state may designate an additional 250
 
01:26:39.530 --> 01:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
000 of funds
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
for any community
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
um to mitigate the impacts of special
 
01:26:47.709 --> 01:26:47.719 align:start position:0%
education costs when emergency
 
01:26:51.169 --> 01:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
assistance is necessary to prevent
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
significant financial harm to such
 
01:26:56.810 --> 01:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
community so I think you could make the
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
argument that
 
01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
in a community that has a much more
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
significant and robust property tax base
 
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
that it would not meet that standard
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
potentially of significant financial
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
harm I think that's a better way of
 
01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
doing it than
 
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:20.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know set up an arbitrary number
 
01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
given that you know already the Thousand
 
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
or fewer residents is somewhat of an
 
01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number
 
01:27:33.229 --> 01:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
thank you I think your phrase theology
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
does it yes thank you uh representative
 
01:27:37.610 --> 01:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
Tanner you have one last question and
 
01:27:39.169 --> 01:27:39.179 align:start position:0%
we're then going to let Senator Bradley
 
01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
get back to work
 
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman and thank you
 
01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question I was
 
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
just wondering how this affects small
 
01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
towns that are part of a Cooperative
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
school district and have a a special ed
 
01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:55.129 align:start position:0%
school district and have a a special ed
student

01:27:55.129 --> 01:27:55.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:55.139 --> 01:27:56.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know I'm I'm not certain of the
 
01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:00.300 align:start position:0%
answer to that I think maybe some of the
 
01:28:03.169 --> 01:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
experts on uh your committee might have
 
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
a better idea of how that would work I
 
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
think it
 
01:28:10.129 --> 01:28:10.139 align:start position:0%
um I believe in the case of Hart's
 
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
location they are part of the
 
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
I can't remember the SAU number both in
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
the SAU with Conway and some of the
 
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
other Northern Carroll County towns and
 
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
it's meant to help that community of
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
Hearts location so I believe that it
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Senator Bradley and
 
01:28:37.610 --> 01:28:37.620 align:start position:0%

01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thanks for uh
 
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:43.860 align:start position:0%

advising sessions
 
01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
um as far as the FAFSA Trends you know
 
01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
what we have seen nationally is that as
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
of early April you know FAFSA completion
 
01:31:22.729 --> 01:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
is down uh about 6.7 percent
 
01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh with New Hampshire FAFSA rates uh
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
down 7.6 percent here to date as of
 
01:31:30.770 --> 01:31:30.780 align:start position:0%
early April
 
01:31:32.209 --> 01:31:32.219 align:start position:0%
um in underserved communities and with
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
low-income school districts and we're
 
01:31:35.209 --> 01:31:35.219 align:start position:0%
seeing we need to even start or drop off
 
01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
you know with decreases of around 11
 
01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:38.689 align:start position:0%
you know with decreases of around 11
percent

01:31:38.689 --> 01:31:38.699 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh as of April you know we are in New
 
01:31:44.570 --> 01:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at a 48 completion rate for
 
01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
FAFSA uh for this Academic Year
 
01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh moving forward you know if this if
 
01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass you know neef has
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure in place to expand
 
01:31:56.450 --> 01:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
our services and you know support
 
01:31:58.450 --> 01:31:58.460 align:start position:0%
schools in the rollout of this
 
01:32:01.490 --> 01:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
legislation uh we would we would work
 
01:32:04.129 --> 01:32:04.139 align:start position:0%
with our students and families to reduce
 
01:32:06.110 --> 01:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
the strain and assist with making you
 
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
know what is what can be a very
 
01:32:10.250 --> 01:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
overwhelming process less daunting to
 
01:32:12.050 --> 01:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
them as individuals
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
we do support you know the removal of
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
all barriers you know for New Hampshire
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
students in their pursuit of their
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
higher educational goals and and
 
01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
aspirations career aspirations as well
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
and you know we do feel that we could
 
01:32:26.689 --> 01:32:26.699 align:start position:0%
you know greatly assist schools in this
 
01:32:26.699 --> 01:32:28.129 align:start position:0%
you know greatly assist schools in this
rollout

01:32:28.129 --> 01:32:28.139 align:start position:0%
rollout
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
um we are on we are in agreement with uh
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
you know the amendment to align this
 
01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
2020-23-24 school year which aligned
 
01:32:38.810 --> 01:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
with the FAFSA of simplification
 
01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
legislation at the national level
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh this would allow Neve to you know
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
increase Staffing levels as needed you
 
01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
know in support of you know providing
 
01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
greater support and resources to the
 
01:32:52.090 --> 01:32:52.100 align:start position:0%
school Community
 
01:32:54.649 --> 01:32:54.659 align:start position:0%

01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
across the state uh we would also you
 
01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
know could also develop a informational
 
01:33:06.169 --> 01:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
and educational campaign to help the
 
01:33:07.729 --> 01:33:07.739 align:start position:0%
general public in understanding you know
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know you know and again
 
01:33:17.689 --> 01:33:17.699 align:start position:0%
you know I do want to highlight you know
 
01:33:19.850 --> 01:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
while we are remaining neutral we remain
 
01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
you know committed to you know
 
01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:23.990 align:start position:0%
you know committed to you know
um

01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
any changes that welcome you know FAFSA
 
01:33:28.729 --> 01:33:28.739 align:start position:0%
completion uh increased Equity you know
 
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
among student populations and you know
 
01:33:32.990 --> 01:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
certainly we do not want to see you know
 
01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
students and families leaving
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
um money on the table at the federal
 
01:33:39.649 --> 01:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
level that could be available to them to
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
to assist in their higher education
 
01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:42.830 align:start position:0%
to assist in their higher education
pursue

01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
pursue
 
01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:33:48.169 --> 01:33:48.179 align:start position:0%
uh are there any questions
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
for Mr Atchison
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
yeah represent Heat well thank you again
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and and thank you Joe for
 
01:33:58.430 --> 01:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question one of the
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
populations I've always been concerned
 
01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:01.610 align:start position:0%
populations I've always been concerned
about

01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:34:04.010 --> 01:34:04.020 align:start position:0%
um with regard to
 
01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
um Aid uh the foster children in our
 
01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:08.270 align:start position:0%
um Aid uh the foster children in our
state

01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:34:12.050 --> 01:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
um is there a way to uh especially reach
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
out to them to let them know that
 
01:34:16.490 --> 01:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
something like this is available at this
 
01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
point in time because I think it would
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
be a huge asset for them and and thank
 
01:34:22.129 --> 01:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's a great question yeah and I think
 
01:34:26.570 --> 01:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
you know that example I think is just
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
one you know example of the you know
 
01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
some of the vulnerable populations that
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
we seek to assist you know throughout
 
01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:34.380 align:start position:0%
our spectrum of services so
 
01:34:36.169 --> 01:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
um our advisors do work you know with
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know foster children and parents and
 
01:34:40.970 --> 01:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
families today certainly again with this
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
you know proposed legislation we could
 
01:34:44.330 --> 01:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
incorporate that into part of our
 
01:34:46.370 --> 01:34:46.380 align:start position:0%
campaign I think it as an organization
 
01:34:48.290 --> 01:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
that is you know part of the concerns
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
that we have in terms of you know
 
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
students who are vulnerable who may have
 
01:34:53.570 --> 01:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
a technology Gap at home who may have
 
01:34:55.729 --> 01:34:55.739 align:start position:0%
parents that are you know for for any
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons you know perhaps not
 
01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
fully participating in the uh in in the
 
01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
FAFSA process or are not available to so
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
we would need to you know reach out to
 
01:35:07.570 --> 01:35:07.580 align:start position:0%
you know those vulnerable
 
01:35:09.530 --> 01:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
students and families you know I think
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
of like in students with incarcerated
 
01:35:13.129 --> 01:35:13.139 align:start position:0%
parents as well and you know kind of let
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
them know and you know the bill does
 
01:35:17.209 --> 01:35:17.219 align:start position:0%
include a waiver you know for for people
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
to decline to pursue to fill out the
 
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
application uh we certainly hope that
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
most people would fill out the
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
application and not utilize the waiver
 
01:35:28.129 --> 01:35:28.139 align:start position:0%
but to your point you know it would
 
01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
certainly require an educational
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much further
 
01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
questions uh Mr Atchison
 
01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.510 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:54.470 align:start position:0%
is
h

01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.689 --> 01:35:56.699 align:start position:0%
welcome Mr Carson's
 
01:35:58.490 --> 01:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Ladd uh thank you
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I appreciate
 
01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
your time and energy and
 
01:36:05.209 --> 01:36:05.219 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to keep my comments brief uh
 
01:36:07.610 --> 01:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
as for the record my name is Joel
 
01:36:09.290 --> 01:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
Carstens I'm both the director of
 
01:36:10.610 --> 01:36:10.620 align:start position:0%
financial aid at the University of New
 
01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm also the current
 
01:36:13.850 --> 01:36:13.860 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire
 
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
Association of student financial aid
 
01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
administrators and Association of
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
financial aid professionals throughout
 
01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
the state whose sole focus at colleges
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
and universities is to help students
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
afford the their college education today
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking on behalf of the University
 
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
as you know over the next decade our
 
01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
state is facing declining numbers of
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
high school graduates and that smaller
 
01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
populations of high school graduates
 
01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
will likely have a different
 
01:36:45.070 --> 01:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic profile than historically
 
01:36:47.629 --> 01:36:47.639 align:start position:0%
have been suggested by post-secondary
 
01:36:49.729 --> 01:36:49.739 align:start position:0%
enrollment in the past
 
01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
the next decade is also a time as the
 
01:36:53.930 --> 01:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
committee is well aware when the need
 
01:36:55.129 --> 01:36:55.139 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire workers with
 
01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
post-secondary degrees and credentials
 
01:37:00.290 --> 01:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
has never been higher and that uh and
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
that need is increasing rapidly it's not
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
an option for New Hampshire to leave
 
01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
these students behind who both need the
 
01:37:08.570 --> 01:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
post-secondary degrees and credentials
 
01:37:10.129 --> 01:37:10.139 align:start position:0%
for personal success
 
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
and also the New Hampshire economy that
 
01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
requires a strong environment future
 
01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
also needs those students to be uh or
 
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
those New Hampshire Granite Staters to
 
01:37:24.649 --> 01:37:24.659 align:start position:0%
be participating so University system of
 
01:37:26.209 --> 01:37:26.219 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire supports efforts such as
 
01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
SB 147 to make the pursuit and
 
01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
attainment of post-secondary degrees and
 
01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
credentials part of a comprehensive and
 
01:37:34.250 --> 01:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
coordinated financial literacy strategy
 
01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
the US Department of Education has
 
01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
announced the free application for
 
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
federal student aid will be simplified I
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
believe you've heard that testimony from
 
01:37:45.970 --> 01:37:45.980 align:start position:0%
other members today beginning with the
 
01:37:48.890 --> 01:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
2023-2024 Academic Year anyone who's
 
01:37:50.570 --> 01:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
completed a FAFSA in the past 20 years
 
01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
knows that this is very good news that
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
the simplification process will benefit
 
01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:56.510 align:start position:0%
the simplification process will benefit
everyone

01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
01:37:58.490 --> 01:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
um and as a financially professional I'm
 
01:38:00.410 --> 01:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
excited about this simplification and
 
01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
what this may mean for students in being
 
01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
able to submit a FAFSA in the future but
 
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
my 25 years of education Finance
 
01:38:09.770 --> 01:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
experience tells me that this change
 
01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
will encounter issues both known and
 
01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
unforeseen and this is going to be bumpy
 
01:38:16.970 --> 01:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
on the federal side so in the Senate the
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
university system and then haspa members
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
I represent as the association's
 
01:38:23.209 --> 01:38:23.219 align:start position:0%
president supported an amendment to the
 
01:38:24.890 --> 01:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
bill that would delay the implementation
 
01:38:28.370 --> 01:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
until the 2023 school year to align with
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
this Federal simplification and we
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate the Senate adopting this
 
01:38:33.370 --> 01:38:33.380 align:start position:0%
Common Sense change
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
and that will allow New Hampshire
 
01:38:38.090 --> 01:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Education as well as the
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
federal effort and public schools time
 
01:38:43.610 --> 01:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
to prepare and implement the necessary
 
01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:46.139 align:start position:0%
systems that will track these
 
01:38:47.570 --> 01:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
requirements at the state and local
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
level so as you can as you know from
 
01:38:52.490 --> 01:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
this bill this is going to put some
 
01:38:54.770 --> 01:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
pressure on both the Department of
 
01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
Education likely as well as the state
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
and local level Public School Systems to
 
01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
track all of these different
 
01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
applications and whether students have
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
met this High School graduation
 
01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:05.350 align:start position:0%
met this High School graduation
requirement

01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
delaying for a year gives those systems
 
01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
times to those participants time to
 
01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
appropriately be able to track and
 
01:39:16.490 --> 01:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
develop systems that will help do that
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
in summary completing a FAFSA is a
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
positive step that each high school
 
01:39:22.510 --> 01:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
graduate with post-secondary intentions
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
and those who may be on the fence
 
01:39:26.510 --> 01:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
particularly due to financial concerns
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
can take so the university system of New
 
01:39:31.729 --> 01:39:31.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is ready to continue our
 
01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
support of FAFSA completion and granite
 
01:39:36.169 --> 01:39:36.179 align:start position:0%
Staters post-secondary education Pursuit
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
and attainment I'm happy to entertain
 
01:39:40.610 --> 01:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee may
 
01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:41.330 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee may
have

01:39:41.330 --> 01:39:41.340 align:start position:0%

not seeing the answer oh yes
 
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:49.560 align:start position:0%

testifying this morning
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
um just a quick question
 
01:40:00.530 --> 01:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
um you know we we we just finished up
 
01:40:05.090 --> 01:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
with a bill uh Senate Bill uh 44 where
 
01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.159 align:start position:0%
we talked about the the potential use in
 
01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
the future for uh Pell Grants to to help
 
01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
um you know pay for Workforce
 
01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:15.719 align:start position:0%
Development uh you know Pro credentials
 
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
for Workforce developments do you have
 
01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
to fill out the FAFSA to qualify for
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
pelt yes you would
 
01:40:23.090 --> 01:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
um so students would be required to
 
01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
complete a FAFSA in order to determine
 
01:40:26.689 --> 01:40:26.699 align:start position:0%
their eligibility for the federal Pell
 
01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
Grant the simplified
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
um FAFSA form um is going to boil things
 
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
down to about 18 questions
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
um right now there are about a hundred
 
01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:36.590 align:start position:0%
um right now there are about a hundred
so

01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:39.050 --> 01:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
um the simplification process we think
 
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
dovetails very nicely with this
 
01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:42.050 align:start position:0%
dovetails very nicely with this
requirement

01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
um and we we strongly encourage the
 
01:40:47.050 --> 01:40:47.060 align:start position:0%
house to to also adopt that delayed
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
implementation until the 2023-24
 
01:40:52.490 --> 01:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
academic year when that FAFSA
 
01:40:54.770 --> 01:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
simplification will be available
 
01:40:57.110 --> 01:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh that that's excellent just uh just a
 
01:40:59.689 --> 01:40:59.699 align:start position:0%
quick um uh comment I believe that delay
 
01:41:03.110 --> 01:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
is actually in the bill that we're um it
 
01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't require further Amendment for
 
01:41:06.590 --> 01:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
that yeah thank you that's excellent
 
01:41:07.970 --> 01:41:07.980 align:start position:0%

from the Department of Education
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%

01:41:57.649 --> 01:41:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:57.659 --> 01:41:59.530 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:41:59.530 --> 01:41:59.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
I just have a question for uh Mr Appleby
 
01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.149 align:start position:0%
I just have a question for uh Mr Appleby
Steve

01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
Steve
 
01:42:07.370 --> 01:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to ask the question that
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
currently we have in all these high
 
01:42:11.330 --> 01:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
schools counselors with the
 
01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility of meeting with students
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
to prepare them for the next step
 
01:42:20.209 --> 01:42:20.219 align:start position:0%
following graduation from high school uh
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
be it uh uh technical school be a
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
post-secondary be it the military Etc
 
01:42:30.290 --> 01:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
um the the language in this bill
 
01:42:32.209 --> 01:42:32.219 align:start position:0%
seems to me that it's it's a
 
01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
prerequisite to receiving a high school
 
01:42:37.370 --> 01:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
diploma what the possible option that if
 
01:42:40.609 --> 01:42:40.619 align:start position:0%
a child decides not to do this uh they
 
01:42:42.649 --> 01:42:42.659 align:start position:0%
may not have to
 
01:42:45.229 --> 01:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
um I asked the question why is this
 
01:42:47.570 --> 01:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
necessary if we have counselors in the
 
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
schools why aren't they doing this is
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
just part of the job that's supposed to
 
01:42:57.290 --> 01:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.300 --> 01:43:01.729 align:start position:0%
 
necessary

01:43:01.729 --> 01:43:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440 align:start position:0%

question to be frank
 
01:43:15.169 --> 01:43:15.179 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:43:16.729 --> 01:43:16.739 align:start position:0%
you know currently there are a lot of
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
programs Statewide where schools and
 
01:43:21.169 --> 01:43:21.179 align:start position:0%
those counselors work with students and
 
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:26.520 align:start position:0%

the
 
01:43:30.290 --> 01:43:30.300 align:start position:0%

an annual event to try and encourage
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%

foreign

01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
legislation provides for a waiver
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
um if the family does not want to fill
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%

01:44:36.530 --> 01:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
Ary good morning thank you for the
 
01:44:38.570 --> 01:44:38.580 align:start position:0%

at the end you're asking if we would be
 
01:44:45.770 --> 01:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
also tracking those waivers did I
 
01:44:47.090 --> 01:44:47.100 align:start position:0%

institutions are recognized and highly
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
regarded for their teaching research and
 
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
community service activities
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm really here very quickly to say
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
that college access and success is a
 
01:46:40.850 --> 01:46:40.860 align:start position:0%
strategic priority of the nhcuc and we
 
01:46:43.070 --> 01:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
strongly support increasing the number
 
01:46:46.129 --> 01:46:46.139 align:start position:0%
of students attending college we really
 
01:46:48.530 --> 01:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
feel strongly that attending or
 
01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
attaining a college degree rather is an
 
01:46:52.430 --> 01:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
important accomplishment for students it
 
01:46:54.410 --> 01:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
increases their earning potential as
 
01:46:56.570 --> 01:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
you've heard from several other folks
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
who have testified today and at the same
 
01:47:02.570 --> 01:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
time while it serves uh individuals we
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
also know that it serves our state in
 
01:47:07.330 --> 01:47:07.340 align:start position:0%
terms of our Workforce Development
 
01:47:13.250 --> 01:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
HB 147 I'm sorry that's SB 147 seeks to
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
require students to complete the FAFSA
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
um prior to high school graduation and I
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
think in order to encourage more
 
01:47:23.090 --> 01:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
students to apply and attend college
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's important to remove all the
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
barriers which the FAFSA has been
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
previously and this would be an
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
excellent step moving forward to serve
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
to students and families of New
 
01:47:35.330 --> 01:47:35.340 align:start position:0%

S I see nobody
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
with that we're going to move in to part
 
01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
three of the bill
 
01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:04.980 align:start position:0%

um do we have anybody from the
 
01:49:21.729 --> 01:49:21.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:36.609 --> 01:49:36.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.590 --> 01:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
the director said
 
01:49:40.970 --> 01:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:49:42.530 --> 01:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
um good morning representative how are
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
you can you hear me
 
01:49:46.490 --> 01:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
yes yeah we can hear you just fine
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you and um I do want to
 
01:49:50.930 --> 01:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
start out by introducing myself
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth bilecki I'm the director of
 
01:49:55.310 --> 01:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire DMV
 
01:49:56.810 --> 01:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
um I want to tell you that we're taking
 
01:49:58.970 --> 01:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
a neutral position on this but we did
 
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
work with Senator Khan on on this
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
request from him as well and I'm hopeful
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
that he gave you the background of what
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
he was trying to do and I'm hopeful that
 
01:50:11.689 --> 01:50:11.699 align:start position:0%
there are other speakers behind me that
 
01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
that can really articulate the need and
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
why they were working on this
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
um we do oversee Pupil Transportation in
 
01:50:22.609 --> 01:50:22.619 align:start position:0%
the state and I do have Sergeant Kelby
 
01:50:24.109 --> 01:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
with me who can answer any questions
 
01:50:25.970 --> 01:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
that you have about the transportation
 
01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
of students and our oversight and
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement of that as well
 
01:50:32.450 --> 01:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
centercon identified a need for
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
additional transportation for longer
 
01:50:37.010 --> 01:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
distances and he worked with us to
 
01:50:39.890 --> 01:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
ensure that the two are pretty much
 
01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
tracking the same as far as the
 
01:50:45.649 --> 01:50:45.659 align:start position:0%
qualifications of the driver would be
 
01:50:48.770 --> 01:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
very similar to the qualifications that
 
01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:50.820 align:start position:0%
school bus drivers have to meet right
 
01:50:52.970 --> 01:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
now as far as background certification
 
01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
and training requirements as well he
 
01:50:59.090 --> 01:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
also delineated the difference between
 
01:51:01.129 --> 01:51:01.139 align:start position:0%
utilizing a school bus for school
 
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
transportation to and from school and
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
this proposal include includes only
 
01:51:08.810 --> 01:51:08.820 align:start position:0%
transportation for school related
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
activities that would require travel of
 
01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
at least 75 miles
 
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
um so with that I will stop right here
 
01:51:19.609 --> 01:51:19.619 align:start position:0%
and see if you have any questions that I
 
01:51:23.090 --> 01:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:26.090 --> 01:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative woodcock
 
01:51:27.770 --> 01:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you director
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
for saying my question do you know I I
 
01:51:31.490 --> 01:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
couldn't pick it up from reading the
 
01:51:33.649 --> 01:51:33.659 align:start position:0%
legislation do you know if that's 75
 
01:51:37.970 --> 01:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
miles is total or one way
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
um I I can only see what I'm reading as
 
01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
well it says travel of at least 75 miles
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
I know in discussing with the senator
 
01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:47.750 align:start position:0%
I know in discussing with the senator
Khan

01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
Khan
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
um he looked at it both ways whether it
 
01:51:52.129 --> 01:51:52.139 align:start position:0%
would be a round trip travel or one way
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that bill clarifies
 
01:51:57.410 --> 01:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
what his intent is with this thank you
 
01:51:59.090 --> 01:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
director and thank you Mr chairman
 
01:52:01.310 --> 01:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
this weekend representative Woodcock I
 
01:52:03.590 --> 01:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
did have a call with Jay regarding that
 
01:52:06.530 --> 01:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
same question and uh it wasn't really
 
01:52:08.930 --> 01:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
defined clearly to me I I'm
 
01:52:12.890 --> 01:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
understanding at 75 miles each way okay
 
01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
so for you you know it wouldn't be just
 
01:52:18.830 --> 01:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
30 plus something miles either way so
 
01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:20.290 align:start position:0%
30 plus something miles either way so
okay

01:52:20.290 --> 01:52:20.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
are there further questions for uh
 
01:52:24.649 --> 01:52:24.659 align:start position:0%
director balaki
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
I I do have one uh director can you
 
01:52:30.770 --> 01:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
please explain to me if there's a
 
01:52:33.290 --> 01:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
different requirement for drivers that
 
01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
are driving that are a contract carrier
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
that are carrying uh you know more than
 
01:52:42.770 --> 01:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
16 children do they have different
 
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
requirements or do are they the same as
 
01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
they are for
 
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
um what we're using for our school buses
 
01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
going to and fro uh to school
 
01:52:55.010 --> 01:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative and there there are
 
01:52:59.149 --> 01:52:59.159 align:start position:0%
differences and um I know that Sergeant
 
01:53:01.370 --> 01:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
Kelby is also listening in perhaps he
 
01:53:03.530 --> 01:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
could raise his hand and and he could
 
01:53:06.169 --> 01:53:06.179 align:start position:0%
really uh in in a lot of detail explain
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
that to you as well but there are
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
differences in um licensing requirements
 
01:53:13.729 --> 01:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
background requirements and so forth so
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
I am not sure I was able to identify
 
01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:20.169 align:start position:0%
I am not sure I was able to identify
himself

01:53:20.169 --> 01:53:20.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
yes we'd like to hear a little bit more
 
01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
about the background checks and what has
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
to be done for the driver and the
 
01:53:28.590 --> 01:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
contract carrier
 
01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:29.649 align:start position:0%
contract carrier

01:54:04.669 --> 01:54:04.679 align:start position:0%
I apologize uh you wanted to know the
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
background on uh uh motor care motor
 
01:54:08.689 --> 01:54:08.699 align:start position:0%
coach drivers as opposed to school bus
 
01:54:10.609 --> 01:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
drivers sir that's right the background
 
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
check yes what are there different
 
01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
requirements are they are they similar
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
for the two for your regular school bus
 
01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
driver going to and from school taking
 
01:54:21.709 --> 01:54:21.719 align:start position:0%
the kids to and from school first a
 
01:54:24.109 --> 01:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
contract carrier that may be doing one
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
of these field trips uh 75 miles each
 
01:54:29.689 --> 01:54:29.699 align:start position:0%
each ways and are they the same
 
01:54:31.609 --> 01:54:31.619 align:start position:0%
background checks for the driver that's
 
01:54:33.530 --> 01:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
driving the bus
 
01:54:37.729 --> 01:54:37.739 align:start position:0%
under current legislation the uh
 
01:54:40.250 --> 01:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
any anyone transporting children to and
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
from school related activities under
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
current state law 259.96
 
01:54:48.530 --> 01:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
uh states that all drivers uh need to
 
01:54:49.970 --> 01:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
undergo a criminal background check
 
01:54:52.189 --> 01:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle background check uh
 
01:54:54.350 --> 01:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
minimum training
 
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
um and the names have to be submitted to
 
01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
a roster
 
01:54:59.090 --> 01:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
um to the state of New Hampshire the
 
01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
department of safety that's outside of
 
01:55:02.750 --> 01:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
the requirements for Department of
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
Education so
 
01:55:08.810 --> 01:55:08.820 align:start position:0%
to answer your question uh yes currently
 
01:55:11.149 --> 01:55:11.159 align:start position:0%
well actually no currently if you're
 
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
driving a school bus be it a charter uh
 
01:55:17.689 --> 01:55:17.699 align:start position:0%
school bus or a home to school fashion
 
01:55:21.169 --> 01:55:21.179 align:start position:0%
School Bus you're a school bus driver
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
um that means you you have to have a
 
01:55:24.290 --> 01:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
minimum amount of training undergo all
 
01:55:25.490 --> 01:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
the criminal motor vehicle background
 
01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:27.109 align:start position:0%
the criminal motor vehicle background
checks

01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
checks
 
01:55:31.129 --> 01:55:31.139 align:start position:0%
um for motor carriers uh like Concord
 
01:55:31.139 --> 01:55:32.510 align:start position:0%
um for motor carriers uh like Concord
Coach

01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
Coach
 
01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
under current law they are not allowed
 
01:55:36.770 --> 01:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
to transport for a variety of reasons
 
01:55:40.129 --> 01:55:40.139 align:start position:0%
and they are not uh currently required
 
01:55:42.169 --> 01:55:42.179 align:start position:0%
to undergo a motor vehicle criminal
 
01:55:43.370 --> 01:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
background checks or have minimum
 
01:55:46.669 --> 01:55:46.679 align:start position:0%
training so uh it's important to note
 
01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
that the legislation which I still have
 
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
not seen
 
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
um I I don't have a copy of that
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
legislation unfortunately so I can't
 
01:55:55.550 --> 01:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
weigh in one way or the other
 
01:55:58.850 --> 01:55:58.860 align:start position:0%
um under on the proposed legislation as
 
01:56:01.729 --> 01:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
it has been verbally explained to me
 
01:56:05.209 --> 01:56:05.219 align:start position:0%
uh uh the motor coach like a Concord
 
01:56:07.490 --> 01:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
Coach driver uh would undergo a
 
01:56:09.050 --> 01:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
certification to be a school bus driver
 
01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
but again I can't I haven't seen that I
 
01:56:13.609 --> 01:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
don't have a copy of that legislation
 
01:56:15.770 --> 01:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
um so so uh I really can't answer
 
01:56:17.810 --> 01:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
anything relative to the proposed
 
01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:22.149 align:start position:0%
anything relative to the proposed
legislation

01:56:22.149 --> 01:56:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
again um I can add that the proposed
 
01:56:29.890 --> 01:56:29.900 align:start position:0%
legislation would actually
 
01:56:33.050 --> 01:56:33.060 align:start position:0%
bring into the scope for contract
 
01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
carriers or motor coach drivers would
 
01:56:37.129 --> 01:56:37.139 align:start position:0%
bring them into the scope of what's
 
01:56:39.050 --> 01:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
currently required of the school bus
 
01:56:42.169 --> 01:56:42.179 align:start position:0%
drivers so the third section of the bill
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
where it says that they would be subject
 
01:56:47.570 --> 01:56:47.580 align:start position:0%
to their requirements for training and
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks required
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
under RSA 189 13A those are the
 
01:56:54.649 --> 01:56:54.659 align:start position:0%
background checks required by the
 
01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and then it
 
01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
continues on to say as well as school
 
01:57:01.070 --> 01:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
bus driver certificate requirements
 
01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
under RSA 260 329 that would bring them
 
01:57:07.010 --> 01:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
into the scope of the requirements that
 
01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
current school bus drivers are required
 
01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
to compete
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for very much for that
 
01:57:16.370 --> 01:57:16.380 align:start position:0%
clarification director and Sergeant uh
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
represent Leon do you have a question of
 
01:57:21.770 --> 01:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
either the sergeant or the director
 
01:57:24.169 --> 01:57:24.179 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you Mr chair I do have a
 
01:57:27.410 --> 01:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
question of the director uh would this
 
01:57:29.149 --> 01:57:29.159 align:start position:0%
extend this these School Bus
 
01:57:31.250 --> 01:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
requirements to all drivers for a
 
01:57:33.169 --> 01:57:33.179 align:start position:0%
business like Concord Trailways if they
 
01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:35.159 align:start position:0%
do some school business or would that
 
01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
only be for those those drivers who are
 
01:57:41.209 --> 01:57:41.219 align:start position:0%
approved for school trips
 
01:57:42.050 --> 01:57:42.060 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
01:57:44.570 --> 01:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
representative the way that the bill is
 
01:57:47.089 --> 01:57:47.099 align:start position:0%
um currently structured would be any
 
01:57:50.270 --> 01:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
drivers that would be driving kids for
 
01:57:52.609 --> 01:57:52.619 align:start position:0%
school related activities would have to
 
01:57:54.350 --> 01:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
meet those requirements
 
01:57:57.410 --> 01:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
if you if a motor coach company has
 
01:57:59.209 --> 01:57:59.219 align:start position:0%
drivers that would not be participating
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
in those type of related activities they
 
01:58:03.709 --> 01:58:03.719 align:start position:0%
would not be required to meet those
 
01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:05.639 align:start position:0%
minimum standards
 
01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:13.490 --> 01:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
um my question was very similar to
 
01:58:16.129 --> 01:58:16.139 align:start position:0%
representative Leons thank you okay so
 
01:58:17.330 --> 01:58:17.340 align:start position:0%

are there further questions of the DMV
 
01:58:24.370 --> 01:58:24.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
I don't see any thank you very much for

I would like to justify on this bill
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
okay we have Diana Fenton from the
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Education who would like
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:49.729 --> 01:58:49.739 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning Diana
 
01:58:51.950 --> 01:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
I apologize I'm testifying from the
 
01:58:53.930 --> 01:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
woods of Mount Vernon and I keep losing
 
01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
my connection
 
01:58:57.890 --> 01:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
um so with the committee's permission
 
01:59:00.410 --> 01:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
I'd like to testify as to part two I
 
01:59:02.089 --> 01:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
think I missed my opportunity and I
 
01:59:02.099 --> 01:59:03.290 align:start position:0%
think I missed my opportunity and I
appreciate

01:59:03.290 --> 01:59:03.300 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
01:59:06.410 --> 01:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
being able to Circle back a little bit
 
01:59:08.750 --> 01:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
um part two would simply give the
 
01:59:11.209 --> 01:59:11.219 align:start position:0%
Department of Education access
 
01:59:14.350 --> 01:59:14.360 align:start position:0%
to the records maintained by
 
01:59:17.629 --> 01:59:17.639 align:start position:0%
DHHS their central registry
 
01:59:17.639 --> 01:59:18.410 align:start position:0%
DHHS their central registry
um

01:59:18.410 --> 01:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
when we are credentialing first-time
 
01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:22.250 align:start position:0%
when we are credentialing first-time
applicants

01:59:22.250 --> 01:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee might be
 
01:59:25.490 --> 01:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
familiar with the bill that was passed
 
01:59:26.810 --> 01:59:26.820 align:start position:0%
last session
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
which allows the department to do a
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
criminal background check on first-time
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
applicants for teaching credentials
 
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
this bill Senate Bill 147 part 2 would
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
expand the Department's ability to have
 
01:59:45.050 --> 01:59:45.060 align:start position:0%
access to the dcyf registry
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
it occurred to the Department of
 
01:59:50.990 --> 01:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
Education and our partners at dcyf that
 
01:59:54.050 --> 01:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
if dcyf has flagged an individual who
 
01:59:55.729 --> 01:59:55.739 align:start position:0%
they believe should not have access to
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
Children uh doe is of the position that
 
02:00:00.890 --> 02:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
that individual should not be able to
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
gain access to Children via the
 
02:00:05.689 --> 02:00:05.699 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
02:00:07.910 --> 02:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
and we look forward to working with our
 
02:00:10.010 --> 02:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
sister agencies so that we are all on
 
02:00:13.010 --> 02:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
the same page I will share with you that
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
we had this situation occur
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
um on an individual from the state of
 
02:00:19.370 --> 02:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts who is on the
 
02:00:22.970 --> 02:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts list of DCF they have a
 
02:00:25.010 --> 02:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
different version but their version of
 
02:00:28.250 --> 02:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
dcyf uh that person was on a list in
 
02:00:30.169 --> 02:00:30.179 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts of not being able to have
 
02:00:32.510 --> 02:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
access to children and they came up to
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and became credentialed to
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
teach in New Hampshire
 
02:00:39.229 --> 02:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
so Amy was made aware of the situation
 
02:00:41.330 --> 02:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
and we have worked closely with our
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
partners at dcyf to craft this
 
02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:45.669 align:start position:0%
partners at dcyf to craft this
legislation

02:00:45.669 --> 02:00:45.679 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:00:49.850 --> 02:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
doe has an individual a position that
 
02:00:52.609 --> 02:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
can take this role on so it will not be
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
of any additional cost we do not believe
 
02:00:58.970 --> 02:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
and as dcyf changes their system of
 
02:01:00.410 --> 02:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
their central registry and makes it
 
02:01:03.649 --> 02:01:03.659 align:start position:0%
electronic I think that access will will
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
be even easier to address
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your time and I'm happy to
 
02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
02:01:14.050 --> 02:01:14.060 align:start position:0%
so uh Diana thank you very much so
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
this part two has been put together by
 
02:01:19.250 --> 02:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
the department is that correct
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
it has been put together uh by the
 
02:01:23.570 --> 02:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
department in conjunction with our
 
02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
partners at dcyf I worked with attorney
 
02:01:28.609 --> 02:01:28.619 align:start position:0%
Rebecca Ross this was a joint uh Venture
 
02:01:30.589 --> 02:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
and so we we crafted this language
 
02:01:33.410 --> 02:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
together yes that is correct okay going
 
02:01:35.450 --> 02:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
on part three because that's where we
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
were when we backed up a little bit
 
02:01:40.189 --> 02:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
there understood thank you yeah you're
 
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
more than welcome um goes to the
 
02:01:44.209 --> 02:01:44.219 align:start position:0%
department have any issues with part
 
02:01:44.219 --> 02:01:46.129 align:start position:0%
department have any issues with part
three

02:01:46.129 --> 02:01:46.139 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
uh no we do not we had some questions
 
02:01:51.169 --> 02:01:51.179 align:start position:0%
that have been addressed uh concerning
 
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
the clarity of the language about the 75
 
02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:54.169 align:start position:0%
the clarity of the language about the 75
miles

02:01:54.169 --> 02:01:54.179 align:start position:0%
miles
 
02:01:57.290 --> 02:01:57.300 align:start position:0%
but in terms of the background checks of
 
02:01:59.570 --> 02:01:59.580 align:start position:0%
school bus drivers
 
02:02:01.070 --> 02:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
um that is a function that the
 
02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
department is currently working on
 
02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
getting up to speed on based on pending
 
02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
legislation we're working on our work
 
02:02:08.330 --> 02:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
with our partners at the department of
 
02:02:10.189 --> 02:02:10.199 align:start position:0%
safety to get that
 
02:02:10.199 --> 02:02:11.229 align:start position:0%
safety to get that
um

02:02:11.229 --> 02:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:13.850 --> 02:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
fully effective
 
02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
um so note that the department doesn't
 
02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:17.820 align:start position:0%
have a position on part three of this
 
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you thanks very much
 
02:02:21.709 --> 02:02:21.719 align:start position:0%
are there any questions yes
 
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh Mr chair uh
 
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
attorney just going back to your
 
02:02:30.169 --> 02:02:30.179 align:start position:0%
response on the 75 miles you said you
 
02:02:32.089 --> 02:02:32.099 align:start position:0%
had an explanation of that we don't have
 
02:02:33.410 --> 02:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
that at least I don't have that from the
 
02:02:35.149 --> 02:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
last couple questions we've asked can
 
02:02:37.250 --> 02:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
you tell us is the interpretation of 75
 
02:02:41.390 --> 02:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
miles one way or round trip
 
02:02:43.609 --> 02:02:43.619 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question we didn't
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
have any additional information I was
 
02:02:47.330 --> 02:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
just looking listening to the previous
 
02:02:51.050 --> 02:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
testimony okay I will just look back at
 
02:02:52.490 --> 02:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
my notes
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
um and I believe it was understood to be
 
02:02:59.570 --> 02:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
75 miles each way rather than a total
 
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much thank you I think
 
02:03:05.209 --> 02:03:05.219 align:start position:0%
that's what the intent of Senator Khan
 
02:03:07.189 --> 02:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
was when I talked to one of them and he
 
02:03:10.669 --> 02:03:10.679 align:start position:0%
was out in Chicago uh he was referring
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
to 75 miles in a Direction so that has
 
02:03:17.649 --> 02:03:17.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:20.689 --> 02:03:20.699 align:start position:0%
the reason I was asking that was more on
 
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
that one little line in that paragraph
 
02:03:24.169 --> 02:03:24.179 align:start position:0%
that talks about special education
 
02:03:27.229 --> 02:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
activities I mean the the bulk of the
 
02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
the area is special events after school
 
02:03:32.089 --> 02:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
like those types of things but there is
 
02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
one of those small three or four word
 
02:03:36.109 --> 02:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
disclaimer about special education so I
 
02:03:38.209 --> 02:03:38.219 align:start position:0%
just I think it was is this going to run
 
02:03:40.490 --> 02:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
into a new way to transport youngsters
 
02:03:42.530 --> 02:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
who are special ed youngsters
 
02:03:44.089 --> 02:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
um during the day for activities or
 
02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:46.679 align:start position:0%
events or or therapies that was the 75
 
02:03:48.410 --> 02:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
piece so that was the intent of my
 
02:03:50.570 --> 02:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
questioning thank you yeah and that
 
02:03:52.250 --> 02:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
might be something for attorney Fenton
 
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
to look at too when you're starting a
 
02:03:55.370 --> 02:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
talk special ed you're starting to get
 
02:03:57.950 --> 02:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
in a different domain altogether thank
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
you yes uh are there any further uh
 
02:04:03.229 --> 02:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
folks I want to test it thank you very
 
02:04:06.890 --> 02:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
much uh uh attorney Fenton yes
 
02:04:09.770 --> 02:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
we have Tim Brewer
 
02:04:15.070 --> 02:04:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:16.870 align:start position:0%
 
Brewer

02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
Brewer
 
02:04:20.510 --> 02:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
r-u-e-h-r number two
 
02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:26.030 align:start position:0%
r-u-e-h-r number two
um

02:04:26.030 --> 02:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:30.410 --> 02:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
hello all right yes we can hear you and
 
02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
are you prepared to speak on part three
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
I am um
 
02:04:39.050 --> 02:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
I am the CFO at uh Keene School District
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
SAU 29 we have uh
 
02:04:45.890 --> 02:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
seven districts here some are small Keen
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
being the largest and I've been here for
 
02:04:52.669 --> 02:04:52.679 align:start position:0%
20 years in uh doing this work
 
02:04:54.169 --> 02:04:54.179 align:start position:0%
I wanted to give a little background
 
02:04:56.450 --> 02:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
although many of you may have know this
 
02:05:00.250 --> 02:05:00.260 align:start position:0%
I was surprised to learn uh
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
that though it's a common practice
 
02:05:04.790 --> 02:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the state especially in our
 
02:05:07.850 --> 02:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
Athletics for long-haul trips using a
 
02:05:11.089 --> 02:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
coach motor coach bus is illegal to
 
02:05:14.330 --> 02:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
transport students currently in the
 
02:05:16.490 --> 02:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire although if
 
02:05:18.729 --> 02:05:18.739 align:start position:0%
you've been to your
 
02:05:22.910 --> 02:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
your kids games or your grandkids games
 
02:05:25.250 --> 02:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
you'll see these coach buses rolling up
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
everywhere in fact your student may have
 
02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
gone to DC or Quebec or the Museum of
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
Science on one of these buses
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
um as mine had uh and the department of
 
02:05:40.010 --> 02:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
safety uh director by lucky and uh the
 
02:05:42.770 --> 02:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
sergeant have been incredible uh
 
02:05:44.930 --> 02:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
resources so when I found this out a
 
02:05:47.950 --> 02:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
couple years ago I of course uh
 
02:05:50.810 --> 02:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
shivered a little bit knowing that if
 
02:05:53.330 --> 02:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
one of these buses had an accident
 
02:05:56.209 --> 02:05:56.219 align:start position:0%
that not only could I be liable but my
 
02:05:58.490 --> 02:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
towns and districts would be extremely
 
02:06:00.229 --> 02:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
liable how would they defend themselves
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
putting students on a mode of
 
02:06:04.910 --> 02:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
transportation that is currently illegal
 
02:06:07.490 --> 02:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening right now I've
 
02:06:09.890 --> 02:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
called private companies it's still
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
going on today
 
02:06:13.790 --> 02:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
they aren't rostered they aren't
 
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
background checked and they're driving
 
02:06:18.050 --> 02:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
our students on buses that aren't
 
02:06:20.649 --> 02:06:20.659 align:start position:0%
approved by the state of New Hampshire
 
02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
so I went to Senator Khan who's worked
 
02:06:26.810 --> 02:06:26.820 align:start position:0%
tirelessly to try to address this
 
02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:28.609 align:start position:0%
tirelessly to try to address this
situation

02:06:28.609 --> 02:06:28.619 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:06:30.649 --> 02:06:30.659 align:start position:0%
um so the first reason was the liability
 
02:06:33.770 --> 02:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
the second Department of Safety will
 
02:06:36.890 --> 02:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
tell you and and I I agree a hundred
 
02:06:38.930 --> 02:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
percent that the safest vehicle on the
 
02:06:41.089 --> 02:06:41.099 align:start position:0%
road is a yellow school bus
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
but there becomes a
 
02:06:46.729 --> 02:06:46.739 align:start position:0%
a sense of practical you have to be
 
02:06:51.169 --> 02:06:51.179 align:start position:0%
practical uh a yellow school bus driving
 
02:06:53.510 --> 02:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
kindergartners and first graders on a
 
02:06:56.030 --> 02:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
two-hour trip should have a bathroom for
 
02:06:58.729 --> 02:06:58.739 align:start position:0%
example a football team needs storage if
 
02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
you've seen in a hockey the amount of
 
02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
gear they had our football team would
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
have to travel in three school buses for
 
02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
one team that doesn't include uh JV to
 
02:07:12.410 --> 02:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
go to a away game in Keene we're often
 
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
two hours away
 
02:07:16.669 --> 02:07:16.679 align:start position:0%
I agree that the intent is
 
02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
One Way 75 miles in fact I recently
 
02:07:24.589 --> 02:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
negotiated a new contract where my
 
02:07:27.410 --> 02:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
provider my school bus provider pays us
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
back 500 every time we use a coach bus
 
02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
uh that's over 90 miles
 
02:07:36.830 --> 02:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
um we wanted coach bus simply for Long
 
02:07:38.990 --> 02:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
Haul we're not trying to take business
 
02:07:41.209 --> 02:07:41.219 align:start position:0%
away from school bus companies we want
 
02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
it to be safe but you have to be
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
practical you're going to Washington DC
 
02:07:47.089 --> 02:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
you're not taking a yellow school bus
 
02:07:49.850 --> 02:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
you're driving to Berlin I talked to a
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
business administrator today who told me
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
I said why are you still doing this
 
02:07:55.550 --> 02:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
you're at Great risk he goes I'm not
 
02:07:57.589 --> 02:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
putting my students on a yellow school
 
02:07:59.209 --> 02:07:59.219 align:start position:0%
bus for two and a half hour trip it's
 
02:08:02.030 --> 02:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
not happening so we're just risking it
 
02:08:04.729 --> 02:08:04.739 align:start position:0%
so this is an important issue
 
02:08:08.330 --> 02:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
um and and I I really thank you for
 
02:08:11.330 --> 02:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
listening and considering uh solving
 
02:08:13.490 --> 02:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
this issue because to most people it's a
 
02:08:15.890 --> 02:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
small issue but to me when my
 
02:08:18.109 --> 02:08:18.119 align:start position:0%
reputation's on the line and my
 
02:08:20.689 --> 02:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
District's liabilities on the line and
 
02:08:22.970 --> 02:08:22.980 align:start position:0%
student safety we need to address this
 
02:08:25.790 --> 02:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
sooner than later it's a real issue I
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
02:08:29.689 --> 02:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the information
 
02:08:32.450 --> 02:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
that's uh good stuff uh are there
 
02:08:32.460 --> 02:08:35.870 align:start position:0%
that's uh good stuff uh are there
questions

02:08:35.870 --> 02:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
I don't see any hands up thank you very
 
02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:39.589 align:start position:0%
I don't see any hands up thank you very

much
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:45.050 --> 02:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
so at this point in time we're going to
 
02:08:47.149 --> 02:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
go into part four the last section in
 
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
this particular bill which we've already
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
had uh
 
02:08:54.109 --> 02:08:54.119 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley and former as to what
 
02:08:55.609 --> 02:08:55.619 align:start position:0%
it's all about
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
um we will have uh are there any books
 
02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
he's with the Londonderry School
 
02:09:08.159 --> 02:09:16.910 align:start position:0%
he's with the Londonderry School
District

02:09:16.910 --> 02:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:28.430 --> 02:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:31.609 --> 02:09:31.619 align:start position:0%
am I good yes we can hear you yes Peter
 
02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
I'll be brief okay
 
02:09:37.250 --> 02:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
um everything Tim said um is true
 
02:09:37.260 --> 02:09:37.850 align:start position:0%
um everything Tim said um is true
um

02:09:37.850 --> 02:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:39.950 --> 02:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you Londonderry for example we
 
02:09:42.770 --> 02:09:42.780 align:start position:0%
have the Atlanta marching band
 
02:09:46.070 --> 02:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
um any long trip is used on a coach
 
02:09:48.589 --> 02:09:48.599 align:start position:0%
coach bus now
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
um the number one issue what he brought
 
02:09:51.770 --> 02:09:51.780 align:start position:0%
up was
 
02:09:52.970 --> 02:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
um I believe many of the school
 
02:09:56.030 --> 02:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
districts have a week or half a week
 
02:09:58.129 --> 02:09:58.139 align:start position:0%
trip to DC
 
02:10:00.050 --> 02:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
um and we will line up somewhere around
 
02:10:03.169 --> 02:10:03.179 align:start position:0%
11 coach buses to take the kids from
 
02:10:06.109 --> 02:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
obviously Londonderry into DC
 
02:10:09.709 --> 02:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
we've also use coach buses on um for any
 
02:10:12.050 --> 02:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
lawn field trips field trips or
 
02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:13.550 align:start position:0%
lawn field trips field trips or
Athletics

02:10:13.550 --> 02:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
Athletics
 
02:10:15.410 --> 02:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
um we've got to remember
 
02:10:18.290 --> 02:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
no way does this are we talking about
 
02:10:21.649 --> 02:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
using coach buses or the regular
 
02:10:24.470 --> 02:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
transportation of students from home to
 
02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
school school to home
 
02:10:28.370 --> 02:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
there you are required to have the
 
02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:30.599 align:start position:0%
yellows and remember the yellows are
 
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
there to control the traffic of the road
 
02:10:36.169 --> 02:10:36.179 align:start position:0%
when you're doing Athletics or
 
02:10:39.050 --> 02:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
activities you don't really need the
 
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
yellows there's no traffic there's no
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
road traffic
 
02:10:46.010 --> 02:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
to control the bus pulls up to the to
 
02:10:47.629 --> 02:10:47.639 align:start position:0%
the building
 
02:10:50.450 --> 02:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
students load and of course every every
 
02:10:54.010 --> 02:10:54.020 align:start position:0%
school district has a policy on how many
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
chaperones or coaches are going to be
 
02:10:59.870 --> 02:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
you know are required if it's a field
 
02:11:01.729 --> 02:11:01.739 align:start position:0%
trip or that we're a team
 
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
so they're adults always on the bus
 
02:11:07.370 --> 02:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
there's no Road to Cross no traffic to
 
02:11:07.380 --> 02:11:08.510 align:start position:0%
there's no Road to Cross no traffic to
control

02:11:08.510 --> 02:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
control
 
02:11:10.970 --> 02:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
they get on the bus they go to the
 
02:11:13.310 --> 02:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
destination they get off the bus with
 
02:11:15.229 --> 02:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
the chaperones and coaches
 
02:11:18.530 --> 02:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
do their thing and and come back
 
02:11:18.540 --> 02:11:19.790 align:start position:0%
do their thing and and come back
um

02:11:19.790 --> 02:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
there's there's there's a often
 
02:11:25.970 --> 02:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
um va's pulling the hair out all the
 
02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:26.870 align:start position:0%
um va's pulling the hair out all the
time

02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:11:29.870 --> 02:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
trying to juggle how to get kids to and
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
from home and school in the afternoon
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
in dealing with all the field trip
 
02:11:36.770 --> 02:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
requirements and all the athletic events
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
that go on
 
02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:39.950 align:start position:0%
that go on
um

02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:44.510 --> 02:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
so allowing legally uh because it it
 
02:11:47.689 --> 02:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
does go on uh now
 
02:11:47.699 --> 02:11:48.350 align:start position:0%
does go on uh now
um

02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:52.070 --> 02:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
this flexibility or another tool for
 
02:11:55.250 --> 02:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
districts to use especially on long
 
02:11:55.260 --> 02:11:56.270 align:start position:0%
districts to use especially on long
trips

02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
trips
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh really helps us out immensely and
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
before I leave there's two things and
 
02:12:04.070 --> 02:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
then I'll I'll be done I know you get a
 
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
lot of work Eddie up
 
02:12:08.810 --> 02:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
someone along the line and not not this
 
02:12:10.669 --> 02:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
year but the chairman can make a note or
 
02:12:12.530 --> 02:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
someone make a note
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
we've got to address the issue of a
 
02:12:14.639 --> 02:12:16.010 align:start position:0%
we've got to address the issue of a
Statewide

02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
02:12:19.490 --> 02:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
roster of school bus drivers
 
02:12:21.890 --> 02:12:21.900 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a perfect example
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
for the most part I always say the most
 
02:12:25.790 --> 02:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
part I never say I would there are two
 
02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
big school school bus companies in the
 
02:12:32.089 --> 02:12:32.099 align:start position:0%
state STA and First Student
 
02:12:35.570 --> 02:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
Londonderry has sta Derry has first
 
02:12:35.580 --> 02:12:36.830 align:start position:0%
Londonderry has sta Derry has first
student

02:12:36.830 --> 02:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
student
 
02:12:39.709 --> 02:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
so I'll just use an example we're at a
 
02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
bus drivers we're out flush we've got
 
02:12:45.709 --> 02:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
the Middle School softball team has to
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
go somewhere wherever wherever they need
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
to go to
 
02:12:51.669 --> 02:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
why couldn't I
 
02:12:54.589 --> 02:12:54.599 align:start position:0%
use a first student
 
02:12:59.109 --> 02:12:59.119 align:start position:0%
driver from Derry who's rosted certified
 
02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
licensed everything with the state
 
02:13:04.370 --> 02:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
right now I can't
 
02:13:08.810 --> 02:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
because Mrs Jones is not rosted with the
 
02:13:10.729 --> 02:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
school district of Londonderry
 
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
even though she has all the
 
02:13:15.050 --> 02:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
certifications and licenses whatever
 
02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
so it's someone on the line
 
02:13:19.069 --> 02:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
somebody could have could look at
 
02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
addressing that if you're arrested if
 
02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
you're licensed if you're certified to
 
02:13:25.250 --> 02:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
be a school bus driver
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
and another District needs for whatever
 
02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
reason why couldn't Londonderry in this
 
02:13:31.199 --> 02:13:32.209 align:start position:0%
reason why couldn't Londonderry in this
case

02:13:32.209 --> 02:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:13:34.669 --> 02:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
hi and Mrs Jones
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
um for a student
 
02:13:38.089 --> 02:13:38.099 align:start position:0%
to take the middle school team to
 
02:13:40.609 --> 02:13:40.619 align:start position:0%
whatever they're going
 
02:13:41.930 --> 02:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
um I'd like you know someone could take
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
a note maybe we can
 
02:13:47.149 --> 02:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
come back to that next year and be and
 
02:13:50.089 --> 02:13:50.099 align:start position:0%
maybe address that before I leave Mr
 
02:13:53.870 --> 02:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
chairman on part four you asked a
 
02:13:55.850 --> 02:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
question about
 
02:13:58.250 --> 02:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
um you know when we're talking small
 
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
school districts but some of them have a
 
02:14:02.629 --> 02:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
healthy tax base
 
02:14:04.669 --> 02:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
if you look and just think just just a
 
02:14:04.679 --> 02:14:05.750 align:start position:0%
if you look and just think just just a
suggestion

02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
if you look at the department of Ed
 
02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:08.870 align:start position:0%
if you look at the department of Ed
webpage

02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
webpage
 
02:14:11.330 --> 02:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
there was a table that talks about the
 
02:14:14.629 --> 02:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
average assessment for a student
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
and then there's a state average and
 
02:14:19.490 --> 02:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
then it has the average assessment per
 
02:14:21.890 --> 02:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
student by each district
 
02:14:23.689 --> 02:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
so you may want to use that as a
 
02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
guideline something on the lines if
 
02:14:28.729 --> 02:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
you're lower than the state average
 
02:14:31.910 --> 02:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
and your thousand students or less that
 
02:14:34.970 --> 02:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
may help you qualify to your point
 
02:14:38.990 --> 02:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
about you know looking at the tax base
 
02:14:41.209 --> 02:14:41.219 align:start position:0%
of the of the of the um school district
 
02:14:44.750 --> 02:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
and and not just the population that
 
02:14:46.910 --> 02:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the Crux for those of us
 
02:14:48.890 --> 02:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
who've been around here too long that
 
02:14:51.229 --> 02:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
was kind of the basis of the Claremont 2
 
02:14:51.239 --> 02:14:52.609 align:start position:0%
was kind of the basis of the Claremont 2
decision

02:14:52.609 --> 02:14:52.619 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:14:55.069 --> 02:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
where you know how hot does a tax base
 
02:14:57.890 --> 02:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
work to supply the cost of Education
 
02:15:00.890 --> 02:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
just a suggestion for you I I took a
 
02:15:02.209 --> 02:15:02.219 align:start position:0%
note when when you were talking about
 
02:15:05.209 --> 02:15:05.219 align:start position:0%
that pot with uh Senator Bradley
 
02:15:07.250 --> 02:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
Peter I appreciate your information here
 
02:15:13.310 --> 02:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
um are there questions for
 
02:15:15.850 --> 02:15:15.860 align:start position:0%
senator in a representative
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you Mr chair Mr
 
02:15:21.410 --> 02:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
Carol thank you for taking my question
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
um in your testimony you indicated that
 
02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
most school districts particularly one
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
of the USIS we have a requirement for a
 
02:15:30.350 --> 02:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
large number of corporate carriers like
 
02:15:33.229 --> 02:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
to to Washington or or trips to marching
 
02:15:35.330 --> 02:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
band with equipment or football
 
02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
um that they have their own protocols
 
02:15:38.569 --> 02:15:38.579 align:start position:0%
and they understand that in your
 
02:15:40.609 --> 02:15:40.619 align:start position:0%
protocols in Londonderry do you have a
 
02:15:41.930 --> 02:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
requirements for background checks of
 
02:15:43.850 --> 02:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
those drivers
 
02:15:43.860 --> 02:15:45.229 align:start position:0%
those drivers
no

02:15:45.229 --> 02:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:15:48.589 --> 02:15:48.599 align:start position:0%
okay you're using you know what that's a
 
02:15:51.290 --> 02:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
good point and I may have to um uh I'm
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
going to look into that I appreciate
 
02:15:56.089 --> 02:15:56.099 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you Mr chair thank
 
02:15:58.550 --> 02:15:58.560 align:start position:0%

02:15:58.560 --> 02:15:59.870 align:start position:0%
you are there further questions for Mr
Carol

02:15:59.870 --> 02:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
Carol
 
02:16:02.450 --> 02:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
not seeing hands up thank you very much
 
02:16:11.770 --> 02:16:11.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:15.050 --> 02:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
yes yes we have a panel uh member of the
 
02:16:24.649 --> 02:16:24.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:24.659 --> 02:16:35.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning
 
02:16:45.110 --> 02:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
um sorry I'm I'm down here in the corner
 
02:16:46.849 --> 02:16:46.859 align:start position:0%
in West Milan New Hampshire so I have a
 
02:16:48.650 --> 02:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
little bit of internet problem so if I
 
02:16:50.810 --> 02:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
leave you I apologize
 
02:16:54.770 --> 02:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
um I have been a manager of Laidlaw and
 
02:16:57.770 --> 02:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
then first student and over the years
 
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
I've been in the business 30 years I now
 
02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
own a little school bus company d l
 
02:17:06.169 --> 02:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
Transit and as Laidlaw and first student
 
02:17:08.810 --> 02:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
we have had to use our area coach
 
02:17:08.820 --> 02:17:10.730 align:start position:0%
we have had to use our area coach
companies

02:17:10.730 --> 02:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
companies
 
02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
um on these long trips especially due to
 
02:17:17.330 --> 02:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
the age-old driver shortage
 
02:17:17.340 --> 02:17:18.169 align:start position:0%
the age-old driver shortage
um

02:17:18.169 --> 02:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:21.650 --> 02:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
in the early days I did not know the
 
02:17:23.570 --> 02:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
whole piece of
 
02:17:26.270 --> 02:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
um that we really weren't supposed to be
 
02:17:27.950 --> 02:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
um the schools requested it we would
 
02:17:31.250 --> 02:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
book it until in later days we had to
 
02:17:32.810 --> 02:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
stop that
 
02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
um but the purpose these coaches serve
 
02:17:41.030 --> 02:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
as Tim stated as Mr curio stated with
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
um being able to put all their
 
02:17:45.650 --> 02:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
possessions underneath safe so they're
 
02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
not projectiles on our big school buses
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
trying to secure these items is very
 
02:17:51.599 --> 02:17:53.150 align:start position:0%
trying to secure these items is very
hard

02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
hard
 
02:17:55.969 --> 02:17:55.979 align:start position:0%
um also when you don't have enough
 
02:17:58.129 --> 02:17:58.139 align:start position:0%
drivers being able to get the coach
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
buses to be able to take
 
02:18:03.349 --> 02:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
um a large group so as Tim stated we
 
02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
don't have to utilize three of our
 
02:18:09.169 --> 02:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
drivers to do one trip is huge
 
02:18:09.179 --> 02:18:09.889 align:start position:0%
drivers to do one trip is huge
um

02:18:09.889 --> 02:18:09.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:13.490 --> 02:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
I know in our area we utilize Thomas and
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
Wilson Bus and both of them their
 
02:18:18.110 --> 02:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
drivers do go through criminal
 
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
background checks however they are not
 
02:18:24.650 --> 02:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
as yearly and as extensive as you know
 
02:18:28.969 --> 02:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
our school bus drivers I would worry in
 
02:18:32.450 --> 02:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
this area at least that that our
 
02:18:36.709 --> 02:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
area coach providers would they be able
 
02:18:38.990 --> 02:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
to find drivers that would be willing to
 
02:18:41.690 --> 02:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
go through all the ins and outs to get
 
02:18:44.330 --> 02:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
their school bus certificate that that
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
could be a problem you know trying to
 
02:18:49.370 --> 02:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
trying to find that for you know this
 
02:18:50.810 --> 02:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
these schools
 
02:18:53.629 --> 02:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
quite often the schools when their teams
 
02:18:56.270 --> 02:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
make it to playoffs it's kind of an
 
02:18:59.150 --> 02:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
added little Boon to put them on a a
 
02:19:02.389 --> 02:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
coach instead of a school bus
 
02:19:04.730 --> 02:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
um and you know that these are all
 
02:19:07.310 --> 02:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
reasons I would be for this bill that I
 
02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:08.509 align:start position:0%
reasons I would be for this bill that I
think

02:19:08.509 --> 02:19:08.519 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:19:10.910 --> 02:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
um the coach buses have a purpose as
 
02:19:13.610 --> 02:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
well as our big yellows don't get me
 
02:19:15.950 --> 02:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
wrong as Tim stated I don't think
 
02:19:19.070 --> 02:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
there's anything safer than a big yellow
 
02:19:21.770 --> 02:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
um but I also think that the coach buses
 
02:19:24.230 --> 02:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
in their drivers sometimes I had drivers
 
02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
that went and drove coach buses so
 
02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:27.830 align:start position:0%
that went and drove coach buses so
they're

02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:28.669 align:start position:0%
they're
um

02:19:28.669 --> 02:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:31.849 --> 02:19:31.859 align:start position:0%
all about safety thank you thank you
 
02:19:35.089 --> 02:19:35.099 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions for uh
 
02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
Miss Leslie
 
02:19:38.690 --> 02:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
not seeing hands up thank you very much
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today thank you
 
02:19:43.610 --> 02:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:19:46.270 --> 02:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
so with that we're
 
02:19:50.090 --> 02:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
done 147.
 
02:19:52.490 --> 02:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
do you have any numbers for us on how
 
02:19:55.730 --> 02:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
many Mr Mr chair yes
 
02:19:57.830 --> 02:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
um I had a question earlier on part four
 
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
with a special education about what
 
02:20:02.210 --> 02:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
happens in Cooperative schools and I was
 
02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
kind of waiting until somebody from the
 
02:20:06.830 --> 02:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
Department or
 
02:20:09.469 --> 02:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
um somebody else uh because uh Senator
 
02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
Bradley said to wait
 
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
to answer that question do you know if
 
02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:14.750 align:start position:0%
to answer that question do you know if
that's

02:20:14.750 --> 02:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
in a Cooperative school where you have
 
02:20:19.250 --> 02:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
because we're not basing this on the
 
02:20:21.469 --> 02:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
number of students we're basing it on
 
02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
the number of residents of the community
 
02:20:25.260 --> 02:20:26.990 align:start position:0%
the number of residents of the community
um

02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:29.210 --> 02:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
if you had a Cooperative District some
 
02:20:31.310 --> 02:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
of them have these very small towns
 
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
drawn in
 
02:20:35.690 --> 02:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
and how that's going to work out I I
 
02:20:38.030 --> 02:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
think that when we have represent Tanner
 
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
is a good question that you've asked
 
02:20:42.530 --> 02:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
that we should we're not going to be
 
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
exacting anything today that we have the
 
02:20:46.429 --> 02:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity to call over to the special
 
02:20:49.309 --> 02:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
ed department and to the Folks At Doe
 
02:20:52.730 --> 02:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
and get a response to that for you okay
 
02:20:58.210 --> 02:20:58.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
am I been out I've been unmuted um we're
 
02:21:04.250 --> 02:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
looking at possibly Mark what's Mark's
 
02:21:05.230 --> 02:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
last name
 
02:21:10.030 --> 02:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
Magnolia yeah but he's in finance so I
 
02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay so let's see if uh he has any kind
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
of help for you here on that question
 
02:21:18.110 --> 02:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner can you see it
 
02:21:18.120 --> 02:21:21.410 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner can you see it
awesome

02:21:21.410 --> 02:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:23.210 --> 02:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
hi representative Vlad
 
02:21:26.690 --> 02:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
um how are you doing so so um adequacy
 
02:21:27.889 --> 02:21:27.899 align:start position:0%
um Mark manganello with the Department
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
of Education
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
um with adequacy it's based on it's
 
02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
driven by the municipality but the way
 
02:21:36.349 --> 02:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
um special education goes out it goes
 
02:21:37.610 --> 02:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
out to the school district so it would
 
02:21:40.849 --> 02:21:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:43.190 --> 02:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's your answer representative so
 
02:21:45.889 --> 02:21:45.899 align:start position:0%
there there as a follow-up Mr chair yes
 
02:21:49.010 --> 02:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
go ahead so there would be no
 
02:21:50.990 --> 02:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
um relief for a small town that happened
 
02:21:54.110 --> 02:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
to be part of a Cooperative District
 
02:21:56.750 --> 02:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
or with the Cooperative District
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh see some relief because that small
 
02:22:02.929 --> 02:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:02.939 --> 02:22:04.130 align:start position:0%
 
um yes

02:22:04.130 --> 02:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:05.030 align:start position:0%
um yes
um

02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:08.450 --> 02:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
so the this the community is part of the
 
02:22:10.010 --> 02:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
Cooperative so the Cooperative shares
 
02:22:11.330 --> 02:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
that burden
 
02:22:13.849 --> 02:22:13.859 align:start position:0%
um they educate that student and so they
 
02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
would see the relief but yeah that's
 
02:22:18.050 --> 02:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
that's um it's not targeted for that
 
02:22:19.429 --> 02:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
particular municipality but it is
 
02:22:20.750 --> 02:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
targeted towards the school district
 
02:22:28.130 --> 02:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:30.730 --> 02:22:30.740 align:start position:0%
and help you out representative Tanner
 
02:22:33.710 --> 02:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
I I think it's still unclear to me but
 
02:22:35.870 --> 02:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully we'll get it's still on
 
02:22:37.730 --> 02:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
inclusively also and I think we need to
 
02:22:39.349 --> 02:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
get a little bit more definition from
 
02:22:43.630 --> 02:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:47.450 --> 02:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
I did I mean I basically it was the same
 
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
issue I mean I have near me and in my
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
district a very small town of Roxbury
 
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
um and but Roxbury is part of a much
 
02:22:59.210 --> 02:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
larger Cooperative District wood Roxbury
 
02:23:02.090 --> 02:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
as a very small town be eligible for
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
this additional Aid
 
02:23:07.969 --> 02:23:07.979 align:start position:0%
that's a question we need answered yeah
 
02:23:09.889 --> 02:23:09.899 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think that's what represent
 
02:23:13.490 --> 02:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
Tanner was also it is yeah so we will
 
02:23:16.250 --> 02:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
and and Mark if you hear that from us
 
02:23:17.929 --> 02:23:17.939 align:start position:0%
right now you might pass that on and try
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
and get some resolution for us over at
 
02:23:27.590 --> 02:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:30.290 --> 02:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
okay with that we're going to close uh
 
02:23:33.710 --> 02:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh Senate Bill 147 uh what what are our
 
02:23:34.969 --> 02:23:34.979 align:start position:0%
numbers there
 
02:23:37.130 --> 02:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
all right well rep Shaw's gonna have to
 
02:23:40.070 --> 02:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
double check my numbers I have 12 and
 
02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:41.510 align:start position:0%
double check my numbers I have 12 and
support

02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:23:44.929 --> 02:23:44.939 align:start position:0%
zero opposed to neutral
 
02:23:48.370 --> 02:23:48.380 align:start position:0%
yes I haven't divided we have five cards
 
02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you very much
 
02:23:55.790 --> 02:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
so we have uh 148 in front of us and
 
02:23:57.889 --> 02:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to start uh about an hour
 
02:24:00.590 --> 02:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
ago but uh I think it's important we get
 
02:24:02.570 --> 02:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
all the testimony and answers these
 
02:24:04.670 --> 02:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
questions done properly before we move
 
02:24:06.290 --> 02:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
on to the next bill
 
02:24:08.750 --> 02:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
so here we are with 148 I'm going to
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
start this out and um this bill does
 
02:24:14.090 --> 02:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
have more folks that are interested in
 
02:24:17.210 --> 02:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
it than we've had previously
 
02:24:20.270 --> 02:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
um so we're going to start it out uh but
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
we may have to take a break somewhere
 
02:24:23.690 --> 02:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
along the way here for a launch
 
02:24:29.870 --> 02:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
um yes uh we have several Senators that
 
02:24:35.870 --> 02:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
um our participants in various parts
 
02:24:38.030 --> 02:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
within here we have Senator Prentice for
 
02:24:40.730 --> 02:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
one and we have Senator Ward I don't
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
know if Senator Waters he signed up as
 
02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:44.630 align:start position:0%
know if Senator Waters he signed up as
well

02:24:44.630 --> 02:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:24:47.630 --> 02:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
are any of those able to introduce this
 
02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:49.910 align:start position:0%
are any of those able to introduce this
bill

02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:54.410 --> 02:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:57.530 --> 02:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
ERS Senator Waters
 
02:24:59.809 --> 02:24:59.819 align:start position:0%
I just promoted him and I'm trying again
 
02:25:09.050 --> 02:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
go ahead Senator Waters
 
02:25:14.330 --> 02:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and I didn't
 
02:25:16.969 --> 02:25:16.979 align:start position:0%
know if Senator Ward was here to
 
02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
introduce part one and I don't know how
 
02:25:21.110 --> 02:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
you wanted to proceed on on the various
 
02:25:23.510 --> 02:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
parts but the way we're doing this Dave
 
02:25:26.210 --> 02:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
is that we are introducing the bill as a
 
02:25:28.670 --> 02:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
total then we're wading through that by
 
02:25:31.010 --> 02:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
Parts part one part two part three part
 
02:25:34.490 --> 02:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
four for example Jeb talk to part four
 
02:25:36.370 --> 02:25:36.380 align:start position:0%
of the previous Bill
 
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
well thank you and um if Senator Ward
 
02:25:41.389 --> 02:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
isn't here I'd be happy to do this
 
02:25:41.399 --> 02:25:42.650 align:start position:0%
isn't here I'd be happy to do this
um

02:25:42.650 --> 02:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:45.650 --> 02:25:45.660 align:start position:0%
so um Senate Bill 148 comes uh to you
 
02:25:48.530 --> 02:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
with uh five parts that passed through
 
02:25:51.650 --> 02:25:51.660 align:start position:0%
Senate education five to zero and uh
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
through the Senate 23 to one we
 
02:25:57.410 --> 02:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
endeavored as with all these dreaded
 
02:26:00.650 --> 02:26:00.660 align:start position:0%
Omnibus bills and again I apologize for
 
02:26:02.389 --> 02:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
doing this to you all
 
02:26:04.670 --> 02:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
um but the vetting operation in the
 
02:26:06.050 --> 02:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
Senate was to try to make sure that
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
anything that was controversial or would
 
02:26:10.730 --> 02:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
not be bipartisan was eliminated from
 
02:26:13.070 --> 02:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
the original Bill and so that's what we
 
02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:14.450 align:start position:0%
the original Bill and so that's what we
bring

02:26:14.450 --> 02:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
bring
 
02:26:18.410 --> 02:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
um before you and uh if Senator Ward is
 
02:26:20.809 --> 02:26:20.819 align:start position:0%
not here I can introduce part one and
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
then if you would let me introduce um
 
02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
Parts uh my two parts uh part two and
 
02:26:28.730 --> 02:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
part five uh one after the other that
 
02:26:30.170 --> 02:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
would help with my schedule but that's
 
02:26:32.450 --> 02:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
up to you um
 
02:26:34.070 --> 02:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
Senator what we did
 
02:26:35.870 --> 02:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
was Senator Bradley introduced the bill
 
02:26:37.429 --> 02:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
he was the only Senator hanging around
 
02:26:40.309 --> 02:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
at the time and we let him speak to his
 
02:26:42.889 --> 02:26:42.899 align:start position:0%
car immediately if you'd like to speak
 
02:26:44.570 --> 02:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
to your parts immediately so then you
 
02:26:46.130 --> 02:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
can get on with other Senate business
 
02:26:47.570 --> 02:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
that would be fine
 
02:26:50.330 --> 02:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chairman members of
 
02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:51.110 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chairman members of
the

02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:26:53.270 --> 02:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
of the committee um so I'll start with
 
02:27:02.770 --> 02:27:02.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:05.770 --> 02:27:05.780 align:start position:0%
I'm Senator Waters District Four
 
02:27:09.410 --> 02:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
okay part two all right thank you thank
 
02:27:11.809 --> 02:27:11.819 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman rolling right along
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
um so this bill uh deals with Career and
 
02:27:17.150 --> 02:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
Technical education it was developed by
 
02:27:19.250 --> 02:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education uh
 
02:27:21.290 --> 02:27:21.300 align:start position:0%
particularly Eric frauerth who is the
 
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
CTE Statewide director and I believe he
 
02:27:26.690 --> 02:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
is available for uh questions that may
 
02:27:29.210 --> 02:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
go to him it was also developed by the
 
02:27:32.210 --> 02:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
CTE advisory Council which was
 
02:27:34.250 --> 02:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
established a few years ago with
 
02:27:36.410 --> 02:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd who was a co-sponsor
 
02:27:39.410 --> 02:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
of this section I do know that Senator
 
02:27:41.690 --> 02:27:41.700 align:start position:0%
aladd has some ideas for some changes to
 
02:27:43.790 --> 02:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
this section on on some language about
 
02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
the ctes and I've I've talked about
 
02:27:48.290 --> 02:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
those with him and I and I support them
 
02:27:51.290 --> 02:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
as far as this section goes some of it's
 
02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
some housekeeping language there is some
 
02:27:56.570 --> 02:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
policy to catch up with changes in the
 
02:27:59.450 --> 02:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
CTE system and dual concur enrollment
 
02:28:02.750 --> 02:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
and then also some changes to to catch
 
02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
up with the new
 
02:28:06.050 --> 02:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
Perkins Law which was implemented over
 
02:28:09.050 --> 02:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years so I'll try to
 
02:28:09.950 --> 02:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
go through
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
um rather quickly Mr chairman giving
 
02:28:12.720 --> 02:28:13.550 align:start position:0%
um rather quickly Mr chairman giving
your

02:28:13.550 --> 02:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:28:15.170 --> 02:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
your time
 
02:28:15.180 --> 02:28:15.710 align:start position:0%
your time
um

02:28:15.710 --> 02:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:18.110 --> 02:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
first off we had some definitional
 
02:28:21.469 --> 02:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
change there uh on lines 27 to make sure
 
02:28:23.270 --> 02:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
that private school or home school are
 
02:28:26.450 --> 02:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
also included uh by definition in the
 
02:28:28.969 --> 02:28:28.979 align:start position:0%
sending District
 
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
um then the next uh part has and you'll
 
02:28:34.849 --> 02:28:34.859 align:start position:0%
see this in several places in the bill
 
02:28:38.210 --> 02:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to clarify
 
02:28:41.330 --> 02:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
um that construction and renovation also
 
02:28:43.790 --> 02:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
included expansion replacement when it
 
02:28:46.010 --> 02:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
comes to the cycle of funding for the
 
02:28:49.250 --> 02:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
CTE facilities we've been on a 30-year
 
02:28:52.070 --> 02:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
cycle of construction and renovation of
 
02:28:54.830 --> 02:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
these schools and in four years we'll be
 
02:28:56.510 --> 02:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
turning the crank again to start that
 
02:28:58.849 --> 02:28:58.859 align:start position:0%
cycle over so it's felt that we needed
 
02:29:00.950 --> 02:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
to be sure I mean some of these schools
 
02:29:02.270 --> 02:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
are so old they might have to be
 
02:29:04.370 --> 02:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
replaced some they're going to be needed
 
02:29:06.050 --> 02:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
expanded some just a little bit of
 
02:29:08.690 --> 02:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
renovation is going to be uh needed for
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
them so that's why
 
02:29:12.889 --> 02:29:12.899 align:start position:0%
um that is there
 
02:29:16.849 --> 02:29:16.859 align:start position:0%
then the transportation issue on page
 
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
um three transportation and tuition has
 
02:29:22.490 --> 02:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
been an area of concern for the ctes I
 
02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
know representative Ladd is much
 
02:29:26.570 --> 02:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
concerned about this as as well because
 
02:29:28.670 --> 02:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
we're afraid that over the last several
 
02:29:31.969 --> 02:29:31.979 align:start position:0%
years some sending districts have begun
 
02:29:34.010 --> 02:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
to put a cap on a number of students who
 
02:29:35.710 --> 02:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
can get a career in technical education
 
02:29:38.450 --> 02:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
because the amounts of the
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
transportation tuition provided through
 
02:29:44.809 --> 02:29:44.819 align:start position:0%
d-e-e doe uh didn't did not meet the the
 
02:29:44.819 --> 02:29:46.010 align:start position:0%
d-e-e doe uh didn't did not meet the the
need

02:29:46.010 --> 02:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:29:47.809 --> 02:29:47.819 align:start position:0%
now I just want to note there is no
 
02:29:50.809 --> 02:29:50.819 align:start position:0%
physical note on this section because as
 
02:29:53.870 --> 02:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
always this is governed by what ends up
 
02:29:55.969 --> 02:29:55.979 align:start position:0%
in house bill one and two
 
02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
but it's aspirational here to say that
 
02:30:01.550 --> 02:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
it's important to budget the full cost
 
02:30:04.730 --> 02:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
of transportation and of course that
 
02:30:07.150 --> 02:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
will be determined by the budget writers
 
02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
and as we do now whatever that amount is
 
02:30:12.230 --> 02:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
it gets apportioned out but this
 
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
recognizes that issue that we're facing
 
02:30:16.250 --> 02:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
and then there's just a little
 
02:30:18.110 --> 02:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
clarification about when the
 
02:30:21.050 --> 02:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
reimbursement funds are distributed uh
 
02:30:23.050 --> 02:30:23.060 align:start position:0%
to the schools
 
02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
you'll see again some language on the
 
02:30:28.450 --> 02:30:28.460 align:start position:0%
construction and re replacement
 
02:30:32.510 --> 02:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
issue that consider continues over the
 
02:30:34.969 --> 02:30:34.979 align:start position:0%
next um page and again just just
 
02:30:37.969 --> 02:30:37.979 align:start position:0%
clarifying some things about about that
 
02:30:42.110 --> 02:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
and some needed language changes there
 
02:30:45.650 --> 02:30:45.660 align:start position:0%
then on the next page and I'm now on
 
02:30:47.450 --> 02:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
page four
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
I mentioned earlier The Advisory Council
 
02:30:53.270 --> 02:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
on Career and Technical education
 
02:30:55.250 --> 02:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
if you're not familiar this just been a
 
02:30:58.370 --> 02:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
really terrific Council uh it has CTE
 
02:31:01.429 --> 02:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
directors some legislators uh doe
 
02:31:03.889 --> 02:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
community college system and then most
 
02:31:05.510 --> 02:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
importantly business Representatives
 
02:31:07.790 --> 02:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
people from the various businesses and
 
02:31:10.610 --> 02:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
sectors that are served by ctes are
 
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
there to you know advise as to what is
 
02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
needed for Workforce Development
 
02:31:17.450 --> 02:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
we felt uh that there needed to be a
 
02:31:20.690 --> 02:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
high school counselor officially on
 
02:31:23.809 --> 02:31:23.819 align:start position:0%
um the council and uh so that is what
 
02:31:27.770 --> 02:31:27.780 align:start position:0%
has been added added here
 
02:31:29.929 --> 02:31:29.939 align:start position:0%
um and then we needed to stagger the
 
02:31:31.610 --> 02:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
terms of the members that are on that
 
02:31:35.150 --> 02:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
Council as as well
 
02:31:38.270 --> 02:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
um then the next part here gets into the
 
02:31:40.610 --> 02:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
issue of the um
 
02:31:43.849 --> 02:31:43.859 align:start position:0%
the rule making for the career Readiness
 
02:31:46.190 --> 02:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
credential some of you may recall we
 
02:31:48.590 --> 02:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
passed a career readiness
 
02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
credential which could be fulfilled in a
 
02:31:53.050 --> 02:31:53.060 align:start position:0%
great variety of ways including CTE
 
02:31:55.610 --> 02:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
course taking
 
02:31:57.710 --> 02:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
um and doe came back to us and said they
 
02:31:59.330 --> 02:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
needed some rule making Authority and
 
02:32:01.309 --> 02:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
this got caught up in the covert last
 
02:32:03.349 --> 02:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
year so that's why we
 
02:32:07.070 --> 02:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
um put it uh in in here
 
02:32:09.110 --> 02:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
um the next thing on page five is just
 
02:32:11.809 --> 02:32:11.819 align:start position:0%
that technical language change that uh
 
02:32:13.849 --> 02:32:13.859 align:start position:0%
the the new Perkins Act is called
 
02:32:15.349 --> 02:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
strengthening Career and Technical
 
02:32:18.170 --> 02:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
education the 21st century Act of 2018.
 
02:32:22.010 --> 02:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
so that's why that is uh that is here
 
02:32:25.790 --> 02:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
um then the next uh part on page five
 
02:32:28.969 --> 02:32:28.979 align:start position:0%
um some housekeeping to change the
 
02:32:31.730 --> 02:32:31.740 align:start position:0%
naming of uh some folks who serve in the
 
02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
pre-engineering and Technology
 
02:32:35.690 --> 02:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
curriculum and pre-engineering and
 
02:32:38.330 --> 02:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
Technology advisory Council system
 
02:32:41.690 --> 02:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
language uh clean up there
 
02:32:44.090 --> 02:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
and then um some more
 
02:32:46.429 --> 02:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
issues about you know catching up with
 
02:32:48.410 --> 02:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
legislative language and some policy
 
02:32:51.290 --> 02:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
changes that have been made this deals
 
02:32:53.690 --> 02:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
with the Dual and concurrent
 
02:32:55.849 --> 02:32:55.859 align:start position:0%
enrollment program
 
02:32:58.490 --> 02:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
and I do want to say thank you thank you
 
02:33:02.210 --> 02:33:02.220 align:start position:0%
thank you house for restoring and
 
02:33:03.710 --> 02:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
increasing the funding for this program
 
02:33:06.530 --> 02:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
it is it is a smashing success and if
 
02:33:09.290 --> 02:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
we're talking about career Pathways and
 
02:33:11.389 --> 02:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development and keeping our
 
02:33:13.190 --> 02:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
students in the state and getting good
 
02:33:15.830 --> 02:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
jobs this this has just proved to be a
 
02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
great tool to do that so students can in
 
02:33:21.469 --> 02:33:21.479 align:start position:0%
dual concurrent enrollment programs can
 
02:33:23.270 --> 02:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
take classes that earn them Community
 
02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:24.590 align:start position:0%
take classes that earn them Community
College

02:33:24.590 --> 02:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
College
 
02:33:27.230 --> 02:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
credit and just save them so much money
 
02:33:30.050 --> 02:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
and give them a leg up on their their
 
02:33:33.170 --> 02:33:33.180 align:start position:0%
work so um an important thing here is
 
02:33:36.110 --> 02:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
that we heard from the ctes that you
 
02:33:38.090 --> 02:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
know the the stem having stem courses
 
02:33:41.090 --> 02:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
eligible for this is is great but there
 
02:33:43.490 --> 02:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
are other areas that really in Career
 
02:33:45.230 --> 02:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
and Technical education that aren't
 
02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
technically stem courses but certainly
 
02:33:51.530 --> 02:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
um are valuable as doing concurrent uh
 
02:33:53.570 --> 02:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
enrollment classes and would serve the
 
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
function of Workforce Development and
 
02:33:59.210 --> 02:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
just uh just the same same way so that's
 
02:34:01.610 --> 02:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
why uh that is there and and once again
 
02:34:03.469 --> 02:34:03.479 align:start position:0%
there's no physical note because the
 
02:34:05.150 --> 02:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
amount of funding that has been provided
 
02:34:06.770 --> 02:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
or will be provided we hope in the
 
02:34:09.110 --> 02:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
budget will determine how that gets
 
02:34:11.690 --> 02:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
parceled out uh among
 
02:34:14.690 --> 02:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
um various uh needs for for those funds
 
02:34:14.700 --> 02:34:15.590 align:start position:0%
um various uh needs for for those funds
so

02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:34:17.510 --> 02:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
um that's that's just opens it up a
 
02:34:19.550 --> 02:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
um then the next part on a doing
 
02:34:22.969 --> 02:34:22.979 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment program as you may
 
02:34:27.250 --> 02:34:27.260 align:start position:0%
recall we added grade 10 uh to CTE
 
02:34:30.410 --> 02:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
eligibility eligibility so that is just
 
02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
added in there online
 
02:34:35.990 --> 02:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
um 25 4
 
02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:36.530 align:start position:0%
um 25 4
um

02:34:36.530 --> 02:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:38.929 --> 02:34:38.939 align:start position:0%
and uh then
 
02:34:40.910 --> 02:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:34:45.710 --> 02:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
next uh part here bottom of page five
 
02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:46.330 align:start position:0%
next uh part here bottom of page five
um

02:34:46.330 --> 02:34:46.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
asked the uh community college system
 
02:34:54.050 --> 02:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
um and doe to work together for the
 
02:34:56.510 --> 02:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
model dual and concurrent enrollment
 
02:34:56.520 --> 02:34:57.530 align:start position:0%
model dual and concurrent enrollment
agreement

02:34:57.530 --> 02:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
02:35:00.130 --> 02:35:00.140 align:start position:0%
that should be used by
 
02:35:04.130 --> 02:35:04.140 align:start position:0%
ccsnh in a school district to govern uh
 
02:35:07.849 --> 02:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
that and provide a framework for what is
 
02:35:07.859 --> 02:35:09.469 align:start position:0%
that and provide a framework for what is
there

02:35:09.469 --> 02:35:09.479 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:35:09.479 --> 02:35:10.969 align:start position:0%
there
um

02:35:10.969 --> 02:35:10.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
and then some more language to catch up
 
02:35:15.490 --> 02:35:15.500 align:start position:0%
with this um
 
02:35:21.349 --> 02:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh the uh career uh Readiness credential
 
02:35:22.910 --> 02:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
um it just it would be an awfully good
 
02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
idea for High School uh freshmen to have
 
02:35:27.950 --> 02:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
a conversation about how they're going
 
02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:29.510 align:start position:0%
a conversation about how they're going
to

02:35:29.510 --> 02:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:35:31.490 --> 02:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
um fulfill that assess their student
 
02:35:33.950 --> 02:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
career interests we've been working for
 
02:35:36.530 --> 02:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
quite some time to try to reach back
 
02:35:38.809 --> 02:35:38.819 align:start position:0%
into lower grades to get students
 
02:35:41.389 --> 02:35:41.399 align:start position:0%
interested in an earlier stage in Career
 
02:35:44.510 --> 02:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
and Technical education and career
 
02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:45.530 align:start position:0%
and Technical education and career
Readiness

02:35:45.530 --> 02:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
Readiness
 
02:35:48.050 --> 02:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
um and this would be a a good way to to
 
02:35:49.370 --> 02:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
do that
 
02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:50.090 align:start position:0%
do that
um

02:35:50.090 --> 02:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:52.130 --> 02:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
then finally Mr chairman on this section
 
02:35:54.650 --> 02:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
uh some of you may be familiar with the
 
02:35:56.809 --> 02:35:56.819 align:start position:0%
program we passed a number of years
 
02:35:59.270 --> 02:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
ago to establish a tax credit program
 
02:36:01.250 --> 02:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
for companies that want to donate
 
02:36:05.090 --> 02:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
equipment or have internships or company
 
02:36:08.330 --> 02:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
Personnel teach at the CTE is a
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
supervised students who come out to the
 
02:36:12.889 --> 02:36:12.899 align:start position:0%
workplace has been very successful Eric
 
02:36:14.210 --> 02:36:14.220 align:start position:0%
for our worth can tell you a little bit
 
02:36:16.610 --> 02:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
more about how ctes have grabbed on this
 
02:36:19.090 --> 02:36:19.100 align:start position:0%
to form sector of business
 
02:36:22.250 --> 02:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and so since it's working
 
02:36:25.550 --> 02:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
we want to um extend it out for another
 
02:36:28.429 --> 02:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
another few years
 
02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
um so Mr chairman I I did it and I'm

thank you very much for uh going through
 
02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
part four there
 
02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:39.230 align:start position:0%
part four there
um

02:36:39.230 --> 02:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:41.210 --> 02:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
that's an important section of this
 
02:36:41.220 --> 02:36:42.950 align:start position:0%
that's an important section of this
field

02:36:42.950 --> 02:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
field
 
02:36:46.190 --> 02:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
um yeah if you want to let's see part
 
02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:47.630 align:start position:0%
um yeah if you want to let's see part
five

02:36:47.630 --> 02:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
five
 
02:36:49.730 --> 02:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
that's uh environmental and outdoor
 
02:36:52.190 --> 02:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
outdoor yeah
 
02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:53.330 align:start position:0%
outdoor yeah
um

02:36:53.330 --> 02:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:55.790 --> 02:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps what you ought to do uh Dave is
 
02:36:57.349 --> 02:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
just briefly go through it like you did
 
02:36:59.389 --> 02:36:59.399 align:start position:0%
with me on the horn the other day
 
02:37:01.790 --> 02:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
I will do that and uh thank you very
 
02:37:04.130 --> 02:37:04.140 align:start position:0%
much Mr chairman and the committee too I
 
02:37:06.469 --> 02:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the opportunity to
 
02:37:10.070 --> 02:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
bring this um before before you
 
02:37:11.929 --> 02:37:11.939 align:start position:0%
um so this bill uh addresses the
 
02:37:14.270 --> 02:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
importance of um outdoor education but
 
02:37:15.710 --> 02:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
particularly this is a Workforce
 
02:37:17.570 --> 02:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
Development Bill to deal with the
 
02:37:20.210 --> 02:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation as just such an
 
02:37:23.330 --> 02:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
important part of uh our economy and and
 
02:37:24.650 --> 02:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
everybody thinks of the North country
 
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
but really throughout out the state and
 
02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:28.849 align:start position:0%
but really throughout out the state and
um

02:37:28.849 --> 02:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:30.469 --> 02:37:30.479 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of language in the
 
02:37:31.969 --> 02:37:31.979 align:start position:0%
first part of this bill was just finding
 
02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't go into State Statute but
 
02:37:36.770 --> 02:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
it's important to list here why for New
 
02:37:38.809 --> 02:37:38.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire particularly
 
02:37:40.910 --> 02:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
um you know education about about the
 
02:37:43.070 --> 02:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
environment which can lead to careers in
 
02:37:46.490 --> 02:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
forestry uh or or Forest ecology water
 
02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:47.929 align:start position:0%
forestry uh or or Forest ecology water
ecology

02:37:47.929 --> 02:37:47.939 align:start position:0%
ecology
 
02:37:50.750 --> 02:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
um Fisheries Marine Science and so on
 
02:37:53.210 --> 02:37:53.220 align:start position:0%
and then also for outdoor recreation
 
02:37:55.790 --> 02:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
these are important parts there
 
02:37:57.830 --> 02:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
um and for me having been on the fish
 
02:37:59.210 --> 02:37:59.220 align:start position:0%
and game committee when I was in the
 
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
house I wanted to emphasize that fishing
 
02:38:03.889 --> 02:38:03.899 align:start position:0%
and Hunter education courses are also
 
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:09.770 --> 02:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
um this bill was also very timely
 
02:38:12.410 --> 02:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
because commissioner Caswell has now
 
02:38:16.190 --> 02:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
funded uh the office of outdoor
 
02:38:20.389 --> 02:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
recreation in the Bea
 
02:38:22.190 --> 02:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
um and Scott Crowder some of you may
 
02:38:25.150 --> 02:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
know has been appointed to that position
 
02:38:28.429 --> 02:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
this is something that was caught on by
 
02:38:30.530 --> 02:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
the granite outdoor Alliance which was
 
02:38:34.070 --> 02:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
formed a few years ago by um the Bea a
 
02:38:37.910 --> 02:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
lot of private businesses uh and um
 
02:38:41.270 --> 02:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Senator Bradley and uh so
 
02:38:42.650 --> 02:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
they've been you know championing at the
 
02:38:44.750 --> 02:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
bit for this office to get get funded
 
02:38:46.429 --> 02:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:38:49.429 --> 02:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
some language here supports that wants
 
02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
it to work with our our schools and uh
 
02:38:54.250 --> 02:38:54.260 align:start position:0%
potentially to work with the National
 
02:38:57.889 --> 02:38:57.899 align:start position:0%
Organization that is the the 17 or so
 
02:39:01.070 --> 02:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
states that have this office have a um a
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
kind of Cooperative agreement that could
 
02:39:06.830 --> 02:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
be looked in to as as well
 
02:39:09.469 --> 02:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
um so to get to the heart of the bill
 
02:39:12.410 --> 02:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
starting on line 33 uh it asks the
 
02:39:14.090 --> 02:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
02:39:16.130 --> 02:39:16.140 align:start position:0%
to take the existing
 
02:39:19.750 --> 02:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
model curriculum developed back in 2006
 
02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
endorsed by the Board of Education
 
02:39:24.410 --> 02:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
number of years ago and it updated a
 
02:39:26.809 --> 02:39:26.819 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago so it's an existing
 
02:39:28.730 --> 02:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
curriculum and a bunch of teachers and
 
02:39:32.090 --> 02:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
Educators who are interested in that and
 
02:39:34.910 --> 02:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
um so what it does is say that the the
 
02:39:36.050 --> 02:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
Department of Education will work with
 
02:39:37.730 --> 02:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
that that group
 
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
than to give to the schools so that as
 
02:39:43.130 --> 02:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
they look to develop these these
 
02:39:44.870 --> 02:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
programs they got some great examples
 
02:39:49.610 --> 02:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
and some models to to use
 
02:39:52.490 --> 02:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
um then uh and Mr chairman here
 
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
um I want to mention that I sent you an
 
02:39:56.750 --> 02:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
email and
 
02:39:56.760 --> 02:39:57.410 align:start position:0%
email and
um

02:39:57.410 --> 02:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:00.110 --> 02:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
to the Committees with a Word document
 
02:40:01.510 --> 02:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
last night
 
02:40:04.610 --> 02:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
representative lad and I talked last
 
02:40:07.309 --> 02:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
week about the fact that um
 
02:40:10.190 --> 02:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
the senate had passed this bill which
 
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
has some criteria for adequate education
 
02:40:15.530 --> 02:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
changes and of course you've you've
 
02:40:17.450 --> 02:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
passed and the Senate has passed out of
 
02:40:20.389 --> 02:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
the policy committee senator who adds
 
02:40:23.929 --> 02:40:23.939 align:start position:0%
Bill House Bill 242 which also uh
 
02:40:25.790 --> 02:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
changes the criteria for an adequate
 
02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:27.290 align:start position:0%
changes the criteria for an adequate
education

02:40:27.290 --> 02:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:40:29.450 --> 02:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
so what I did is I went into this bill
 
02:40:32.210 --> 02:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
and basically took what is in house bill
 
02:40:32.220 --> 02:40:33.830 align:start position:0%
and basically took what is in house bill
242.

02:40:33.830 --> 02:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
242.
 
02:40:37.730 --> 02:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
and uh deleted what I have in these
 
02:40:37.740 --> 02:40:39.469 align:start position:0%
and uh deleted what I have in these
criteria

02:40:39.469 --> 02:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
02:40:40.670 --> 02:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
um three
 
02:40:45.950 --> 02:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
six and and uh uh seven and um grafted
 
02:40:48.290 --> 02:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
in the language from House Bill 242 so
 
02:40:50.389 --> 02:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
we got Conformity there
 
02:40:53.090 --> 02:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
and then uh upon the discussion with
 
02:40:55.010 --> 02:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd it seemed as if it
 
02:40:58.370 --> 02:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
would make sense uh to add from
 
02:41:00.650 --> 02:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:41:03.050 --> 02:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
um where it says knowledge of the
 
02:41:05.090 --> 02:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
biological physical and Earth sciences
 
02:41:07.490 --> 02:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
and then say including environmental
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
science which is naturally where it
 
02:41:10.790 --> 02:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh to enable them to understand and
 
02:41:14.230 --> 02:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate the world
 
02:41:16.670 --> 02:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
and Engineering socioeconomic and
 
02:41:18.469 --> 02:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
geopolitical language challenges around
 
02:41:20.090 --> 02:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
them and that that's all Senator
 
02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd's um language and
 
02:41:26.870 --> 02:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
then same thing on uh criteria Romans 6
 
02:41:29.330 --> 02:41:29.340 align:start position:0%

to enable them to enhance their own
 
02:41:41.270 --> 02:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
well-being as well as that of others and
 
02:41:44.330 --> 02:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
then in Romans 7

in a changing Society I'm no
 
02:41:58.610 --> 02:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd you may have some
 
02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
other ideas about how to do that but um
 
02:42:02.030 --> 02:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
you know that's just the point is I
 
02:42:03.770 --> 02:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
think we do need to conform these bills
 
02:42:07.309 --> 02:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
so we don't have a have a conflict
 
02:42:11.090 --> 02:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
um and then lastly uh let me note that
 
02:42:12.889 --> 02:42:12.899 align:start position:0%
the you're going to be perhaps hearing a
 
02:42:14.690 --> 02:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
little later from some folks who are
 
02:42:19.070 --> 02:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
developing community college and high
 
02:42:22.370 --> 02:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
school programs and outdoor recreation a
 
02:42:26.210 --> 02:42:26.220 align:start position:0%
great group and this section here
 
02:42:28.910 --> 02:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
next uh asks the um
 
02:42:32.630 --> 02:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh CTE director to report to advisory
 
02:42:34.309 --> 02:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
Council on Career and Technical
 
02:42:37.370 --> 02:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
education about programs and outdoor
 
02:42:39.110 --> 02:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
recreation and potential for new
 
02:42:41.030 --> 02:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
programs at the ctes
 
02:42:44.270 --> 02:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
now why the adequacy changes and why
 
02:42:46.309 --> 02:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
this section are important
 
02:42:48.530 --> 02:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
is that we've been told that we really
 
02:42:51.650 --> 02:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
need to have somewhere in our statutory
 
02:42:55.010 --> 02:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
language some credit or credentialing
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
for these programs if students are going
 
02:43:00.650 --> 02:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
to be able to use them to get those jobs
 
02:43:02.950 --> 02:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
or to go into
 
02:43:05.870 --> 02:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
programs at the Community College
 
02:43:07.910 --> 02:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
University level so that there needs to
 
02:43:10.070 --> 02:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
be some recognition here for that and
 
02:43:14.150 --> 02:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's what the bill tries to do so um
 
02:43:16.790 --> 02:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I sure hope that was no
 
02:43:18.349 --> 02:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
longer than what we you and I had talked
 
02:43:21.530 --> 02:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
about before and it uh it gets out what
 
02:43:23.929 --> 02:43:23.939 align:start position:0%
you need out there on this part
 
02:43:26.929 --> 02:43:26.939 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much Senator Waters
 
02:43:28.910 --> 02:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot in here
 
02:43:30.770 --> 02:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
and so what we're going to do is we're
 
02:43:32.990 --> 02:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
going to go on with further testimony uh
 
02:43:35.150 --> 02:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
there may be some questions for you that
 
02:43:38.510 --> 02:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
before you escape from us uh would you
 
02:43:40.190 --> 02:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
be willing to take any questions from
 
02:43:41.570 --> 02:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:43:43.910 --> 02:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to I have a I have a
 
02:43:46.130 --> 02:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
meeting at 12 but I can you know toggle
 
02:43:48.770 --> 02:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
back and forth so I'm I'm happy to
 
02:43:50.750 --> 02:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
um you know I'll answer some questions
 
02:43:52.910 --> 02:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
now and then I I can keep one ear
 
02:43:54.889 --> 02:43:54.899 align:start position:0%
attentive so if some come up later after
 
02:43:56.690 --> 02:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
others are testified I'll be I'll be
 
02:43:58.790 --> 02:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
there for you uh representative thank
 
02:44:00.349 --> 02:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
you well represent Leon you have your
 
02:44:01.969 --> 02:44:01.979 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
02:44:03.410 --> 02:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:44:05.929 --> 02:44:05.939 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters my question is on the
 
02:44:08.809 --> 02:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
beginning of part two where it includes
 
02:44:10.849 --> 02:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
children and students in private school
 
02:44:12.410 --> 02:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
and home school in the sending District
 
02:44:15.349 --> 02:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
does that create a financial obligation
 
02:44:18.590 --> 02:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
um they are they already have it it just
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
clarifies it
 
02:44:25.250 --> 02:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
um you know that descending District
 
02:44:27.950 --> 02:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
um is responsible for its students that
 
02:44:30.889 --> 02:44:30.899 align:start position:0%
go to the receiving district and um a
 
02:44:34.070 --> 02:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
lot of home school and um
 
02:44:36.469 --> 02:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
charter school and other students uh do
 
02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
take CTE programs
 
02:44:40.730 --> 02:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
and so we just wanted to make sure that
 
02:44:42.349 --> 02:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
the language is basically this is just
 
02:44:43.730 --> 02:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
an update of the language to make sure
 
02:44:44.809 --> 02:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
that they're included in the definition
 
02:44:47.090 --> 02:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
because this language is from quite a
 
02:44:49.010 --> 02:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
few years ago before there was much
 
02:44:51.590 --> 02:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
legislation around either of those so uh
 
02:44:53.929 --> 02:44:53.939 align:start position:0%
Eric frauerth will be here to fill in
 
02:44:56.510 --> 02:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
some more detail on that but um it's
 
02:44:58.849 --> 02:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
just it's just acknowledging uh those
 
02:45:01.070 --> 02:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
schools and and the importance that CTE
 
02:45:04.130 --> 02:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
education is for students um you know
 
02:45:05.870 --> 02:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
whatever form of Education they're
 
02:45:07.130 --> 02:45:07.140 align:start position:0%
getting in the state they ought to have
 
02:45:09.590 --> 02:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
an opportunity here
 
02:45:11.389 --> 02:45:11.399 align:start position:0%
um thank you Senator I'll follow up with
 
02:45:13.130 --> 02:45:13.140 align:start position:0%
them with the details thank you yeah
 
02:45:15.469 --> 02:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Tanner you have
 
02:45:18.830 --> 02:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
a question yeah uh thank you uh chair
 
02:45:21.650 --> 02:45:21.660 align:start position:0%
and thank you Senator Waters um mine was
 
02:45:26.210 --> 02:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
kind of around the same issue uh that
 
02:45:28.670 --> 02:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
homeschooler is when I talked to my
 
02:45:30.590 --> 02:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
local superintendent and ask him how
 
02:45:32.450 --> 02:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
many homeschooled students there are in
 
02:45:33.770 --> 02:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
our district
 
02:45:37.429 --> 02:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
he says well about uh such and such a
 
02:45:39.410 --> 02:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
number but he he really doesn't have a
 
02:45:42.410 --> 02:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
specific number so for a homeschooled
 
02:45:42.420 --> 02:45:43.490 align:start position:0%
specific number so for a homeschooled
student

02:45:43.490 --> 02:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
student
 
02:45:45.770 --> 02:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
that the district is then going to pick
 
02:45:48.410 --> 02:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
up the tab for do they have to be
 
02:45:51.230 --> 02:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
registered with the Local District
 
02:45:53.630 --> 02:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
um in order to do that because how else
 
02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:54.650 align:start position:0%
um in order to do that because how else
would

02:45:54.650 --> 02:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:45:55.969 --> 02:45:55.979 align:start position:0%
the district
 
02:45:58.670 --> 02:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
be able to budget number one number two
 
02:46:00.170 --> 02:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
how would they
 
02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
be assured that that student resided uh
 
02:46:06.710 --> 02:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
had the you know resided in that
 
02:46:06.720 --> 02:46:07.969 align:start position:0%
had the you know resided in that
District

02:46:07.969 --> 02:46:07.979 align:start position:0%
District
 
02:46:11.929 --> 02:46:11.939 align:start position:0%
um it it just seems to me that it's uh
 
02:46:14.809 --> 02:46:14.819 align:start position:0%
an issue that needs to be clarified more
 
02:46:17.570 --> 02:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um representative for
 
02:46:19.370 --> 02:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
your your question I agree with you I
 
02:46:21.650 --> 02:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
think um Eric flowers will be able to do
 
02:46:25.190 --> 02:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
that I do want to note that um you know
 
02:46:26.630 --> 02:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
I I think it's less likely that a
 
02:46:27.950 --> 02:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
homeschooled student will be
 
02:46:30.830 --> 02:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
homeschooled outside of their their
 
02:46:32.389 --> 02:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
District you know their home is probably
 
02:46:34.370 --> 02:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
in a district but for the private
 
02:46:36.110 --> 02:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
schools it's just clarifying it for
 
02:46:37.730 --> 02:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
private schools actually outside the
 
02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
district but a student wants to take a
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
CTE class they ought to be able to do
 
02:46:44.990 --> 02:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
that but where where do they live
 
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
um where it's where they live and uh and
 
02:46:51.290 --> 02:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
I think also just let's note that this
 
02:46:54.349 --> 02:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
the tuition and transportation funding
 
02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
um that is provided from the state is is
 
02:47:00.290 --> 02:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:02.809 --> 02:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
so the sending schools get to send their
 
02:47:07.250 --> 02:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:08.870 --> 02:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative Mullins you have your
 
02:47:11.210 --> 02:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
hand up yes thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:47:13.610 --> 02:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking my question uh
 
02:47:17.210 --> 02:47:17.220 align:start position:0%
related to what you just said uh are we
 
02:47:20.270 --> 02:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
to assume in looking at this that
 
02:47:23.090 --> 02:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
transportation for private school and
 
02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
homeschooled students to the CTE would
 
02:47:31.370 --> 02:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:34.730 --> 02:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
let's ask Eric frauworth about these
 
02:47:37.309 --> 02:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
because he will he will know how this is
 
02:47:39.710 --> 02:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh this is done a lot of these
 
02:47:41.270 --> 02:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
individual students
 
02:47:44.210 --> 02:47:44.220 align:start position:0%
um do find their own way to the ctes uh
 
02:47:46.490 --> 02:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
or maybe brought by there by our parent
 
02:47:49.250 --> 02:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
or there's a lot of them can drive
 
02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
so um but I'm I'm only asking uh as a
 
02:47:55.370 --> 02:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chair and a comment to
 
02:47:59.389 --> 02:47:59.399 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters I'm only asking as um a
 
02:48:02.570 --> 02:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
town that represents that Oddity of not
 
02:48:06.230 --> 02:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
having the school within its boundaries
 
02:48:08.870 --> 02:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
um our private school students many of
 
02:48:12.110 --> 02:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
them go to uh I represent Bedford but
 
02:48:14.330 --> 02:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
many of our private school students go
 
02:48:19.309 --> 02:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
to Nashua to school and so the question
 
02:48:21.830 --> 02:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
for me would be you know are we are they
 
02:48:24.710 --> 02:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
being transported to the CTE in Nashua
 
02:48:27.050 --> 02:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
are they being transported to the CTE in
 
02:48:27.060 --> 02:48:29.990 align:start position:0%
are they being transported to the CTE in
Manchester

02:48:29.990 --> 02:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:31.370 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:48:31.370 --> 02:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:48:31.380 --> 02:48:32.770 align:start position:0%
yeah
well

02:48:32.770 --> 02:48:32.780 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:48:34.910 --> 02:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
Eric will ask that but if they're in
 
02:48:35.990 --> 02:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
Nashville they'd be going to the
 
02:48:38.630 --> 02:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
National seats the national CTE I mean I
 
02:48:40.370 --> 02:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
don't know but try to let him let him
 
02:48:42.110 --> 02:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
address these details
 
02:48:45.610 --> 02:48:45.620 align:start position:0%
okay it's pretty obvious I'm not sure
 
02:48:48.770 --> 02:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
just to further complicate this
 
02:48:51.110 --> 02:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
conversation I did have a discussion
 
02:48:55.490 --> 02:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
with uh uh Eric frauers over at uh doe
 
02:48:58.070 --> 02:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
regarding this very topic dealing with
 
02:49:00.770 --> 02:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
Manchester Exeter and Nashua
 
02:49:04.610 --> 02:49:04.620 align:start position:0%
and I have put together some amending
 
02:49:04.620 --> 02:49:05.870 align:start position:0%
and I have put together some amending
language

02:49:05.870 --> 02:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:49:08.510 --> 02:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
which would basically say the students
 
02:49:10.550 --> 02:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
resident District shall be responsible
 
02:49:13.190 --> 02:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
for providing transportation and paying
 
02:49:16.730 --> 02:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
the transportation costs and then and
 
02:49:18.770 --> 02:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
shall then be reimbursed from the state
 
02:49:20.929 --> 02:49:20.939 align:start position:0%
if a student is permitted to
 
02:49:23.450 --> 02:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
self-transport the students resident
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
District shall reimburse the student
 
02:49:27.730 --> 02:49:27.740 align:start position:0%
according to rules adopted pursuant to
 
02:49:31.309 --> 02:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
541a until then be reimbursed from State
 
02:49:35.450 --> 02:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
funds kids that are not driven by the
 
02:49:37.969 --> 02:49:37.979 align:start position:0%
school district at a rate of 10 cents
 
02:49:41.510 --> 02:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
per mile May transport if agreed by the
 
02:49:43.429 --> 02:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
sending District the resident District
 
02:49:47.809 --> 02:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed 25 cents per mile that is
 
02:49:50.630 --> 02:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
in rule right now and I think Eric will
 
02:49:53.389 --> 02:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
be addressing that but we need to
 
02:49:56.090 --> 02:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
address I think it's time to address
 
02:49:58.490 --> 02:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
that we have school districts Exeter
 
02:50:00.710 --> 02:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
Nashua and Manchester
 
02:50:02.990 --> 02:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
which are shipping kids from one high
 
02:50:05.809 --> 02:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
school to a CTE Center not located in
 
02:50:07.790 --> 02:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
that high school they are incurring
 
02:50:11.270 --> 02:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
Transportation costs that they're not
 
02:50:13.790 --> 02:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
getting any reimbursement for we need to
 
02:50:16.250 --> 02:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
address this policy issue
 
02:50:18.410 --> 02:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I think that
 
02:50:20.389 --> 02:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
you know that is the the the section A
 
02:50:21.830 --> 02:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
little bit further along in this bill
 
02:50:23.389 --> 02:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
and it's essential I agree with
 
02:50:24.590 --> 02:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
everything you're saying and I think
 
02:50:26.929 --> 02:50:26.939 align:start position:0%
it's an opportunity to provide to the
 
02:50:28.550 --> 02:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
committee we want to may want to provide
 
02:50:30.650 --> 02:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
some clarification around the questions
 
02:50:32.210 --> 02:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
that are being raised about the private
 
02:50:34.670 --> 02:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
or home school in at the same time so I
 
02:50:35.870 --> 02:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
think that that can get all done
 
02:50:35.880 --> 02:50:38.870 align:start position:0%
think that that can get all done
together

02:50:38.870 --> 02:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:41.570 --> 02:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:50:43.910 --> 02:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh um
 
02:50:46.490 --> 02:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters right now we've jumped
 
02:50:48.770 --> 02:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
around a little bit and
 
02:50:52.670 --> 02:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
um we we do have folks ready to talk on
 
02:50:54.889 --> 02:50:54.899 align:start position:0%
on these sections here but we have not
 
02:50:58.010 --> 02:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
discussed all the parks leading up to
 
02:51:00.050 --> 02:51:00.060 align:start position:0%
part three yet we're we haven't talked
 
02:51:02.750 --> 02:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
about part one and part two
 
02:51:06.349 --> 02:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
um okay Mr chair yes I did promote Mr
 
02:51:06.359 --> 02:51:07.490 align:start position:0%
um okay Mr chair yes I did promote Mr
Brown

02:51:07.490 --> 02:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
Brown
 
02:51:08.929 --> 02:51:08.939 align:start position:0%
for all as he raised his hand during
 
02:51:10.969 --> 02:51:10.979 align:start position:0%
that conversation but we also have
 
02:51:14.389 --> 02:51:14.399 align:start position:0%
Senator Prentice who has been waiting
 
02:51:18.110 --> 02:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
um to speak as well so I didn't know
 
02:51:20.330 --> 02:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
she's part three okay so I didn't know
 
02:51:25.690 --> 02:51:25.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:30.170 --> 02:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
been talking about uh part two here the
 
02:51:32.150 --> 02:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical education
 
02:51:35.210 --> 02:51:35.220 align:start position:0%
and and where we're on that right now we
 
02:51:37.010 --> 02:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
can come back to part one I think part
 
02:51:40.610 --> 02:51:40.620 align:start position:0%
one is pretty much uh uh
 
02:51:44.030 --> 02:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
eliminating the doing it it's language
 
02:51:46.070 --> 02:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
to make it current with what we're
 
02:51:47.990 --> 02:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
actually doing
 
02:51:49.250 --> 02:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:51:51.349 --> 02:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
um part two I think we ought to have
 
02:51:54.950 --> 02:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
Eric come up right now on this and he
 
02:51:58.070 --> 02:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
may be able to also uh address some of
 
02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
the issues that uh Senator Waters has
 
02:52:03.830 --> 02:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
addressed and answered questions of the
 
02:52:06.469 --> 02:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
committee on part three a two
 
02:52:08.389 --> 02:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
additionally if I can make it even more
 
02:52:08.399 --> 02:52:09.590 align:start position:0%
additionally if I can make it even more
complicated

02:52:09.590 --> 02:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
02:52:09.600 --> 02:52:11.210 align:start position:0%
complicated

02:54:06.590 --> 02:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh and thank you for
 
02:54:09.349 --> 02:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
hearing this bill uh uh representative
 
02:54:10.910 --> 02:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
Ladd and the committee
 
02:54:12.650 --> 02:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
um I know we've been working on this
 
02:54:13.849 --> 02:54:13.859 align:start position:0%
actually we had been working on this for
 
02:54:15.950 --> 02:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
a couple of years and and hit some covid
 
02:54:18.170 --> 02:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh bumps so I'm glad to see it's back
 
02:54:20.750 --> 02:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
again uh I'm hoping I can answer the
 
02:54:22.429 --> 02:54:22.439 align:start position:0%
questions that you've already brought up
 
02:54:25.490 --> 02:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
around private school the home school
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
and some of the transportation pieces uh
 
02:54:31.070 --> 02:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
and then I um represented Vlad and I
 
02:54:32.510 --> 02:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
have spoken about
 
02:54:34.429 --> 02:54:34.439 align:start position:0%
um some edits that he is going to be
 
02:54:37.730 --> 02:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
proposing and I do have one additional
 
02:54:37.740 --> 02:54:38.570 align:start position:0%
proposing and I do have one additional
um

02:54:38.570 --> 02:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:41.269 --> 02:54:41.279 align:start position:0%
I guess it's almost an unedit so I think
 
02:54:42.710 --> 02:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
start first with your questions that you
 
02:54:43.849 --> 02:54:43.859 align:start position:0%
already had
 
02:54:47.450 --> 02:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
so with regard to uh the private school
 
02:54:49.910 --> 02:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
and homeschool question which is a sort
 
02:54:52.070 --> 02:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the first line right in here
 
02:54:56.690 --> 02:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
in the current legislation in RSA 188
 
02:55:00.130 --> 02:55:00.140 align:start position:0%
it defines a
 
02:55:02.630 --> 02:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
sending District
 
02:55:05.110 --> 02:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
as a school district where a student
 
02:55:07.870 --> 02:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
resides who attends a regional center
 
02:55:12.769 --> 02:55:12.779 align:start position:0%
that is not within their home District
 
02:55:15.650 --> 02:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
so if the law just said that
 
02:55:18.590 --> 02:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
any homeschool charter school or private
 
02:55:20.929 --> 02:55:20.939 align:start position:0%
school kid would already be covered
 
02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
because regardless of where they go to
 
02:55:23.520 --> 02:55:24.410 align:start position:0%
because regardless of where they go to
school

02:55:24.410 --> 02:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:55:26.929 --> 02:55:26.939 align:start position:0%
they're sending district is the school
 
02:55:29.050 --> 02:55:29.060 align:start position:0%
district in which they reside
 
02:55:32.929 --> 02:55:32.939 align:start position:0%
when Charter Schools sort of started
 
02:55:34.610 --> 02:55:34.620 align:start position:0%
growing in New Hampshire for some reason
 
02:55:37.370 --> 02:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
and again this was before me a line was
 
02:55:40.250 --> 02:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
added into this law specifically about
 
02:55:43.309 --> 02:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
what happens to Charter School kids and
 
02:55:44.990 --> 02:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
it was to let people know that if a kid
 
02:55:47.690 --> 02:55:47.700 align:start position:0%
went to a charter school they're sending
 
02:55:50.690 --> 02:55:50.700 align:start position:0%
District was not the charter school but
 
02:55:52.309 --> 02:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
it was wherever the district was that
 
02:55:53.630 --> 02:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
they lived
 
02:55:55.429 --> 02:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
and what we've discovered in the past
 
02:55:58.550 --> 02:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
couple of years is because charter
 
02:56:00.889 --> 02:56:00.899 align:start position:0%
school students were listed specifically
 
02:56:03.410 --> 02:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
homeschool and private school students
 
02:56:05.929 --> 02:56:05.939 align:start position:0%
were almost being taught word in
 
02:56:07.969 --> 02:56:07.979 align:start position:0%
summonses were being told that they
 
02:56:09.349 --> 02:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
weren't listed in the legislation and
 
02:56:11.870 --> 02:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
they couldn't attend CTE and that their
 
02:56:13.849 --> 02:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
home District wasn't going to do
 
02:56:15.650 --> 02:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
anything for them so we wanted to
 
02:56:17.990 --> 02:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
clarify the law by adding this
 
02:56:21.590 --> 02:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
now a student in New Hampshire can
 
02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
attend any CTE Center in the state if
 
02:56:26.530 --> 02:56:26.540 align:start position:0%
there is space
 
02:56:29.570 --> 02:56:29.580 align:start position:0%
regardless of where it is located so if
 
02:56:32.210 --> 02:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
say they live in Manchester but they
 
02:56:35.330 --> 02:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
attend a private school in Nashua
 
02:56:38.570 --> 02:56:38.580 align:start position:0%
they are welcome to attend the Nashua
 
02:56:41.690 --> 02:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
te Center if there is a seat available
 
02:56:44.570 --> 02:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
however their home school district which
 
02:56:47.510 --> 02:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
is Manchester would be the one that
 
02:56:51.170 --> 02:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
would be paying the 25 tuition the other
 
02:56:53.090 --> 02:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
75 percent is still coming from the
 
02:56:53.100 --> 02:56:53.929 align:start position:0%
75 percent is still coming from the
state

02:56:53.929 --> 02:56:53.939 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:56:56.510 --> 02:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
now again notice I did say if there is
 
02:56:57.889 --> 02:56:57.899 align:start position:0%
space available
 
02:57:00.710 --> 02:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
the way the distribution happens is each
 
02:57:04.010 --> 02:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
each CTE Center has assigned school
 
02:57:06.290 --> 02:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
districts that belong that belong to it
 
02:57:09.769 --> 02:57:09.779 align:start position:0%
and there are proportioned seats
 
02:57:11.870 --> 02:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
based on the percentage of students who
 
02:57:13.070 --> 02:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
live in each of those towns and
 
02:57:15.050 --> 02:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
communities so a homeschool is another
 
02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
great example if a homeschool student
 
02:57:19.610 --> 02:57:19.620 align:start position:0%
lives in Manchester and applies to
 
02:57:23.090 --> 02:57:23.100 align:start position:0%
attend MST in Manchester
 
02:57:25.490 --> 02:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
they would be representative of the
 
02:57:27.230 --> 02:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
percentage of students from Manchester
 
02:57:29.929 --> 02:57:29.939 align:start position:0%
that can attend MSD so it isn't
 
02:57:31.550 --> 02:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily that man that a school
 
02:57:33.469 --> 02:57:33.479 align:start position:0%
district would have to budget extra for
 
02:57:35.330 --> 02:57:35.340 align:start position:0%
the homeschool kids they've already
 
02:57:36.889 --> 02:57:36.899 align:start position:0%
accounted for the fact that they would
 
02:57:39.050 --> 02:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
be sending a certain number of students
 
02:57:40.910 --> 02:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
to the CTE Center
 
02:57:43.670 --> 02:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh but again if if the student decide
 
02:57:45.530 --> 02:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
they live in they go to school in Nashua
 
02:57:47.570 --> 02:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
and want to attend that Center if there
 
02:57:49.309 --> 02:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
is a seat available because it wasn't
 
02:57:51.830 --> 02:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
full they can be accepted and attend
 
02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:54.110 align:start position:0%
full they can be accepted and attend
there

02:57:54.110 --> 02:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:57.769 --> 02:57:57.779 align:start position:0%
I hope that helped okay can we take just
 
02:57:59.990 --> 02:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
a short break here Eric on where you
 
02:58:01.610 --> 02:58:01.620 align:start position:0%
where we're going with this sort of the
 
02:58:03.349 --> 02:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
center Apprentice is trying to get in
 
02:58:03.359 --> 02:58:04.510 align:start position:0%
center Apprentice is trying to get in
quickly

02:58:04.510 --> 02:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
02:58:07.010 --> 02:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
she's got to get on some other things
 
02:58:09.290 --> 02:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
and she we have her elevated in here
 
02:58:11.630 --> 02:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
right now Senator Prentice can you hear
 
02:58:11.640 --> 02:58:13.309 align:start position:0%
right now Senator Prentice can you hear
us

02:58:13.309 --> 02:58:13.319 align:start position:0%

um section three
 
02:58:28.010 --> 02:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
of 148 so
 
02:58:29.510 --> 02:58:29.520 align:start position:0%

District Five
 
02:58:39.110 --> 02:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
um and I'm a co-sponsor
 
02:58:41.210 --> 02:58:41.220 align:start position:0%
of section three and I'm standing in
 
02:58:42.290 --> 02:58:42.300 align:start position:0%
today for
 
02:58:43.790 --> 02:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
um Senator Gannon who represents
 
02:58:46.370 --> 02:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
District 23. again to introduce part
 
02:58:48.710 --> 02:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
three of 148 relative to the emergency
 
02:58:52.429 --> 02:58:52.439 align:start position:0%
plans for sports related injuries by way
 
02:58:54.530 --> 02:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
of background I'm a long time paramedic
 
02:58:57.170 --> 02:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
and I actually started my medical career
 
02:58:59.750 --> 02:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
as a student athletic trainer both in
 
02:59:02.630 --> 02:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
high school and in college so I have
 
02:59:04.870 --> 02:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
some background in actually working on
 
02:59:08.809 --> 02:59:08.819 align:start position:0%
emergencies in in in academic athletic
 
02:59:12.590 --> 02:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
setting okay currently a gap exists with
 
02:59:14.929 --> 02:59:14.939 align:start position:0%
emergency plans to respond to serious or
 
02:59:16.429 --> 02:59:16.439 align:start position:0%
potentially life-threatening sports
 
02:59:18.950 --> 02:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
related injuries during school sponsored
 
02:59:22.370 --> 02:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
activities specifically for athletes in
 
02:59:23.929 --> 02:59:23.939 align:start position:0%
the public and non-public school
 
02:59:26.570 --> 02:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
settings that offer Athletics for grades
 
02:59:29.929 --> 02:59:29.939 align:start position:0%
4 through 12. Section 3 of 148 updates
 
02:59:32.290 --> 02:59:32.300 align:start position:0%
our current law that was written in
 
02:59:35.990 --> 02:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
1971. I was in the first grade and this
 
02:59:38.269 --> 02:59:38.279 align:start position:0%
relay is relating to policies adopted by
 
02:59:40.490 --> 02:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
local school boards for the purposes of
 
02:59:42.170 --> 02:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
providing immediate and adequate
 
02:59:44.150 --> 02:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
emergency care for students and
 
02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
Personnel who sustain injury or illness
 
02:59:49.010 --> 02:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
during school hours or during scheduled
 
02:59:51.349 --> 02:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
school activities the Senate education
 
02:59:53.809 --> 02:59:53.819 align:start position:0%
committee amended the language to ensure
 
02:59:55.790 --> 02:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
that the emergency plans for sports
 
02:59:58.190 --> 02:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
related injuries is included in the
 
03:00:00.410 --> 03:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
school's overall emergency response plan
 
03:00:04.010 --> 03:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
and also move the effective date to
 
03:00:06.469 --> 03:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
September 1 2022 to provide District
 
03:00:08.330 --> 03:00:08.340 align:start position:0%
sufficient time to develop an emergency
 
03:00:09.830 --> 03:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
response plan
 
03:00:12.889 --> 03:00:12.899 align:start position:0%
these changes were unanimously supported
 
03:00:16.010 --> 03:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
by the committee and SB 148 was adopted
 
03:00:19.190 --> 03:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar in the Senate
 
03:00:22.250 --> 03:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
by updating the statute this bill not
 
03:00:24.469 --> 03:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
only aligns with the best practices it
 
03:00:26.809 --> 03:00:26.819 align:start position:0%
standardizes emergency plans for sports
 
03:00:29.030 --> 03:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
related injuries and illnesses allowing
 
03:00:31.550 --> 03:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
each energy entity to be informed of the
 
03:00:34.010 --> 03:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
minimum standard of care athletes will
 
03:00:36.769 --> 03:00:36.779 align:start position:0%
receive in addition this bill promotes
 
03:00:39.590 --> 03:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
the flexibility for each School Board to
 
03:00:41.870 --> 03:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
develop appropriate plans based on their
 
03:00:44.630 --> 03:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
geographic location population and
 
03:00:47.090 --> 03:00:47.100 align:start position:0%
District needs it should also be noted
 
03:00:49.370 --> 03:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
that the proposed Bill identifies the
 
03:00:50.870 --> 03:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
public and non-public schools shall
 
03:00:53.269 --> 03:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
establish procedures as part of their
 
03:00:55.610 --> 03:00:55.620 align:start position:0%
plan for athletes with a confirmed
 
03:00:58.610 --> 03:00:58.620 align:start position:0%
covid-19 diagnosis to return to play
 
03:01:01.250 --> 03:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
which is consistent with best practice
 
03:01:04.670 --> 03:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
and expert recommendations in conclusion
 
03:01:07.790 --> 03:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
emergency plans are a zero cost policy
 
03:01:10.130 --> 03:01:10.140 align:start position:0%
that incorporates the resources the
 
03:01:12.469 --> 03:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
school already has available and can be
 
03:01:15.110 --> 03:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
easily modified as the school accesses
 
03:01:17.870 --> 03:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
additional resources I urge the
 
03:01:20.090 --> 03:01:20.100 align:start position:0%
committee to support Section 3 of 148
 
03:01:23.450 --> 03:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 148. there are athletic
 
03:01:25.309 --> 03:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
trainers and other stakeholders who
 
03:01:27.110 --> 03:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
support this they may they have been
 
03:01:29.330 --> 03:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
involved in drafting this legislation
 
03:01:31.550 --> 03:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
that may be here and can speak more
 
03:01:33.650 --> 03:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
directly up to the need and importance
 
03:01:35.929 --> 03:01:35.939 align:start position:0%
for Statewide Baseline for emergency
 
03:01:39.050 --> 03:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
action plans for sports related injuries
 
03:01:42.170 --> 03:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your time of members of the
 
03:01:44.870 --> 03:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
House Education committee uh chairlad
 
03:01:46.790 --> 03:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
and if I can answer any questions I'd be
 
03:01:48.050 --> 03:01:48.060 align:start position:0%
happy to
 
03:01:50.210 --> 03:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much senator now you see
 
03:01:52.490 --> 03:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
what these Omnibus bills do to us you
 
03:01:55.750 --> 03:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
know they totally mess with our minds
 
03:02:00.650 --> 03:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
it is we find the uh the process
 
03:02:02.450 --> 03:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
um challenging on the Senate side too
 
03:02:05.210 --> 03:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
but just like all of us we we uh must
 
03:02:07.550 --> 03:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
run through yeah I understand I
 
03:02:09.710 --> 03:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
understand so what we'll do we'll allow
 
03:02:11.330 --> 03:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
questions to you on this part but then
 
03:02:13.370 --> 03:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
we're going to bounce back to part two
 
03:02:16.250 --> 03:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
and finish up the CTE stuff uh are there
 
03:02:20.290 --> 03:02:20.300 align:start position:0%
questions for uh Senator Apprentice
 
03:02:22.130 --> 03:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner you have your hand
 
03:02:25.190 --> 03:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
up yep yes yes thank you chair and thank
 
03:02:26.990 --> 03:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
you Senator Prentice this is a much
 
03:02:28.730 --> 03:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
needed bill
 
03:02:31.490 --> 03:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
um and I think uh when you say
 
03:02:33.769 --> 03:02:33.779 align:start position:0%
emergencies for sports uh related
 
03:02:36.650 --> 03:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
injuries I'm hoping that this bill
 
03:02:39.010 --> 03:02:39.020 align:start position:0%
extends to practices
 
03:02:42.050 --> 03:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
oftentimes you have practices at odd
 
03:02:44.750 --> 03:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
hours and you know as the coach you're
 
03:02:47.690 --> 03:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
the only one there uh and when you have
 
03:02:49.490 --> 03:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
to call for an emergency it's good to
 
03:02:52.490 --> 03:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
have something like this in place so uh
 
03:02:55.969 --> 03:02:55.979 align:start position:0%
I hope it it the intent is not just at
 
03:02:59.090 --> 03:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
athletic events uh but also at practices
 
03:03:02.630 --> 03:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
and and uh Recreation
 
03:03:07.070 --> 03:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
type events great uh chair may I yes go
 
03:03:09.469 --> 03:03:09.479 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you uh representative Tanner
 
03:03:11.990 --> 03:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
exactly um it's been my experience that
 
03:03:14.750 --> 03:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
the you know when you're having a game
 
03:03:17.630 --> 03:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
and there's a crowd and a plan and all
 
03:03:19.790 --> 03:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
these activities things normally run
 
03:03:22.849 --> 03:03:22.859 align:start position:0%
pretty smoothly there and uh but it is
 
03:03:25.490 --> 03:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
those off hours practices
 
03:03:27.110 --> 03:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
um where you might have to travel a
 
03:03:29.450 --> 03:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
distance to get to a phone to actually
 
03:03:32.510 --> 03:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
call for help and that's a that is you
 
03:03:34.790 --> 03:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
know part of what this this proposal
 
03:03:36.950 --> 03:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
this legislation wants to address is
 
03:03:39.170 --> 03:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
make sure that all is even regardless of
 
03:03:40.730 --> 03:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
whether you're in a game or not if you
 
03:03:43.130 --> 03:03:43.140 align:start position:0%
have a plan and people know what to do
 
03:03:45.650 --> 03:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
um we can we can save lives and I've
 
03:03:47.870 --> 03:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
actually have seen that happen on the on
 
03:03:50.330 --> 03:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
the sports field so thank you thank you
 
03:03:52.429 --> 03:03:52.439 align:start position:0%
for bringing this forward you are so
 
03:03:55.969 --> 03:03:55.979 align:start position:0%
welcome perhaps I would talk
 
03:03:57.769 --> 03:03:57.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you senator
 
03:03:59.870 --> 03:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question just I understand
 
03:04:02.510 --> 03:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
that sports related is there any thought
 
03:04:04.130 --> 03:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
to have this integrated with physical
 
03:04:06.769 --> 03:04:06.779 align:start position:0%
education uh programs that are off-site
 
03:04:10.130 --> 03:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
or at the far part of the site
 
03:04:12.290 --> 03:04:12.300 align:start position:0%
physical education programs then I
 
03:04:13.730 --> 03:04:13.740 align:start position:0%
missed the second part of Europe that
 
03:04:16.370 --> 03:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
are at the far part of the campus
 
03:04:18.710 --> 03:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
for example Fields they're out far away
 
03:04:20.269 --> 03:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
and it just needs to be the physical
 
03:04:22.910 --> 03:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
education uh emergency plan may be
 
03:04:25.750 --> 03:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
relevant uh that's all
 
03:04:29.809 --> 03:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
chair may I yes go ahead a great
 
03:04:31.849 --> 03:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
question representative Woodcock that
 
03:04:34.429 --> 03:04:34.439 align:start position:0%
should be integrated into the school's
 
03:04:37.070 --> 03:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
already emergency response plan uh
 
03:04:39.230 --> 03:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
because that covers
 
03:04:41.690 --> 03:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
I don't call it that well it covers the
 
03:04:43.250 --> 03:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
the day
 
03:04:45.769 --> 03:04:45.779 align:start position:0%
um and all of the classes courses that
 
03:04:48.950 --> 03:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
may be going on this adds the athletic
 
03:04:51.650 --> 03:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
events which are often off hours and
 
03:04:54.410 --> 03:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
sometimes even off campus but we also
 
03:04:56.450 --> 03:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
made sure as a senate amended to put
 
03:04:58.309 --> 03:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
this all in the same plan so yes to your
 
03:05:00.230 --> 03:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
question we're just adding this into
 
03:05:02.870 --> 03:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
that overall emergency plan thank you
 
03:05:04.130 --> 03:05:04.140 align:start position:0%
sir appreciate it thank you Mr chair
 
03:05:06.650 --> 03:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
you're so welcome are there further
 
03:05:09.670 --> 03:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:11.929 --> 03:05:11.939 align:start position:0%
representative your hand up again or is
 
03:05:15.170 --> 03:05:15.180 align:start position:0%
it just not down it's up again uh
 
03:05:15.180 --> 03:05:16.150 align:start position:0%
it just not down it's up again uh
chairman

03:05:16.150 --> 03:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:05:19.670 --> 03:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for recognizing me I'm just um
 
03:05:21.650 --> 03:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
wondering if there was any thought put
 
03:05:22.990 --> 03:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
03:05:26.809 --> 03:05:26.819 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock County got my
 
03:05:29.269 --> 03:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
mind going about extracurricular
 
03:05:31.070 --> 03:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
activities that are not necessarily
 
03:05:33.170 --> 03:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
sports related
 
03:05:35.030 --> 03:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
um theatrical groups that that are
 
03:05:38.269 --> 03:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
practicing you know late in the evening
 
03:05:38.279 --> 03:05:39.590 align:start position:0%
practicing you know late in the evening
um

03:05:39.590 --> 03:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:42.170 --> 03:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
the outdoor education groups
 
03:05:44.150 --> 03:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
we're just talking about Environmental
 
03:05:47.150 --> 03:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
Education that maybe uh you know
 
03:05:49.429 --> 03:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily be part of the
 
03:05:52.309 --> 03:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
school's emergency plan but uh I know
 
03:05:54.530 --> 03:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
sports are probably a little more
 
03:05:56.630 --> 03:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
riskier but certainly some of the
 
03:05:58.969 --> 03:05:58.979 align:start position:0%
Environmental Education has its risks as
 
03:05:58.979 --> 03:06:00.769 align:start position:0%
Environmental Education has its risks as
well

03:06:00.769 --> 03:06:00.779 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:06:00.779 --> 03:06:02.210 align:start position:0%
well
chairman

03:06:02.210 --> 03:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:06:05.030 --> 03:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
yes I might add one thing for you
 
03:06:07.190 --> 03:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner at that if you
 
03:06:13.490 --> 03:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
look at RSA 193 colon 1-c or 110 Dash D
 
03:06:16.309 --> 03:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
colon 3. we are not using the word
 
03:06:17.929 --> 03:06:17.939 align:start position:0%
extracurricular we're using
 
03:06:21.050 --> 03:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
co-curricular okay if you slice into
 
03:06:23.330 --> 03:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
that also intramurals then you're
 
03:06:25.670 --> 03:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
covering all activities whether it be
 
03:06:28.190 --> 03:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
theater production or some other
 
03:06:31.190 --> 03:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
activity that's not curricular of nature
 
03:06:34.370 --> 03:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
during the same day our co-curricular
 
03:06:37.250 --> 03:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
can even be during the school day
 
03:06:40.130 --> 03:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
um but we've been using co-curricular
 
03:06:42.769 --> 03:06:42.779 align:start position:0%
and all these areas RSA if we flip that
 
03:06:45.170 --> 03:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
in rather than saying athletic because
 
03:06:47.210 --> 03:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
athletic is simply a part of
 
03:06:50.870 --> 03:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities I think we have
 
03:06:53.450 --> 03:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
a broader coverage here and be
 
03:06:55.490 --> 03:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
consistent with other forms of our our
 
03:06:57.370 --> 03:06:57.380 align:start position:0%
first actions
 
03:07:00.769 --> 03:07:00.779 align:start position:0%
Senator do you have further
 
03:07:02.870 --> 03:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
I didn't no I don't thank you
 
03:07:05.330 --> 03:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd and and thank you
 
03:07:08.809 --> 03:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:11.650 --> 03:07:11.660 align:start position:0%
okay what we're going to do now because
 
03:07:15.469 --> 03:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
we have one more question I believe
 
03:07:20.050 --> 03:07:20.060 align:start position:0%
uh I did have a question uh
 
03:07:23.269 --> 03:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
yes a rep sound Market uh it thank you
 
03:07:26.090 --> 03:07:26.100 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question uh I'm
 
03:07:28.849 --> 03:07:28.859 align:start position:0%
just looking at how covid-19 is
 
03:07:32.269 --> 03:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
specifically mentioned my question is
 
03:07:34.490 --> 03:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
um what about other contagious
 
03:07:38.330 --> 03:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
infectious conditions uh I'm just
 
03:07:40.610 --> 03:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
wondering if Covenant being mentioned
 
03:07:41.809 --> 03:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
was that
 
03:07:45.349 --> 03:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
that cover similar contagious infectious
 
03:07:45.359 --> 03:07:48.950 align:start position:0%
that cover similar contagious infectious
emissions

03:07:48.950 --> 03:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:52.190 --> 03:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes go go ahead yes okay so
 
03:07:53.570 --> 03:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt thank you for the
 
03:07:55.070 --> 03:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
question I'm going to need to confirm
 
03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
this but it's my understanding that I
 
03:07:58.910 --> 03:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
mean covid-19 is a new infectious
 
03:08:02.809 --> 03:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
contagious condition but schools have
 
03:08:05.090 --> 03:08:05.100 align:start position:0%
um for we're going to just consider all
 
03:08:07.429 --> 03:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
of as representative Ladd I'll just
 
03:08:08.510 --> 03:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
pointed out we're going to represent
 
03:08:10.790 --> 03:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
this all as one package they already
 
03:08:12.410 --> 03:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
have standards
 
03:08:14.870 --> 03:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
um for say return to school and or
 
03:08:17.990 --> 03:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
return to play so covid-19 was added
 
03:08:20.269 --> 03:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
into this to take you know to take that
 
03:08:22.910 --> 03:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
extra step and make sure that it was
 
03:08:25.190 --> 03:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
added onto the list that already existed
 
03:08:27.710 --> 03:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
because you can't return to play you
 
03:08:30.170 --> 03:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
can't return to school unless you meet a
 
03:08:33.410 --> 03:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
certain criteria for a number of you
 
03:08:35.150 --> 03:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
know infectious issues I can remember my
 
03:08:37.309 --> 03:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
daughter when she was in school if she
 
03:08:39.950 --> 03:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
had a temperature within 24 hours she
 
03:08:42.230 --> 03:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
couldn't return to school it had to be
 
03:08:44.690 --> 03:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
clear for that period of time
 
03:08:47.110 --> 03:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
sure thank you thank you you're welcome
 
03:08:49.730 --> 03:08:49.740 align:start position:0%

03:09:44.690 --> 03:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
question about uh Private School charter
 
03:09:48.110 --> 03:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
school and homeschool students uh those
 
03:09:49.429 --> 03:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
students actually have never been
 
03:09:51.170 --> 03:09:51.180 align:start position:0%
included in the transportation piece
 
03:09:53.389 --> 03:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
typically the the private school the
 
03:09:56.090 --> 03:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
parent or the charter school has been
 
03:09:57.950 --> 03:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
providing the transportation the way the
 
03:09:59.929 --> 03:09:59.939 align:start position:0%
legislation is written Transportation
 
03:10:02.929 --> 03:10:02.939 align:start position:0%
goes from the sending school to the CTE
 
03:10:05.570 --> 03:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
Center and so unless the kid can get to
 
03:10:08.389 --> 03:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
you know if a kid is attending uh
 
03:10:11.510 --> 03:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
Private School uh and lives in Concord
 
03:10:14.150 --> 03:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
and can get to Concord and you know or
 
03:10:16.190 --> 03:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
you can get to ball high school and get
 
03:10:17.750 --> 03:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
on the bus because they're a bow student
 
03:10:19.790 --> 03:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
and go to go to Concord but I don't
 
03:10:21.469 --> 03:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
think that's ever happened the charter
 
03:10:23.150 --> 03:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
schools the private schools or the
 
03:10:24.410 --> 03:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
parents of the home school students
 
03:10:26.630 --> 03:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
typically bring the students directly or
 
03:10:28.070 --> 03:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
they drive them to ourselves to the CTE
 
03:10:31.130 --> 03:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
centers but as representative Ladd and
 
03:10:33.830 --> 03:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters mentioned what uh some
 
03:10:35.510 --> 03:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
wording chains that representative lad
 
03:10:37.910 --> 03:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
and I worked on is to fix the problem
 
03:10:40.929 --> 03:10:40.939 align:start position:0%
for Manchester Nashua and Exeter
 
03:10:44.510 --> 03:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
that rather than using the the language
 
03:10:46.490 --> 03:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
of the sending School District which is
 
03:10:47.990 --> 03:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
which would eliminate those three
 
03:10:50.210 --> 03:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
districts we changed it to I believe the
 
03:10:52.250 --> 03:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
home school district is putting the
 
03:10:55.150 --> 03:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
transportation so that will allow
 
03:10:58.550 --> 03:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
Nashua to apply for reimbursement
 
03:11:00.889 --> 03:11:00.899 align:start position:0%
between north and south and Manchester
 
03:11:02.570 --> 03:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
in between all of the schools that are
 
03:11:05.030 --> 03:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
providing to MST and for Exeter because
 
03:11:07.550 --> 03:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
they are the only CTE Center not
 
03:11:09.110 --> 03:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
actually located where the high school
 
03:11:09.120 --> 03:11:09.950 align:start position:0%
actually located where the high school
is

03:11:09.950 --> 03:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:11:12.530 --> 03:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
uh so we did understand that that was a
 
03:11:14.870 --> 03:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
challenge and uh in this legislation
 
03:11:17.929 --> 03:11:17.939 align:start position:0%
we're fixing it that it will no longer
 
03:11:20.809 --> 03:11:20.819 align:start position:0%
be 10 cents per mile per kid but it will
 
03:11:23.330 --> 03:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
be the actual cost of the transportation
 
03:11:26.330 --> 03:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
because our schools were losing uh
 
03:11:28.250 --> 03:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars in
 
03:11:30.410 --> 03:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
transportation because they need to
 
03:11:32.870 --> 03:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
spend 750 on a bus
 
03:11:35.150 --> 03:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
for four kids and they were only getting
 
03:11:38.750 --> 03:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursed 10 cents per mile uh so uh we
 
03:11:40.730 --> 03:11:40.740 align:start position:0%
did realize that that uh that became a
 
03:11:43.429 --> 03:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
big burden so
 
03:11:46.490 --> 03:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
um so we didn't fix that piece
 
03:11:51.349 --> 03:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
um the only other note I actually had uh
 
03:11:51.359 --> 03:11:53.330 align:start position:0%
um the only other note I actually had uh
was

03:11:53.330 --> 03:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:11:57.110 --> 03:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:59.510 --> 03:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
now we need to find it I'm sorry I
 
03:12:02.750 --> 03:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
believe it is Page four
 
03:12:05.870 --> 03:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh as part of the construction piece uh
 
03:12:08.030 --> 03:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
in an in the request in the editing of
 
03:12:11.570 --> 03:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
this bill we'd asked to remove
 
03:12:13.790 --> 03:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
um Part F line two where it says accept
 
03:12:16.790 --> 03:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
students from sending schools as we were
 
03:12:20.090 --> 03:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
discussing this with the construction in
 
03:12:21.530 --> 03:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:12:24.830 --> 03:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
we were reading it to say that in order
 
03:12:28.130 --> 03:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
to receive funding for construction a
 
03:12:30.410 --> 03:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
CTE Center must accept students from
 
03:12:32.690 --> 03:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
sending schools
 
03:12:35.570 --> 03:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
we have three CTE centers that do not
 
03:12:37.790 --> 03:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
have any sending districts
 
03:12:40.610 --> 03:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
and so as we were reading this we we
 
03:12:42.110 --> 03:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
said well now they're not going to be
 
03:12:43.670 --> 03:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
eligible for the renovation funds
 
03:12:45.110 --> 03:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
because they don't accept sending
 
03:12:45.120 --> 03:12:46.550 align:start position:0%
because they don't accept sending
students

03:12:46.550 --> 03:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:12:46.560 --> 03:12:48.110 align:start position:0%
students
uh

03:12:48.110 --> 03:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:12:50.570 --> 03:12:50.580 align:start position:0%
after so we we all agreed and put this
 
03:12:52.490 --> 03:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
through uh commissioner edelblue
 
03:12:55.250 --> 03:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
interestingly read it differently
 
03:12:57.290 --> 03:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
he said even though for example
 
03:12:59.269 --> 03:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth which does not have any
 
03:13:02.210 --> 03:13:02.220 align:start position:0%
sending districts if a kid from Dover
 
03:13:04.429 --> 03:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to attend a program at Portsmouth
 
03:13:07.130 --> 03:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
because Portsmouth had one
 
03:13:09.590 --> 03:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth would accept them so they by
 
03:13:11.450 --> 03:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
definition are accepting a sending
 
03:13:11.460 --> 03:13:12.469 align:start position:0%
definition are accepting a sending
student

03:13:12.469 --> 03:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
student
 
03:13:16.070 --> 03:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
so if we if we eliminated that in here
 
03:13:17.929 --> 03:13:17.939 align:start position:0%
he was afraid that although nobody would
 
03:13:20.030 --> 03:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
do it a school could go great we've
 
03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
accepted all this money from the state
 
03:13:22.910 --> 03:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
and now we're no longer going to accept
 
03:13:25.849 --> 03:13:25.859 align:start position:0%
students from sending schools so I would
 
03:13:27.889 --> 03:13:27.899 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that the committee
 
03:13:29.870 --> 03:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
remove our request
 
03:13:35.150 --> 03:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:35.160 --> 03:13:36.140 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:13:36.140 --> 03:13:36.150 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:13:36.150 --> 03:13:38.030 align:start position:0%
okay
[Music]

03:13:38.030 --> 03:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:13:39.830 --> 03:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
represent mile are you up your hand up
 
03:13:42.590 --> 03:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
yeah yes uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:13:45.290 --> 03:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
you Eric for taking my question how does
 
03:13:46.969 --> 03:13:46.979 align:start position:0%
I have two questions
 
03:13:50.809 --> 03:13:50.819 align:start position:0%
if a school district has a certain quota
 
03:13:54.170 --> 03:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
that they have to send to a particular
 
03:13:55.969 --> 03:13:55.979 align:start position:0%
CTE Center
 
03:13:59.210 --> 03:13:59.220 align:start position:0%
and now we're adding uh private and home
 
03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
school students to this
 
03:14:05.110 --> 03:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
group how does the school district
 
03:14:08.570 --> 03:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
determine who is going to be in that
 
03:14:12.170 --> 03:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
quota if they've got more students than
 
03:14:15.349 --> 03:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
the quota would allow sure uh great
 
03:14:19.910 --> 03:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
question uh it is actually up the um
 
03:14:22.790 --> 03:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
acceptance into a CTE Center
 
03:14:25.790 --> 03:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
is up to the CTE Center
 
03:14:29.210 --> 03:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
so uh and I'll I'll use Concord and bow
 
03:14:32.389 --> 03:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
we I use them all the time Bo represents
 
03:14:34.190 --> 03:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
say five percent of the this the
 
03:14:35.570 --> 03:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
populace the way it's determined is
 
03:14:38.870 --> 03:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
student population within the town
 
03:14:41.150 --> 03:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
and so let's say Bo represents five
 
03:14:42.650 --> 03:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
percent of the region
 
03:14:46.010 --> 03:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
so when Concord does their allocations
 
03:14:48.590 --> 03:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
they say there can be five percent of
 
03:14:50.870 --> 03:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
our seats in all of our programs
 
03:14:52.670 --> 03:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
dedicated to students
 
03:14:54.769 --> 03:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
who live in Bow
 
03:14:58.429 --> 03:14:58.439 align:start position:0%
now let's say that represents 75 seats
 
03:15:02.269 --> 03:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
it's very possible that 110 kids from Bo
 
03:15:04.130 --> 03:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
fill out applications and send them to
 
03:15:06.349 --> 03:15:06.359 align:start position:0%
Concord and that would include kids who
 
03:15:08.570 --> 03:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
are at Charter Schools and Etc but live
 
03:15:10.849 --> 03:15:10.859 align:start position:0%
in Bow and send them to Concord
 
03:15:14.330 --> 03:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
conquered decides which of the 75
 
03:15:17.630 --> 03:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
students actually fill the seats so it's
 
03:15:19.730 --> 03:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
not up to Beau to determine who which
 
03:15:22.070 --> 03:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
applications they can include and they
 
03:15:23.389 --> 03:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
send them all
 
03:15:26.510 --> 03:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
so so it's the CTA Center that basically
 
03:15:28.250 --> 03:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
basically makes the determination of
 
03:15:29.690 --> 03:15:29.700 align:start position:0%
which students are going to participate
 
03:15:31.969 --> 03:15:31.979 align:start position:0%
thanks that's a clarification I didn't
 
03:15:34.849 --> 03:15:34.859 align:start position:0%
realize so the next question I have is
 
03:15:36.830 --> 03:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
that dealing with the transportation
 
03:15:39.889 --> 03:15:39.899 align:start position:0%
costs yes that is
 
03:15:42.469 --> 03:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
um I know like in Hopkinton for example
 
03:15:45.410 --> 03:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
we've got a bus that takes students into
 
03:15:49.070 --> 03:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh the CTA Center in Concord how does
 
03:15:52.910 --> 03:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
that work if and I mean does a student
 
03:15:55.190 --> 03:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
from a particular residence School
 
03:15:58.309 --> 03:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
District do they then have to comply
 
03:16:01.550 --> 03:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
with what the transportation process is
 
03:16:04.550 --> 03:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
from that school district to the CTE
 
03:16:07.610 --> 03:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
Center or does the individual have a
 
03:16:09.950 --> 03:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
right to get there however they want to
 
03:16:12.110 --> 03:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
get there what's the procedure on that
 
03:16:14.630 --> 03:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
sure so if if they're attending say
 
03:16:16.429 --> 03:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton high school if that's the high
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
school they attend
 
03:16:20.750 --> 03:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
then they need then it's how their
 
03:16:22.910 --> 03:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
school district sends kids to the CTE
 
03:16:26.090 --> 03:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
Center many of the CTE Centers do not
 
03:16:27.830 --> 03:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
allow students to self-transport they
 
03:16:29.150 --> 03:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
don't have the parking space for it
 
03:16:31.429 --> 03:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
right this that which is why the school
 
03:16:33.889 --> 03:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
districts are providing buses and which
 
03:16:36.170 --> 03:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
is why the state is reimbursing the
 
03:16:37.910 --> 03:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
school districts because it's an
 
03:16:39.230 --> 03:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket expense for a school
 
03:16:40.429 --> 03:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
district that they wouldn't normally
 
03:16:43.309 --> 03:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
expend but there are some instances
 
03:16:46.490 --> 03:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
where uh both the CTE Center and the
 
03:16:48.530 --> 03:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
High School allow a student to
 
03:16:50.330 --> 03:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
self-transport they have in many
 
03:16:51.530 --> 03:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
instances they have to apply there has
 
03:16:53.590 --> 03:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
to be a specific reason for it
 
03:16:56.630 --> 03:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh but in which case the student can
 
03:16:58.610 --> 03:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
self-transport and then they are
 
03:17:01.370 --> 03:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
reimbursed that 25 cents per mile
 
03:17:03.590 --> 03:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
so just as a follow-up if I may one
 
03:17:06.650 --> 03:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
final let's use the example of a of a
 
03:17:06.660 --> 03:17:07.490 align:start position:0%
final let's use the example of a of a
student

03:17:07.490 --> 03:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
student
 
03:17:09.469 --> 03:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
let's say from Hopkinton
 
03:17:13.250 --> 03:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh that is going to uh the Tilton School
 
03:17:16.730 --> 03:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
in a private school okay and the signs
 
03:17:20.210 --> 03:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
that they want to attend a program as
 
03:17:22.389 --> 03:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
part of their as part of their education
 
03:17:27.650 --> 03:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
uh at the Concord CTA program how does
 
03:17:30.410 --> 03:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
the transportation from a residential
 
03:17:34.130 --> 03:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
student at Tilton to then come to the
 
03:17:36.590 --> 03:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
con the CTA and Concord how does that
 
03:17:38.330 --> 03:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
Transportation work
 
03:17:40.849 --> 03:17:40.859 align:start position:0%
so uh it you you actually ask a
 
03:17:41.990 --> 03:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
phenomenal question
 
03:17:43.730 --> 03:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
um we have um
 
03:17:46.610 --> 03:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
no I've I've never heard of of that
 
03:17:48.710 --> 03:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
specific situation
 
03:17:50.630 --> 03:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
um I I can tell you that any time we
 
03:17:52.610 --> 03:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
have had a private school student or a
 
03:17:54.230 --> 03:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
charter school student or a homeschool
 
03:17:56.450 --> 03:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
student they have self-transported
 
03:17:58.250 --> 03:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
whether it is a parent
 
03:18:00.110 --> 03:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
or it's you know the school has a van
 
03:18:03.469 --> 03:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
that drives them uh and uh so we've
 
03:18:05.570 --> 03:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
never heard of uh of a challenge
 
03:18:09.110 --> 03:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise uh we're happy to to try to
 
03:18:10.910 --> 03:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
help figure it out
 
03:18:13.309 --> 03:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
um but so far it hasn't happened
 
03:18:13.319 --> 03:18:14.150 align:start position:0%
um but so far it hasn't happened
um

03:18:14.150 --> 03:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:15.950 --> 03:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for that
 
03:18:15.960 --> 03:18:18.230 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for that
clarification

03:18:18.230 --> 03:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
03:18:20.210 --> 03:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock
 
03:18:22.010 --> 03:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Eric thanks for
 
03:18:23.630 --> 03:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question just it's a
 
03:18:26.630 --> 03:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
clarification on simple CTE uh protocol
 
03:18:28.730 --> 03:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
which I don't know the answer to
 
03:18:30.230 --> 03:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
um which I don't I don't know a lot of
 
03:18:32.510 --> 03:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
again so this is just another one uh on
 
03:18:34.969 --> 03:18:34.979 align:start position:0%
the CTE piece if a young I'm from Conway
 
03:18:37.730 --> 03:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
by the way okay youngster uh lives in
 
03:18:40.550 --> 03:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
Conway and wants to go to a CTE program
 
03:18:43.370 --> 03:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
we have a school here right it has a
 
03:18:46.610 --> 03:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
similar say uh a robotics program that
 
03:18:49.130 --> 03:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
we have do they have the choice to go to
 
03:18:51.889 --> 03:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
a different uh CTE or they obligated to
 
03:18:53.450 --> 03:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
stay in the one they have no great
 
03:18:56.870 --> 03:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
question they they do have a choice
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
however they will be an out of region
 
03:19:00.000 --> 03:19:01.130 align:start position:0%
however they will be an out of region
student

03:19:01.130 --> 03:19:01.140 align:start position:0%
student
 
03:19:02.990 --> 03:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
which means that they would be the last
 
03:19:07.130 --> 03:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
one to get a seat in the program so if
 
03:19:09.650 --> 03:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
they wanted to go to Laconia for the
 
03:19:12.410 --> 03:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
program in Laconia for example once
 
03:19:15.469 --> 03:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
Laconia fills all of its applicants from
 
03:19:18.170 --> 03:19:18.180 align:start position:0%
its assigned Regional centers if there
 
03:19:20.510 --> 03:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
are empty seats right now if there's
 
03:19:22.670 --> 03:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
empty seats students at Laconia High
 
03:19:23.990 --> 03:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
School typically fill those all those
 
03:19:26.269 --> 03:19:26.279 align:start position:0%
empty seats but there was an out of
 
03:19:28.670 --> 03:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
District student they would then be the
 
03:19:30.410 --> 03:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
next one in line to fill those seats
 
03:19:33.590 --> 03:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair FMA yes you may thank
 
03:19:37.010 --> 03:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
you um Eric to that question I lost you
 
03:19:38.990 --> 03:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
here oh there you go yeah you moved I do
 
03:19:41.330 --> 03:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
okay to that question
 
03:19:44.750 --> 03:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
um would the SAU 9 and where we live be
 
03:19:46.610 --> 03:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
responsible with Transportation since we
 
03:19:49.910 --> 03:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
have that program in our our SAU as well
 
03:19:49.920 --> 03:19:52.730 align:start position:0%
have that program in our our SAU as well
um

03:19:52.730 --> 03:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:52.740 --> 03:19:55.130 align:start position:0%
 
no

03:19:55.130 --> 03:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh because it is an out of region and
 
03:19:59.389 --> 03:19:59.399 align:start position:0%
out of
 
03:19:59.399 --> 03:20:02.710 align:start position:0%
out of
um

03:20:02.710 --> 03:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:05.330 --> 03:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
that student is opting
 
03:20:07.610 --> 03:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
on their own op to go out of that region
 
03:20:10.309 --> 03:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
so uh they would not be obligated to pay
 
03:20:11.929 --> 03:20:11.939 align:start position:0%
for the student
 
03:20:13.670 --> 03:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
um but again
 
03:20:13.680 --> 03:20:14.510 align:start position:0%
um but again
um

03:20:14.510 --> 03:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:16.370 --> 03:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
the legislation we're putting in right
 
03:20:18.410 --> 03:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
now there would ultimately be no
 
03:20:20.809 --> 03:20:20.819 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket expense for the school
 
03:20:22.309 --> 03:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh because they would be fully
 
03:20:24.050 --> 03:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for tuition rather than the
 
03:20:25.610 --> 03:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
10 cents per mile
 
03:20:25.620 --> 03:20:28.030 align:start position:0%
10 cents per mile
okay

03:20:28.030 --> 03:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:20:31.969 --> 03:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
because the student made their own
 
03:20:33.469 --> 03:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
personal decision to go to a different
 
03:20:35.690 --> 03:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
school okay thanks again appreciate it
 
03:20:36.889 --> 03:20:36.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:20:38.210 --> 03:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
but thank you for bringing up great
 
03:20:38.220 --> 03:20:39.889 align:start position:0%
but thank you for bringing up great
questions

03:20:39.889 --> 03:20:39.899 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:20:41.929 --> 03:20:41.939 align:start position:0%
Eric I think we need some clarification
 
03:20:44.150 --> 03:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
too because you're saying fully full
 
03:20:45.830 --> 03:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
cost of Transportation will be
 
03:20:48.950 --> 03:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursed uh you presented the council
 
03:20:51.590 --> 03:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
several years ago or even the commission
 
03:20:55.370 --> 03:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
that an FY 20 uh Transportation costs
 
03:20:59.750 --> 03:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
that were reimbursed were 680 000 of
 
03:21:02.809 --> 03:21:02.819 align:start position:0%
which the actual costs were 2.6 million
 
03:21:07.070 --> 03:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
dollars yes so this is going to end up
 
03:21:10.250 --> 03:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
with a significant increase in in
 
03:21:14.290 --> 03:21:14.300 align:start position:0%
finances with what we're proposing here
 
03:21:17.809 --> 03:21:17.819 align:start position:0%
uh yes and no
 
03:21:20.750 --> 03:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
um it moved the money from one column to
 
03:21:23.030 --> 03:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
another uh currently there is nine
 
03:21:25.610 --> 03:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
million dollars allocated for tuition
 
03:21:27.349 --> 03:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
and transportation
 
03:21:29.410 --> 03:21:29.420 align:start position:0%
the way the law is written
 
03:21:32.090 --> 03:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
transportation is paid first
 
03:21:35.389 --> 03:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
and then whatever is left is divided by
 
03:21:38.389 --> 03:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
the number of students attending CTE to
 
03:21:40.969 --> 03:21:40.979 align:start position:0%
cover up to 75 percent of the tuition
 
03:21:40.979 --> 03:21:42.950 align:start position:0%
cover up to 75 percent of the tuition
costs

03:21:42.950 --> 03:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:21:47.929 --> 03:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
so yes that is correct Eric but that's
 
03:21:50.210 --> 03:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
just taking from one pot distilled nine
 
03:21:52.670 --> 03:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars allocated each year
 
03:21:55.670 --> 03:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
and we're now going to take out of that
 
03:21:57.950 --> 03:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
and throw the tuition money which is
 
03:22:01.010 --> 03:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
75.25 over to the other side of the coin
 
03:22:03.889 --> 03:22:03.899 align:start position:0%
so they're going to re receive
 
03:22:05.389 --> 03:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
in in
 
03:22:07.670 --> 03:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
actuality the same amount of money it's
 
03:22:11.710 --> 03:22:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:14.150 --> 03:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
but they're not going to receive the
 
03:22:16.490 --> 03:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
full tuition amount
 
03:22:18.590 --> 03:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
I see this we're going to have to if
 
03:22:20.389 --> 03:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to do full funding we're
 
03:22:21.950 --> 03:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
going to have to fully fund the
 
03:22:23.750 --> 03:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
difference which is about two million
 
03:22:26.750 --> 03:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
dollars I I could not agree with you
 
03:22:30.710 --> 03:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
more representative and uh during the
 
03:22:32.510 --> 03:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee hearings this was
 
03:22:36.050 --> 03:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
presented uh and that conversation did
 
03:22:38.630 --> 03:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
come up around increasing the TNT
 
03:22:40.790 --> 03:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
allotment by at least two million
 
03:22:40.800 --> 03:22:42.230 align:start position:0%
allotment by at least two million
dollars

03:22:42.230 --> 03:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:22:44.990 --> 03:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
and uh I do not know where that stands I
 
03:22:47.210 --> 03:22:47.220 align:start position:0%
I do not believe there was a motion to
 
03:22:48.889 --> 03:22:48.899 align:start position:0%
increase that amount but that was the
 
03:22:51.170 --> 03:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
request well I see representative Heath
 
03:22:53.210 --> 03:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
here maybe she can help us out
 
03:22:56.389 --> 03:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
yes thank thank you chairman lad um
 
03:22:59.809 --> 03:22:59.819 align:start position:0%
during our negotiations in division two
 
03:23:04.610 --> 03:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
about TNT we actually wanted to raise it
 
03:23:08.330 --> 03:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
um but the question I believe from the
 
03:23:12.349 --> 03:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
doe was that if we raise that amount in
 
03:23:14.870 --> 03:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
the level of Maintenance of effort you
 
03:23:18.410 --> 03:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
would have trouble meeting that in the
 
03:23:21.349 --> 03:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
following years so that's why we ended
 
03:23:23.809 --> 03:23:23.819 align:start position:0%
up not increasing because we had talked
 
03:23:26.690 --> 03:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
about raising the T because we wanted to
 
03:23:29.150 --> 03:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
get it funded to the level that it
 
03:23:31.910 --> 03:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
should be funded can you give me any
 
03:23:35.030 --> 03:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
information on that uh the at you are
 
03:23:36.410 --> 03:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
correct that that was the question to me
 
03:23:39.410 --> 03:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
was uh would this uh the maintenance of
 
03:23:42.290 --> 03:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
effort and I I said it would and it
 
03:23:43.670 --> 03:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
would raise the maintenance of effort in
 
03:23:46.670 --> 03:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
perpetuity so the concern that I
 
03:23:48.889 --> 03:23:48.899 align:start position:0%
understood that came back from Finance
 
03:23:48.899 --> 03:23:50.570 align:start position:0%
understood that came back from Finance
was

03:23:50.570 --> 03:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:23:52.729 --> 03:23:52.739 align:start position:0%
we would putting the state in a position
 
03:23:56.570 --> 03:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
of me basically requiring them to keep
 
03:23:58.670 --> 03:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
it at that new higher level moving
 
03:24:00.830 --> 03:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
forward and the committee wasn't sure
 
03:24:03.309 --> 03:24:03.319 align:start position:0%
they could lock themselves into
 
03:24:06.769 --> 03:24:06.779 align:start position:0%
requiring a future budget to keep it at
 
03:24:08.809 --> 03:24:08.819 align:start position:0%
that new elevated 11 million if I
 
03:24:11.630 --> 03:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
remember correctly and so we we left it
 
03:24:14.809 --> 03:24:14.819 align:start position:0%
at the um the rate that we had
 
03:24:16.790 --> 03:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
established initially for that reason
 
03:24:19.969 --> 03:24:19.979 align:start position:0%
because we didn't want to
 
03:24:22.610 --> 03:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
um cause a hardship in terms of
 
03:24:25.070 --> 03:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
Maintenance of effort you know whether
 
03:24:26.330 --> 03:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
or not there was going to be future
 
03:24:26.340 --> 03:24:27.710 align:start position:0%
or not there was going to be future
funding

03:24:27.710 --> 03:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
funding
 
03:24:29.870 --> 03:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
um but it's disappointing that we
 
03:24:31.670 --> 03:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't raise that level because I
 
03:24:33.710 --> 03:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
think there there is an issue because it
 
03:24:35.450 --> 03:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
ends up getting prorated across the
 
03:24:35.460 --> 03:24:36.229 align:start position:0%
ends up getting prorated across the
state

03:24:36.229 --> 03:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:24:36.239 --> 03:24:39.590 align:start position:0%
state
yes

03:24:39.590 --> 03:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:41.650 --> 03:24:41.660 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
03:24:44.090 --> 03:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
and that's yeah
 
03:24:46.190 --> 03:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
it's not helping and then if we add
 
03:24:48.410 --> 03:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
Nashua Exeter
 
03:24:50.570 --> 03:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
in Manchester into the transportation
 
03:24:54.229 --> 03:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
pot uh obviously uh if we're going to
 
03:24:56.330 --> 03:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
maintain the policy that we all believe
 
03:24:58.250 --> 03:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
in there's going to have to be some
 
03:25:01.550 --> 03:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
matching dollars to support that policy
 
03:25:04.010 --> 03:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh Eric do you have anything else for us
 
03:25:06.769 --> 03:25:06.779 align:start position:0%
on on this these changes
 
03:25:08.870 --> 03:25:08.880 align:start position:0%

other
 
03:25:17.990 --> 03:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
um technical edits to put in which I
 
03:25:20.330 --> 03:25:20.340 align:start position:0%

well so uh just to let you know with
 
03:25:32.450 --> 03:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
regard to The Outdoor Rec piece uh CTE
 
03:25:34.849 --> 03:25:34.859 align:start position:0%
is already working on the inclusion of
 
03:25:37.370 --> 03:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
outdoor represent outdoor uh Recreation
 
03:25:39.590 --> 03:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
management as programs and competencies
 
03:25:41.750 --> 03:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
within our program so
 
03:25:43.190 --> 03:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
um so the request that's in the
 
03:25:45.710 --> 03:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
legislation for us to present on it in
 
03:25:48.290 --> 03:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
2022 we will not have any concerns with
 
03:25:52.250 --> 03:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:54.290 --> 03:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much Eric and have a

thank you you all too
 
03:26:00.769 --> 03:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
uh do we have anybody else that wants to
 
03:26:03.349 --> 03:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
talk on this part because of the other
 
03:26:04.790 --> 03:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
parts we're gonna have to wind up a
 
03:26:06.710 --> 03:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
little bit after we
 
03:26:12.110 --> 03:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:15.650 --> 03:26:15.660 align:start position:0%
okay so we we have basically done this
 
03:26:17.809 --> 03:26:17.819 align:start position:0%
second part
 
03:26:17.819 --> 03:26:20.090 align:start position:0%
second part
um

03:26:20.090 --> 03:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:22.910 --> 03:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh and we there are five charts this
 
03:26:25.190 --> 03:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
bill uh I don't believe we've talked
 
03:26:28.729 --> 03:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
about the uh Vocational Rehabilitation
 
03:26:31.429 --> 03:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
which is part one
 
03:26:36.670 --> 03:26:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh nor are we we got into police
 
03:26:40.070 --> 03:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
part three and part five
 
03:26:43.729 --> 03:26:43.739 align:start position:0%
and and uh I believe Dave Waters talked
 
03:26:47.269 --> 03:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
about the part five you know
 
03:26:50.210 --> 03:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
what store was it let's see no nobody's
 
03:26:51.889 --> 03:26:51.899 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
03:26:53.809 --> 03:26:53.819 align:start position:0%
our 40th
 
03:26:57.889 --> 03:26:57.899 align:start position:0%
oh except uh Senator Waters he just
 
03:27:00.110 --> 03:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
introduced it
 
03:27:00.120 --> 03:27:01.429 align:start position:0%
introduced it
so

03:27:01.429 --> 03:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:27:01.439 --> 03:27:02.210 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:27:02.210 --> 03:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:05.030 --> 03:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
we can keep driving through this thing
 
03:27:07.070 --> 03:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
um but or we can take a half hour break
 
03:27:09.110 --> 03:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
what are what's the uh
 
03:27:10.849 --> 03:27:10.859 align:start position:0%

the Department of Education
 
03:28:29.450 --> 03:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
03:28:31.849 --> 03:28:31.859 align:start position:0%

03:28:34.429 --> 03:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
uh for allowing me to speak um I did
 
03:28:36.469 --> 03:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
sign up this morning I apologize for not
 
03:28:38.809 --> 03:28:38.819 align:start position:0%
being on the roster earlier
 
03:28:40.849 --> 03:28:40.859 align:start position:0%
um what I did wanted to say in terms of
 
03:28:42.769 --> 03:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
part one is that vocational
 
03:28:46.250 --> 03:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation uh has been undergoing a
 
03:28:49.790 --> 03:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
whole host of changes and one of those
 
03:28:52.910 --> 03:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh has been updating our administrative
 
03:28:55.849 --> 03:28:55.859 align:start position:0%
rules and as we reviewed our
 
03:28:58.309 --> 03:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
administrative rules through both
 
03:29:01.370 --> 03:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
internal review as well as a legislative
 
03:29:04.849 --> 03:29:04.859 align:start position:0%
budget assistant internal audit this
 
03:29:07.070 --> 03:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
last couple years there were several
 
03:29:09.229 --> 03:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
areas of our administrative rules that
 
03:29:13.130 --> 03:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
were identified needing update and so we
 
03:29:16.910 --> 03:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
were able to update those and what you
 
03:29:20.750 --> 03:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
see in in the language in this bill are
 
03:29:23.450 --> 03:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
some areas that we needed to repeal and
 
03:29:26.450 --> 03:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
the primary reason for that is that
 
03:29:29.269 --> 03:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
either they're no longer administered by
 
03:29:31.790 --> 03:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
the program and administered by some
 
03:29:34.849 --> 03:29:34.859 align:start position:0%
other party or they're just not programs
 
03:29:37.729 --> 03:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
that are available any longer and so
 
03:29:40.790 --> 03:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
that is uh that is the reason for that
 
03:29:43.190 --> 03:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
language within the bill and I would
 
03:29:44.450 --> 03:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
certainly be willing to take any
 
03:29:47.690 --> 03:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone has uh on any part
 
03:29:49.849 --> 03:29:49.859 align:start position:0%
in there
 
03:29:51.729 --> 03:29:51.739 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Miss hatch is

um thank you very much are there any
 
03:30:00.530 --> 03:30:00.540 align:start position:0%
questions regarding part one now
 
03:30:02.330 --> 03:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like it's an administ
 
03:30:04.550 --> 03:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
administrative changes to try and get
 
03:30:04.560 --> 03:30:05.450 align:start position:0%
administrative changes to try and get
current

03:30:05.450 --> 03:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
current
 
03:30:05.460 --> 03:30:06.650 align:start position:0%
current
yep

03:30:06.650 --> 03:30:06.660 align:start position:0%
yep
 
03:30:06.660 --> 03:30:08.389 align:start position:0%
yep

03:30:23.760 --> 03:30:28.809 align:start position:0%
 
IES

03:30:28.809 --> 03:30:28.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:31.130 --> 03:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
I can see I don't think we have taken
 
03:30:33.950 --> 03:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
questions on part three
 
03:30:36.590 --> 03:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
so are there any is there anybody out
 
03:30:40.309 --> 03:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
there in the attendee list that would
 
03:30:45.170 --> 03:30:45.180 align:start position:0%
like to testify on part three of SB 148
 
03:30:49.670 --> 03:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
if so would you please raise your hand
 
03:30:52.250 --> 03:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
Mr chair maybe I hope we do have someone
 
03:30:53.750 --> 03:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
I was going to say maybe it would be
 
03:30:56.450 --> 03:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
helpful to talk about the content of the
 
03:30:59.210 --> 03:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
building the sports injuries
 
03:31:10.010 --> 03:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:14.870 --> 03:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:17.570 --> 03:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
hello there can you all hear me yes we
 
03:31:19.370 --> 03:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
can okay
 
03:31:22.490 --> 03:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
well um good afternoon honorable members
 
03:31:23.870 --> 03:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you for having me
 
03:31:25.490 --> 03:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
today I'm excited
 
03:31:26.570 --> 03:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
um to be here with you to talk about
 
03:31:28.550 --> 03:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:31:30.290 --> 03:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
um as you already heard my name is
 
03:31:33.290 --> 03:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
Rebecca Stearns I am the CEO of the
 
03:31:35.150 --> 03:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
Corey Stringer Institute and I'm here
 
03:31:37.550 --> 03:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
today representing the institute's full
 
03:31:39.590 --> 03:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
support for part three of SB 148
 
03:31:42.410 --> 03:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
emergency action plans for sports so the
 
03:31:42.420 --> 03:31:43.250 align:start position:0%
emergency action plans for sports so the
mission

03:31:43.250 --> 03:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
mission
 
03:31:45.410 --> 03:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
um of the Corey Stringer Institute is to
 
03:31:47.450 --> 03:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
provide research education advocacy and
 
03:31:49.849 --> 03:31:49.859 align:start position:0%
consultation for to maximize performance
 
03:31:52.490 --> 03:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
optimize safety and ultimately prevent
 
03:31:54.050 --> 03:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
Sun death for the athlete war fighter
 
03:31:55.550 --> 03:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
and labor and so our goal is to reduce
 
03:31:58.130 --> 03:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
catastrophic injuries related to the top
 
03:32:00.229 --> 03:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
causes of death and there are four
 
03:32:02.110 --> 03:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
conditions that really make up over 90
 
03:32:04.429 --> 03:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
of the sudden deaths that we see in
 
03:32:04.439 --> 03:32:05.570 align:start position:0%
of the sudden deaths that we see in
athletes

03:32:05.570 --> 03:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
athletes
 
03:32:07.450 --> 03:32:07.460 align:start position:0%
and this includes Cardiac Arrest
 
03:32:10.010 --> 03:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
exertional heat stroke traumatic head
 
03:32:12.170 --> 03:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
injuries and exertional sickling and
 
03:32:13.849 --> 03:32:13.859 align:start position:0%
just those four do make up 90 of the
 
03:32:15.229 --> 03:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
deaths that we see
 
03:32:16.910 --> 03:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
and so if you look at the years between
 
03:32:20.210 --> 03:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
or the five years between 2015 and 2019
 
03:32:23.690 --> 03:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
we lost about 335 athletes high school
 
03:32:27.290 --> 03:32:27.300 align:start position:0%
athletes lives in the U.S just to these
 
03:32:29.809 --> 03:32:29.819 align:start position:0%
sudden cardiac or sudden events
 
03:32:32.929 --> 03:32:32.939 align:start position:0%
and so it even though we did lose those
 
03:32:34.610 --> 03:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
athletes we do believe that through
 
03:32:37.130 --> 03:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
State policy requirements we are
 
03:32:38.630 --> 03:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
confident that more athletes can go home
 
03:32:40.309 --> 03:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
to their families and their parents at
 
03:32:42.110 --> 03:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
the end of the night so this bill
 
03:32:44.570 --> 03:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
specifically enacts five vital health
 
03:32:47.030 --> 03:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
and safety components that benefit the
 
03:32:48.530 --> 03:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
high school athletes in the state of New
 
03:32:49.729 --> 03:32:49.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I'm just going to go
 
03:32:52.250 --> 03:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
through those very briefly the first
 
03:32:54.170 --> 03:32:54.180 align:start position:0%
um is mandating emergency action plans
 
03:32:56.750 --> 03:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
and so just alone having an emergency
 
03:32:59.389 --> 03:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
action plan and a plan in place when a
 
03:33:01.550 --> 03:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
catastrophic injury does happen improves
 
03:33:04.630 --> 03:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
the survival of cardiac events by 35
 
03:33:07.010 --> 03:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
and so part of having an emergency
 
03:33:08.809 --> 03:33:08.819 align:start position:0%
action plan also includes other
 
03:33:10.610 --> 03:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
components which are supported by this
 
03:33:13.510 --> 03:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
bill one of them being outlining the
 
03:33:16.610 --> 03:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
automated external defibrillator access
 
03:33:19.370 --> 03:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
and we know that each year one in 36
 
03:33:20.990 --> 03:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
high schools will have a student who
 
03:33:23.330 --> 03:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
suffers a cardiac arrest and survival
 
03:33:25.849 --> 03:33:25.859 align:start position:0%
rates are currently around 54 at the
 
03:33:27.410 --> 03:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
high school level for athletes who
 
03:33:30.170 --> 03:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
suffer Cardiac Arrest however in cases
 
03:33:32.570 --> 03:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
where there is an AED and it's used we
 
03:33:34.550 --> 03:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
know that the survival rate is is as
 
03:33:37.309 --> 03:33:37.319 align:start position:0%
high as 89 percent
 
03:33:39.830 --> 03:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
and then another policy included in the
 
03:33:41.450 --> 03:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
bill would be related to having a
 
03:33:43.370 --> 03:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
Weather policy and specifically a wet
 
03:33:46.429 --> 03:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
bulb Globe temperature policy and this
 
03:33:49.269 --> 03:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
policy has resulted in over 35 percent
 
03:33:52.429 --> 03:33:52.439 align:start position:0%
reduction in heat exhaustion cases when
 
03:33:54.830 --> 03:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
it is mandated
 
03:33:57.050 --> 03:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
a heat acclimatization policy is also
 
03:33:59.269 --> 03:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
included and we've seen where a heat
 
03:34:01.130 --> 03:34:01.140 align:start position:0%
acclimatization policy is mandated and
 
03:34:03.469 --> 03:34:03.479 align:start position:0%
it's provided a 55 reduction in heat
 
03:34:03.479 --> 03:34:04.910 align:start position:0%
it's provided a 55 reduction in heat
illnesses

03:34:04.910 --> 03:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
illnesses
 
03:34:07.490 --> 03:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
and lastly it includes Provisions for a
 
03:34:09.830 --> 03:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
cold water immersion policy we know that
 
03:34:12.590 --> 03:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
cold water immersion can save 100 of the
 
03:34:13.969 --> 03:34:13.979 align:start position:0%
heat stroke victims when it's applied
 
03:34:16.670 --> 03:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
within 15 minutes
 
03:34:19.070 --> 03:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
so all of these are established best
 
03:34:20.450 --> 03:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
practices and policies that are
 
03:34:22.370 --> 03:34:22.380 align:start position:0%
supported by Leading sport health and
 
03:34:23.929 --> 03:34:23.939 align:start position:0%
safety organizations such as the
 
03:34:25.330 --> 03:34:25.340 align:start position:0%
national athletic trainers Association
 
03:34:27.349 --> 03:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
and the American College of sports
 
03:34:27.359 --> 03:34:28.309 align:start position:0%
and the American College of sports
medicine

03:34:28.309 --> 03:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
03:34:30.769 --> 03:34:30.779 align:start position:0%
there are over 120 schools in New
 
03:34:32.630 --> 03:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we know that about 42
 
03:34:34.429 --> 03:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
percent of those are almost 9 000
 
03:34:36.349 --> 03:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
students don't have access to an
 
03:34:38.389 --> 03:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
athletic trainer and this is the typical
 
03:34:40.190 --> 03:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
medical provider who creates and
 
03:34:42.110 --> 03:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
implements these policies so it makes it
 
03:34:44.269 --> 03:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
that much more vital to have these laws
 
03:34:46.070 --> 03:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
to ensure basic health and safety policy
 
03:34:48.650 --> 03:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
is implemented for all athletes
 
03:34:51.050 --> 03:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
so even even for those schools that do
 
03:34:52.670 --> 03:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
have athletic trainers we do know that
 
03:34:55.490 --> 03:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
gaps in these policies still exist our
 
03:34:56.990 --> 03:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
most recent survey showed that there are
 
03:34:58.910 --> 03:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
almost 4 000 New Hampshire athletes at a
 
03:35:00.710 --> 03:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
school with an athletic trainer but
 
03:35:02.389 --> 03:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
there's no established emergency action
 
03:35:05.450 --> 03:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
plan so that obviously is why this bill
 
03:35:07.790 --> 03:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
could allow for equal health and safety
 
03:35:09.530 --> 03:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
protection across all athletes in the
 
03:35:13.309 --> 03:35:13.319 align:start position:0%
state so it is our hope that through the
 
03:35:14.690 --> 03:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
continued adoption of best practices
 
03:35:17.269 --> 03:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
we'll continue to see reductions in the
 
03:35:20.030 --> 03:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
senseless sport related deaths so each
 
03:35:21.469 --> 03:35:21.479 align:start position:0%
of the topic areas that I've addressed
 
03:35:23.929 --> 03:35:23.939 align:start position:0%
today are currently legislated in at
 
03:35:26.450 --> 03:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
least one or more other states for
 
03:35:28.729 --> 03:35:28.739 align:start position:0%
example seven states have legislation
 
03:35:30.469 --> 03:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
that every school in their state have an
 
03:35:32.809 --> 03:35:32.819 align:start position:0%
emergency action plan 15 other states
 
03:35:35.389 --> 03:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
have language to support aeds in
 
03:35:37.849 --> 03:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
athletic venues nine of which were
 
03:35:39.290 --> 03:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
adopted just in the last five years
 
03:35:39.300 --> 03:35:40.849 align:start position:0%
adopted just in the last five years
alone

03:35:40.849 --> 03:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
alone
 
03:35:43.490 --> 03:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
and I just like to point out that in
 
03:35:45.349 --> 03:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
addition if this still if this bill does
 
03:35:47.389 --> 03:35:47.399 align:start position:0%
pass the Corey Stringer Institute is
 
03:35:49.490 --> 03:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
part of its grant program that is
 
03:35:50.690 --> 03:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
sponsored by the national athletic
 
03:35:53.090 --> 03:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
trainers Association and the NFL we'll
 
03:35:54.590 --> 03:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
be coordinating a meeting in New
 
03:35:56.929 --> 03:35:56.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with leaders
 
03:35:59.030 --> 03:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
um that are responsible for high school
 
03:36:01.370 --> 03:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
sport health and safety to compile and
 
03:36:03.050 --> 03:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
prepare all the resources to help
 
03:36:04.969 --> 03:36:04.979 align:start position:0%
support successful implementation of
 
03:36:06.650 --> 03:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
these policies
 
03:36:09.349 --> 03:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
so adopting this bill would provide
 
03:36:11.870 --> 03:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
necessary and basic policies to ensure
 
03:36:14.450 --> 03:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
that no other athletes lives are
 
03:36:16.130 --> 03:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
needlessly lost
 
03:36:18.050 --> 03:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
so thank you again for your attention
 
03:36:20.510 --> 03:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
today I'd be happy to answer any
 
03:36:20.520 --> 03:36:21.950 align:start position:0%
today I'd be happy to answer any
questions

03:36:21.950 --> 03:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:36:23.870 --> 03:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
thanks very much for your testimony are
 
03:36:23.880 --> 03:36:24.710 align:start position:0%

there
 
03:36:28.070 --> 03:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
03:36:29.929 --> 03:36:29.939 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
03:36:34.250 --> 03:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:36.090 --> 03:36:36.100 align:start position:0%
do we have
 
03:36:36.100 --> 03:36:49.309 align:start position:0%
do we have
[Music]

03:36:49.309 --> 03:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:49.319 --> 03:36:52.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:36:52.849 --> 03:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:52.859 --> 03:37:27.349 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:37:27.349 --> 03:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:27.359 --> 03:37:29.630 align:start position:0%
 
hello

03:37:29.630 --> 03:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
hello
 
03:37:32.809 --> 03:37:32.819 align:start position:0%
yeah hi good afternoon thank you
 
03:37:34.250 --> 03:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
committee for uh for allowing me to
 
03:37:37.610 --> 03:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
speak on this topic of uh SB 148.
 
03:37:39.889 --> 03:37:39.899 align:start position:0%
um as I've been an athletic trainer um
 
03:37:42.349 --> 03:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
for uh several years um I'm the
 
03:37:43.610 --> 03:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
president-elect of the State of New
 
03:37:43.620 --> 03:37:44.809 align:start position:0%
president-elect of the State of New
Hampshire

03:37:44.809 --> 03:37:44.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:37:47.389 --> 03:37:47.399 align:start position:0%
um and I wanted to speak on this in a
 
03:37:49.010 --> 03:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
couple of different aspects uh number
 
03:37:51.469 --> 03:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
one uh having dealt with a lot of uh
 
03:37:53.690 --> 03:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
severe injuries and things uh that have
 
03:37:56.990 --> 03:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
come up in my career both Collegiate and
 
03:37:58.309 --> 03:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
high school
 
03:38:00.889 --> 03:38:00.899 align:start position:0%
um I see that knowing having people know
 
03:38:03.830 --> 03:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
where to go what to do how to react
 
03:38:05.389 --> 03:38:05.399 align:start position:0%
um is a major thing and it helps to
 
03:38:07.490 --> 03:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
prevent as you as as was mentioned
 
03:38:07.500 --> 03:38:08.630 align:start position:0%
prevent as you as as was mentioned
earlier

03:38:08.630 --> 03:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
03:38:10.309 --> 03:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
um some severe injuries and different
 
03:38:12.590 --> 03:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
things that happen my point that I want
 
03:38:14.210 --> 03:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
to speak on this comes to the point
 
03:38:16.790 --> 03:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
where if we can get this passed I want
 
03:38:18.769 --> 03:38:18.779 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it's very well known
 
03:38:21.290 --> 03:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
that we need to not drop the ball after
 
03:38:23.570 --> 03:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
it's passed and after schools go ahead
 
03:38:26.269 --> 03:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
and write these policies that they make
 
03:38:29.090 --> 03:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
sure that these policies are readdressed
 
03:38:32.150 --> 03:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know yearly or in a timely manner
 
03:38:33.950 --> 03:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
because I can see that things get
 
03:38:36.229 --> 03:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
written addressed that we always change
 
03:38:37.729 --> 03:38:37.739 align:start position:0%
we have different coaches we have
 
03:38:38.990 --> 03:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
different athletic trainers we have
 
03:38:40.670 --> 03:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
different administrators and they all
 
03:38:43.429 --> 03:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
come through and if it's not addressed
 
03:38:45.469 --> 03:38:45.479 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis I think things get
 
03:38:45.479 --> 03:38:46.610 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis I think things get
lost

03:38:46.610 --> 03:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
lost
 
03:38:48.469 --> 03:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
um and it's as simple as as people
 
03:38:50.630 --> 03:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
knowing that you stand at the end of X
 
03:38:53.690 --> 03:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
Road and have somebody there waving down
 
03:38:55.010 --> 03:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
the ambulance to point them in the
 
03:38:57.290 --> 03:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
direction to where they need to go
 
03:38:59.570 --> 03:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
um so on that point that I mean that's
 
03:39:01.490 --> 03:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
my main point is yes I'd love to see the
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
bill pass I think it'll be a huge uh
 
03:39:06.050 --> 03:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
Plus for the State of New Hampshire for
 
03:39:08.330 --> 03:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
the Athletics Association things like
 
03:39:10.010 --> 03:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
that but I want to make sure that we
 
03:39:13.309 --> 03:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
stay on top of it to be able to allow
 
03:39:15.590 --> 03:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
um schools to regulate and make sure
 
03:39:17.750 --> 03:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
that as you change coaches as you change
 
03:39:19.910 --> 03:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
people they are aware of it and that's
 
03:39:22.190 --> 03:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
part of their normal procedure of moving
 
03:39:22.200 --> 03:39:23.269 align:start position:0%
part of their normal procedure of moving
in

03:39:23.269 --> 03:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:39:25.370 --> 03:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
um it's just as important it is to learn
 
03:39:27.229 --> 03:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
your team and and learn all the
 
03:39:28.370 --> 03:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
different administrative things that
 
03:39:30.290 --> 03:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
happen at a school you need to learn
 
03:39:31.910 --> 03:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
that there's an emergency action plan
 
03:39:33.950 --> 03:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
and you need to be a part of it in order
 
03:39:35.750 --> 03:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
to make it a success I don't want to
 
03:39:37.130 --> 03:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
take up any more time I know that you
 
03:39:38.570 --> 03:39:38.580 align:start position:0%

03:39:39.950 --> 03:39:39.960 align:start position:0%

members so again thank you for the
 
03:42:14.870 --> 03:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak in support of
 
03:42:18.889 --> 03:42:18.899 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 148 part uh part four as you
 
03:42:20.990 --> 03:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
know the existing law authorizes the
 
03:42:22.550 --> 03:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to the licensed
 
03:42:24.050 --> 03:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
businesses that provide occupational
 
03:42:27.469 --> 03:42:27.479 align:start position:0%
Training importantly the the licenses do
 
03:42:29.330 --> 03:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
not necessarily apply to every business
 
03:42:30.950 --> 03:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
in the state that offers skills
 
03:42:33.170 --> 03:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
instruction or Advanced education but
 
03:42:34.910 --> 03:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
rather programs that are occupational in
 
03:42:37.670 --> 03:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
nature late last year for the first time
 
03:42:39.710 --> 03:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
the department began began requiring
 
03:42:41.750 --> 03:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
some yoga providers who offer advanced
 
03:42:44.389 --> 03:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
yoga programs which are sometimes known
 
03:42:46.070 --> 03:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
in the yoga Community as quote unquote
 
03:42:48.170 --> 03:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
yoga teacher trainings to become
 
03:42:50.570 --> 03:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
licensed this raised two concerns for
 
03:42:52.130 --> 03:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
our small business members
 
03:42:54.290 --> 03:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
first the licensure requirements and
 
03:42:56.990 --> 03:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
fees were were undulube burdened to
 
03:42:58.610 --> 03:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
small businesses especially in a time of
 
03:43:01.370 --> 03:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
covet divorce and second yoga programs
 
03:43:02.990 --> 03:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
in this case have been mischaracterized
 
03:43:05.870 --> 03:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
as career schools we we yoga lines
 
03:43:07.070 --> 03:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
brought these concerns to the department
 
03:43:08.630 --> 03:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
and we very much appreciate their
 
03:43:10.910 --> 03:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
dialogue through that dialogue and our
 
03:43:12.830 --> 03:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
discussions we learned that a primary
 
03:43:14.570 --> 03:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
concern of the Departments is consumer
 
03:43:16.969 --> 03:43:16.979 align:start position:0%
protection meaning ensuring that
 
03:43:18.710 --> 03:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
individuals who enroll in and spend
 
03:43:20.809 --> 03:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
money on certain kinds of programs would
 
03:43:22.790 --> 03:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
be protected if a school can't or
 
03:43:25.250 --> 03:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't deliver for some reason we
 
03:43:26.750 --> 03:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
certainly agree with the need to protect
 
03:43:28.729 --> 03:43:28.739 align:start position:0%
consumers and as such of course we
 
03:43:30.769 --> 03:43:30.779 align:start position:0%
support Senate Bill 148 because the
 
03:43:32.570 --> 03:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
legislation squarely addresses the
 
03:43:34.550 --> 03:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
concerns of the yoga Community broadly
 
03:43:37.190 --> 03:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
of small businesses and as we understand
 
03:43:39.710 --> 03:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
it of the department first the
 
03:43:41.210 --> 03:43:41.220 align:start position:0%
legislation exempts those small
 
03:43:43.190 --> 03:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
businesses with an annual birth tuition
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
of 100 000 or less from licensure
 
03:43:47.990 --> 03:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
requirements we understand that this
 
03:43:49.550 --> 03:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
exemption is supported by officials in
 
03:43:51.410 --> 03:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
the department and reflects and we feel
 
03:43:53.570 --> 03:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
it reflects the burden of licensure on
 
03:43:55.790 --> 03:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
small businesses and second the
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
legislation exempts instructional
 
03:43:58.910 --> 03:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
programs for teaching Fitness and
 
03:44:01.010 --> 03:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
recreational Wellness but also provides
 
03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
that any entity with a gross annual
 
03:44:04.849 --> 03:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
income of over one hundred thousand
 
03:44:06.889 --> 03:44:06.899 align:start position:0%
dollars from those programs would obtain
 
03:44:09.170 --> 03:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
a surety bond this provision recognizes
 
03:44:11.090 --> 03:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
legitimate consumer protection concerns
 
03:44:13.370 --> 03:44:13.380 align:start position:0%
by requiring those large yoga programs
 
03:44:15.469 --> 03:44:15.479 align:start position:0%
to obtain a surety bond just like all
 
03:44:16.790 --> 03:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
the other programs licensed by the
 
03:44:16.800 --> 03:44:17.990 align:start position:0%
the other programs licensed by the
department

03:44:17.990 --> 03:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:44:19.849 --> 03:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
but at the same time the provision
 
03:44:22.070 --> 03:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
recognizes that advanced yoga classes
 
03:44:24.650 --> 03:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
are not in fact career schools while
 
03:44:26.090 --> 03:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
these advanced classes as I mentioned
 
03:44:28.010 --> 03:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
are often called teacher trainings in
 
03:44:30.050 --> 03:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
our community the name is somewhat of a
 
03:44:31.729 --> 03:44:31.739 align:start position:0%
misnomer because the classes are not
 
03:44:31.739 --> 03:44:32.590 align:start position:0%
misnomer because the classes are not
actually

03:44:32.590 --> 03:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:44:34.969 --> 03:44:34.979 align:start position:0%
prerequisite for teaching yoga to others
 
03:44:37.309 --> 03:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
and because most individuals by their
 
03:44:40.190 --> 03:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
own sort of reporting participate in
 
03:44:41.570 --> 03:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
these programs to deepen their personal
 
03:44:43.729 --> 03:44:43.739 align:start position:0%
practice or to practice yoga in a group
 
03:44:46.370 --> 03:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
setting and I'll just take one 30
 
03:44:48.950 --> 03:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
seconds to help maybe understand what I
 
03:44:50.210 --> 03:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
mean by deepening one's personal
 
03:44:52.370 --> 03:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
practice it's a little bit of a term of
 
03:44:53.870 --> 03:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
Art in our community
 
03:44:56.570 --> 03:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
so just to help sort of set the ground
 
03:44:59.030 --> 03:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
there I'd like to just share that you
 
03:45:01.250 --> 03:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
know the common understanding of yoga as
 
03:45:03.950 --> 03:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
a type of exercise that may involve
 
03:45:07.130 --> 03:45:07.140 align:start position:0%
specific poses or great flexibility
 
03:45:09.950 --> 03:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
um is is sort of is insufficient and
 
03:45:13.389 --> 03:45:13.399 align:start position:0%
incomplete in fact yoga is actually a
 
03:45:15.650 --> 03:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
philosophical or some considerative
 
03:45:17.210 --> 03:45:17.220 align:start position:0%
spiritual discipline for which the
 
03:45:19.190 --> 03:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
postures themselves are just a method of
 
03:45:21.950 --> 03:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
observing the teachings the advanced
 
03:45:23.809 --> 03:45:23.819 align:start position:0%
yoga programs are a vehicle for those
 
03:45:25.910 --> 03:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
who wish to learn more about those other
 
03:45:27.650 --> 03:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
components to do so so that's what I
 
03:45:29.030 --> 03:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
mean when I say deepening one's personal
 
03:45:31.429 --> 03:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
practice it's really sort of a study
 
03:45:31.439 --> 03:45:33.050 align:start position:0%
practice it's really sort of a study
session

03:45:33.050 --> 03:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:45:34.910 --> 03:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
um and then just to share that you know
 
03:45:37.490 --> 03:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
for those handful of folks who do go
 
03:45:38.929 --> 03:45:38.939 align:start position:0%
through the program to teach and who
 
03:45:41.090 --> 03:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
eventually go on to teach very few of
 
03:45:43.849 --> 03:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
them teach yoga as their primary career
 
03:45:46.429 --> 03:45:46.439 align:start position:0%
or singular source of income
 
03:45:49.429 --> 03:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
so just you know in to close I would say
 
03:45:51.290 --> 03:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
the licensure requirements for private
 
03:45:53.330 --> 03:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
post-secondary career schools are simply
 
03:45:55.010 --> 03:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
a bad fit for yoga programs for these
 
03:45:56.929 --> 03:45:56.939 align:start position:0%
programs in particular and are Geared
 
03:45:58.370 --> 03:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
for more Traditional School settings and
 
03:46:00.530 --> 03:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
educational programs the licensure
 
03:46:02.090 --> 03:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
application for example asks for
 
03:46:03.769 --> 03:46:03.779 align:start position:0%
admission requirements the school's
 
03:46:05.210 --> 03:46:05.220 align:start position:0%
policy on the transfer of credits an
 
03:46:07.070 --> 03:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
overview of curriculum offerings and a
 
03:46:08.269 --> 03:46:08.279 align:start position:0%
description of the school's grading
 
03:46:10.070 --> 03:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
system among many other requirements
 
03:46:11.990 --> 03:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
which simply aren't applicable to these
 
03:46:13.370 --> 03:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
kinds of programs
 
03:46:15.650 --> 03:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
exempting advanced yoga programs from
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
the state's private post-secondary
 
03:46:18.769 --> 03:46:18.779 align:start position:0%
Career School laws would align with how
 
03:46:20.450 --> 03:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
most other states treat these programs
 
03:46:23.330 --> 03:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
as well the majority do not license yoga
 
03:46:25.250 --> 03:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
teacher training programs quote unquote
 
03:46:27.650 --> 03:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
as career schools for these reasons we
 
03:46:29.870 --> 03:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
ask that you support Senate Bill 148 and
 
03:46:31.370 --> 03:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions the
 
03:46:32.929 --> 03:46:32.939 align:start position:0%
committee might have and I again would
 
03:46:34.190 --> 03:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
just really like to thank you for your
 
03:46:34.200 --> 03:46:35.210 align:start position:0%
just really like to thank you for your
time

03:46:35.210 --> 03:46:35.220 align:start position:0%

thank you very much Shannon are there
 
03:46:39.290 --> 03:46:39.300 align:start position:0%

03:46:42.349 --> 03:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
or Shannon just real quick Rick yes go
 
03:46:44.510 --> 03:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
ahead Dave thanks thanks very much Mr
 
03:46:46.490 --> 03:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks very much Ms Roche for
 
03:46:48.469 --> 03:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
joining us this afternoon
 
03:46:50.570 --> 03:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm interested where did you uh
 
03:46:52.010 --> 03:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
where did you hear or where did you
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
learn that the um primary role of the
 
03:46:56.450 --> 03:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is consumer
 
03:46:56.460 --> 03:46:57.950 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is consumer
protection

03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
protection
 
03:47:00.950 --> 03:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
just forgive me if I misspoke the I
 
03:47:02.330 --> 03:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
don't think that the primary role is
 
03:47:04.490 --> 03:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
consumer protection but my understanding
 
03:47:06.530 --> 03:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
from conversations we had with with
 
03:47:07.969 --> 03:47:07.979 align:start position:0%
relevant representatives in the
 
03:47:09.530 --> 03:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
department who would be overseeing the
 
03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
implementation of this provision is that
 
03:47:15.110 --> 03:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
one of their concerns that that sort of
 
03:47:16.130 --> 03:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
prompted this provision in the first
 
03:47:18.410 --> 03:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
place was one of consumer protection
 
03:47:21.170 --> 03:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
so I believe my comment was meant to be
 
03:47:23.630 --> 03:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
specific to that office okay no thank
 
03:47:27.349 --> 03:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
you I I certainly agree with your um
 
03:47:30.950 --> 03:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
your statements uh with respect to um
 
03:47:33.050 --> 03:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
um you know the intention of the primary
 
03:47:34.670 --> 03:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
and secondary Career Development being
 
03:47:38.090 --> 03:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
really you know beyond the scope of of
 
03:47:38.100 --> 03:47:39.590 align:start position:0%
really you know beyond the scope of of
of

03:47:39.590 --> 03:47:39.600 align:start position:0%

not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
03:47:52.070 --> 03:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:55.010 --> 03:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
now we can go back to Maureen
 
03:47:57.410 --> 03:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
hi thank you very much um I was actually
 
03:47:59.330 --> 03:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
the first yoga school first I'll
 
03:48:00.650 --> 03:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
introduce myself my name is Maureen
 
03:48:03.769 --> 03:48:03.779 align:start position:0%
Miller and I'm the owner of yoga NH it's
 
03:48:05.870 --> 03:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
a business that has led yoga classes and
 
03:48:07.490 --> 03:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
trainings and events throughout New
 
03:48:10.490 --> 03:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since 2004. though I currently
 
03:48:12.590 --> 03:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
live in Dover I lived in Concord for 25
 
03:48:14.630 --> 03:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
years and I had my business in the
 
03:48:16.670 --> 03:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
capital city for 14 of those years
 
03:48:19.130 --> 03:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
although I'm here to tell you about my
 
03:48:22.849 --> 03:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
story related to this particular Bill I
 
03:48:24.469 --> 03:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
know that I speak on behalf of many
 
03:48:26.870 --> 03:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
other yoga businesses so thank you so
 
03:48:28.969 --> 03:48:28.979 align:start position:0%
much for your time I was the first
 
03:48:32.030 --> 03:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
school that the first yoga business that
 
03:48:35.870 --> 03:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
the doe reached out to and it was very
 
03:48:38.030 --> 03:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
clear in those conversations that it was
 
03:48:40.849 --> 03:48:40.859 align:start position:0%
related to consumer protection around
 
03:48:40.859 --> 03:48:42.229 align:start position:0%
related to consumer protection around
Financial

03:48:42.229 --> 03:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
Financial
 
03:48:44.510 --> 03:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
concerns related to students if they had
 
03:48:48.170 --> 03:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
any issues and in my years of doing
 
03:48:49.729 --> 03:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
business there have never been any
 
03:48:51.889 --> 03:48:51.899 align:start position:0%
issues and when we were on our cynic
 
03:48:55.010 --> 03:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
call the Senate even stated that when
 
03:48:58.190 --> 03:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
they that in their mind they didn't know
 
03:49:00.410 --> 03:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
of any uh they act they actually asked
 
03:49:02.389 --> 03:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
the doe if there had been any issues
 
03:49:05.870 --> 03:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
related to student protection related to
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
financial concerns for yoga business and
 
03:49:11.570 --> 03:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
they said no as Shannon said right now
 
03:49:13.969 --> 03:49:13.979 align:start position:0%
some of the career schools
 
03:49:16.309 --> 03:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
you know yoga really just doesn't fit
 
03:49:18.769 --> 03:49:18.779 align:start position:0%
it's like CPAs I'm looking at my list of
 
03:49:20.570 --> 03:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
what I found on the department of Ed
 
03:49:22.849 --> 03:49:22.859 align:start position:0%
last night electrical technology
 
03:49:25.610 --> 03:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
computer technology lnas dental
 
03:49:28.130 --> 03:49:28.140 align:start position:0%
assistants these are truly careers where
 
03:49:30.229 --> 03:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
people take the program to become
 
03:49:33.530 --> 03:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
proficient in that profession and the
 
03:49:36.590 --> 03:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
yoga business that's not the norm in my
 
03:49:38.690 --> 03:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
16 years of leading yoga programming
 
03:49:41.750 --> 03:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
I've had hundreds of graduates and they
 
03:49:44.030 --> 03:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
have been primarily to deepen their yoga
 
03:49:46.370 --> 03:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
practice and in fact many of the people
 
03:49:49.790 --> 03:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
who have taken our trainings I know that
 
03:49:52.490 --> 03:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
um Katie will speak after me about some
 
03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
of the experience she had with leading
 
03:49:56.870 --> 03:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
some trainings they have included
 
03:49:59.750 --> 03:49:59.760 align:start position:0%

from my teacher training program they

have other careers that are their
 
03:50:10.490 --> 03:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
Mainstay to profession and they do this
 
03:50:12.469 --> 03:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
to deepen their practice to learn more
 
03:50:14.809 --> 03:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
about yoga to share with their family
 
03:50:17.290 --> 03:50:17.300 align:start position:0%

spirituality and that's really just you
 
03:50:22.429 --> 03:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
know in our mind a fancy word for
 
03:50:24.769 --> 03:50:24.779 align:start position:0%
learning about living life on and off
 
03:50:26.929 --> 03:50:26.939 align:start position:0%
the yoga mat and just really exploring
 
03:50:29.210 --> 03:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
more deeply so
 
03:50:31.790 --> 03:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
um let's see what else I wanted to say
 
03:50:35.090 --> 03:50:35.100 align:start position:0%
that a lot of times people who take the
 
03:50:38.090 --> 03:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
bus take of the program they have other
 
03:50:39.830 --> 03:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
businesses they have other jobs we
 
03:50:41.450 --> 03:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
already established that even though
 
03:50:43.910 --> 03:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
I've had my business for 16 years I
 
03:50:46.849 --> 03:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
worked for UNH for 15 of those years and
 
03:50:48.830 --> 03:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
currently I'm a finance director at a
 
03:50:50.269 --> 03:50:50.279 align:start position:0%
non-profit and the reason why I
 
03:50:52.729 --> 03:50:52.739 align:start position:0%
mentioned that is we are not doing this
 
03:50:56.090 --> 03:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
to make money in that particular career
 
03:50:57.950 --> 03:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
we have other careers and this sort of
 
03:50:59.750 --> 03:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
augment stuff for purposes that are
 
03:51:02.330 --> 03:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
important to us more related to a hobby
 
03:51:06.050 --> 03:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a career and
 
03:51:08.269 --> 03:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of the consumer protection
 
03:51:11.570 --> 03:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
programs and regulations in New
 
03:51:14.750 --> 03:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yoga businesses are required
 
03:51:14.760 --> 03:51:15.889 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yoga businesses are required
to

03:51:15.889 --> 03:51:15.899 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:51:18.889 --> 03:51:18.899 align:start position:0%
follow the law around any consumer
 
03:51:21.889 --> 03:51:21.899 align:start position:0%
protection laws that there are that are
 
03:51:24.710 --> 03:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
outside of the scope of this doe bill so
 
03:51:27.469 --> 03:51:27.479 align:start position:0%
we really support Senate Bill 148 and I
 
03:51:29.389 --> 03:51:29.399 align:start position:0%

03:52:06.170 --> 03:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
and our support of FB 148 part four so
 
03:52:09.170 --> 03:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
again thank you very much for hearing
 
03:52:11.690 --> 03:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
um what I have to share my name is Katie
 
03:52:13.910 --> 03:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
O'Connell and I own dragonfly yoga Barn
 
03:52:16.190 --> 03:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
which is way up here in North Sandwich
 
03:52:17.450 --> 03:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire actually really more
 
03:52:19.729 --> 03:52:19.739 align:start position:0%
central part of the state I've been
 
03:52:22.729 --> 03:52:22.739 align:start position:0%
practicing yoga for over 20 years and I
 
03:52:24.290 --> 03:52:24.300 align:start position:0%
have been teaching yoga in New Hampshire
 
03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
since 2003 my husband and I relocated a
 
03:52:31.309 --> 03:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
275 year old barn from moultonborough
 
03:52:33.290 --> 03:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
just down the road and put it up here in
 
03:52:34.550 --> 03:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
Sandwich so part of our business
 
03:52:36.110 --> 03:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
actually really is founded on
 
03:52:38.150 --> 03:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
maintaining the the natural landscape
 
03:52:39.650 --> 03:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
and incorporating that into our business
 
03:52:42.050 --> 03:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
which is I think really cool
 
03:52:43.610 --> 03:52:43.620 align:start position:0%
um that's also the same year that I
 
03:52:46.070 --> 03:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
finished teaching 15 years as a public
 
03:52:47.510 --> 03:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
school teacher in the state of New
 
03:52:49.370 --> 03:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so after rebuilding our
 
03:52:51.950 --> 03:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
antique barn I opened up my studio I
 
03:52:54.110 --> 03:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
left my Public School teaching job and
 
03:52:56.150 --> 03:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
I've been teaching here at dragonfly for
 
03:52:58.610 --> 03:52:58.620 align:start position:0%
the past 12 years in my small town
 
03:53:00.650 --> 03:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
locals and out-of-staters alike have
 
03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
often called dragonfly my business the
 
03:53:04.910 --> 03:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
heart of the community we offer a
 
03:53:08.410 --> 03:53:08.420 align:start position:0%
variety of programs to serve our local
 
03:53:12.050 --> 03:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
popular population it's always been a
 
03:53:13.309 --> 03:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
bit of a hustle and I think this is an
 
03:53:15.950 --> 03:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
important piece that I want to impart to
 
03:53:19.849 --> 03:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
create a program that are you know
 
03:53:21.769 --> 03:53:21.779 align:start position:0%
really meet a broad population here
 
03:53:23.510 --> 03:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
where I am in Sandwich I've always worn
 
03:53:25.550 --> 03:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
many hats to keep dragonfly yoga Barnes
 
03:53:27.710 --> 03:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
doors open and this has really never
 
03:53:29.630 --> 03:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
been truer than it is right now I have
 
03:53:31.729 --> 03:53:31.739 align:start position:0%
been closed for the past 16 months as a
 
03:53:33.229 --> 03:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
business and I've done all of my
 
03:53:35.030 --> 03:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
teaching online the same way that we are
 
03:53:38.090 --> 03:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
in this meeting right now on Zoom so
 
03:53:39.710 --> 03:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
um getting my doors back open is really
 
03:53:41.630 --> 03:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
important and yoga teacher training
 
03:53:44.750 --> 03:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
programs are a part of what I do
 
03:53:46.429 --> 03:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
um I am here to express my strong belief
 
03:53:48.769 --> 03:53:48.779 align:start position:0%
that imposing licensure on yoga teacher
 
03:53:50.210 --> 03:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
training programs in New Hampshire will
 
03:53:52.610 --> 03:53:52.620 align:start position:0%
negatively impact not only my studio as
 
03:53:54.410 --> 03:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
a small business in the state but other
 
03:53:56.809 --> 03:53:56.819 align:start position:0%
Studios like mine that offer
 
03:53:58.610 --> 03:53:58.620 align:start position:0%
life-changing studies in yoga and
 
03:54:01.550 --> 03:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
exactly as Maureen was suggesting
 
03:54:03.950 --> 03:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
the financial burden of licensure with
 
03:54:05.809 --> 03:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
its additional expenses not only puts
 
03:54:07.969 --> 03:54:07.979 align:start position:0%
the ability of Studio owners like me who
 
03:54:10.429 --> 03:54:10.439 align:start position:0%
offer training programs in Jeopardy but
 
03:54:12.530 --> 03:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
quite frankly the fees also have the
 
03:54:14.150 --> 03:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
capacity to close the doors of some
 
03:54:16.130 --> 03:54:16.140 align:start position:0%
small businesses like mine that do
 
03:54:18.170 --> 03:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
piecemeal together a lot of different
 
03:54:20.150 --> 03:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
threads to make up what one might
 
03:54:22.550 --> 03:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
actually call a reasonable living we
 
03:54:23.450 --> 03:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
don't really
 
03:54:24.889 --> 03:54:24.899 align:start position:0%
you know in the yoga world we don't
 
03:54:27.110 --> 03:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
really call our earnings a salary
 
03:54:29.630 --> 03:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
there's really no such thing
 
03:54:31.370 --> 03:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
um this is problematic for small
 
03:54:33.349 --> 03:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
businesses like mine who run only one
 
03:54:35.269 --> 03:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
training per year and rely on multiple
 
03:54:37.429 --> 03:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
streams of income to remain open and
 
03:54:39.650 --> 03:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
that's my situation personally you've
 
03:54:41.269 --> 03:54:41.279 align:start position:0%
already heard from Maureen and Shannon
 
03:54:44.389 --> 03:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
about their broad experiences Maureen in
 
03:54:45.650 --> 03:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
particular as a teacher and a business
 
03:54:47.750 --> 03:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
owner in New Hampshire and I would
 
03:54:49.610 --> 03:54:49.620 align:start position:0%
second every note that they both shared
 
03:54:51.290 --> 03:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
and punctuate Maureen's point that most
 
03:54:53.870 --> 03:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
of our yoga students come to us after
 
03:54:55.910 --> 03:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
years of personal practice and most
 
03:54:58.370 --> 03:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
often to deepen their own practice of
 
03:55:00.290 --> 03:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
self which really is that body mind
 
03:55:03.229 --> 03:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
spirit and they elect to engage in a
 
03:55:05.530 --> 03:55:05.540 align:start position:0%
personal development training like ours
 
03:55:07.550 --> 03:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
to that end
 
03:55:09.950 --> 03:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
I also want to note that I have been an
 
03:55:11.929 --> 03:55:11.939 align:start position:0%
adjunct faculty member at Plymouth State
 
03:55:13.370 --> 03:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
University and a high school English
 
03:55:14.570 --> 03:55:14.580 align:start position:0%
teacher in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:55:18.830 --> 03:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
for 15 years I I completed my my work in
 
03:55:21.590 --> 03:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
the public sector of Education
 
03:55:23.570 --> 03:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
um gosh 12 years ago now since I opened
 
03:55:25.070 --> 03:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
my business here so I can personally
 
03:55:26.269 --> 03:55:26.279 align:start position:0%
attest to the difference between
 
03:55:29.210 --> 03:55:29.220 align:start position:0%
training students for a career and what
 
03:55:30.889 --> 03:55:30.899 align:start position:0%
it means to share and teach programs
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
that are intended for personal growth
 
03:55:34.510 --> 03:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
and development like what I'm doing now
 
03:55:37.370 --> 03:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
and a yoga teacher training is certainly
 
03:55:39.950 --> 03:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
the latter a rare few will ever call
 
03:55:41.929 --> 03:55:41.939 align:start position:0%
yoga a career I don't think I've ever
 
03:55:43.870 --> 03:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
heard any of my colleagues use that word
 
03:55:46.070 --> 03:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
most yoga teachers do not receive
 
03:55:47.689 --> 03:55:47.699 align:start position:0%
salaries they would not call yoga
 
03:55:50.809 --> 03:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
training a standalone income yoga
 
03:55:53.450 --> 03:55:53.460 align:start position:0%
teaching a standalone income I think
 
03:55:54.950 --> 03:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
most of us do it because we love it and
 
03:55:56.689 --> 03:55:56.699 align:start position:0%
because we know how beneficial it is for
 
03:55:59.389 --> 03:55:59.399 align:start position:0%
people in our community to practice yoga
 
03:56:01.849 --> 03:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
and finally those who go on to share
 
03:56:04.250 --> 03:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
yoga with others rarely leave another
 
03:56:06.530 --> 03:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
job solely to teach yoga as Maureen
 
03:56:08.570 --> 03:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
suggested it's just simply not feasible
 
03:56:11.809 --> 03:56:11.819 align:start position:0%
for most of us to do that additionally
 
03:56:14.150 --> 03:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
many students who study with us do go
 
03:56:16.189 --> 03:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
back to their communities to offer yoga
 
03:56:19.370 --> 03:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
and meditation and and other rounds of
 
03:56:22.309 --> 03:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
yoga by donation oftentimes and often to
 
03:56:24.229 --> 03:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
underserved populations at-risk
 
03:56:26.570 --> 03:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
communities and even to colleagues at
 
03:56:28.790 --> 03:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
their real job you know where corporate
 
03:56:30.950 --> 03:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
folks might be actually making a salary
 
03:56:33.229 --> 03:56:33.239 align:start position:0%
yoga is starting to you know move into
 
03:56:35.150 --> 03:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
these Realms and with really good reason
 
03:56:37.550 --> 03:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
and great effect
 
03:56:39.349 --> 03:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
um this is where we can alleviate stress
 
03:56:40.969 --> 03:56:40.979 align:start position:0%
tension help knit people into
 
03:56:42.710 --> 03:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
fellowships that promote overall
 
03:56:42.720 --> 03:56:43.729 align:start position:0%
fellowships that promote overall
Wellness

03:56:43.729 --> 03:56:43.739 align:start position:0%
Wellness
 
03:56:45.469 --> 03:56:45.479 align:start position:0%
and I would also say that our teachers
 
03:56:46.550 --> 03:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
have brought to their respective
 
03:56:48.410 --> 03:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
communities practices that can really
 
03:56:51.349 --> 03:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
only be seen as enrichment and that
 
03:56:53.510 --> 03:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
serve the human Spirit as well as really
 
03:56:55.070 --> 03:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
important right now boost our immune
 
03:56:55.080 --> 03:56:55.790 align:start position:0%
important right now boost our immune
system

03:56:55.790 --> 03:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:56:57.590 --> 03:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
after the stress of the past year I
 
03:56:59.269 --> 03:56:59.279 align:start position:0%
would argue that really what we all need
 
03:57:02.210 --> 03:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
is more yoga and taking yoga schools out
 
03:57:04.630 --> 03:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
of this designation as a career program
 
03:57:07.490 --> 03:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
will certainly help that endeavor in my
 
03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
opinion and I believe the opinion of my
 
03:57:11.630 --> 03:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
colleagues here so again with so much
 
03:57:12.830 --> 03:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
gratitude just thank you for the
 
03:57:15.530 --> 03:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share today
 
03:57:17.809 --> 03:57:17.819 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Katie yeah we can

um
 
03:57:32.809 --> 03:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
do you know if there are any uh schools
 
03:57:34.729 --> 03:57:34.739 align:start position:0%
entities whatever that have a gross
 
03:57:37.309 --> 03:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
annual income of over a hundred thousand
 
03:57:40.309 --> 03:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
in the state that's directly a treatable
 
03:57:41.929 --> 03:57:41.939 align:start position:0%
to instruction
 
03:57:44.450 --> 03:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
Etc you know is there anybody who
 
03:57:47.330 --> 03:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
actually would need to have a surety
 
03:57:49.550 --> 03:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
bond in the state of New Hampshire as
 
03:57:51.590 --> 03:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
you know representative I'm not sure if

I am unaware of of other the specific
 
03:58:01.849 --> 03:58:01.859 align:start position:0%
financials of other schools
 
03:58:03.710 --> 03:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
um I just know that most of the schools
 
03:58:05.870 --> 03:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
and the the colleagues of mine that I am
 
03:58:08.809 --> 03:58:08.819 align:start position:0%
aware of and work with most of them do
 
03:58:11.030 --> 03:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
not have those kinds of figures in their
 
03:58:13.010 --> 03:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
yoga teacher training programs no
 
03:58:15.950 --> 03:58:15.960 align:start position:0%

um
 
03:59:50.389 --> 03:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
the direct answer to the question
 
03:59:52.849 --> 03:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
representative regarding did you mean
 
03:59:54.769 --> 03:59:54.779 align:start position:0%
yoga schools over a hundred thousand
 
03:59:56.990 --> 03:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
dollars in annual gross tuition or
 
03:59:59.269 --> 03:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
schools in general this is my question
 
03:59:59.279 --> 04:00:00.889 align:start position:0%
schools in general this is my question
back

04:00:00.889 --> 04:00:00.899 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:00:04.189 --> 04:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
um the in the thing it specifies
 
04:00:06.650 --> 04:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
uh gross annual income over a hundred
 
04:00:09.769 --> 04:00:09.779 align:start position:0%
thousand etc etc
 
04:00:11.929 --> 04:00:11.939 align:start position:0%
um would provide need to provide a
 
04:00:13.849 --> 04:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
surety bond and I'm just wondering if we
 
04:00:16.010 --> 04:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
have anybody that actually fits into
 
04:00:18.889 --> 04:00:18.899 align:start position:0%
that we would actually need to provide
 
04:00:22.189 --> 04:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:25.670 --> 04:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
yep okay so um I can tell you that
 
04:00:28.429 --> 04:00:28.439 align:start position:0%
Statewide we currently license about 65
 
04:00:32.450 --> 04:00:32.460 align:start position:0%
schools and of that 65 about a dozen are
 
04:00:34.490 --> 04:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
under 100 000 in annual gross tuition
 
04:00:38.229 --> 04:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
and these schools span everything from
 
04:00:41.769 --> 04:00:41.779 align:start position:0%
electrician computer dog training
 
04:00:44.269 --> 04:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
various types of vocations
 
04:00:46.969 --> 04:00:46.979 align:start position:0%
as far as specifically yoga schools I
 
04:00:49.370 --> 04:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
don't know of any at this moment however
 
04:00:51.229 --> 04:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
we only license a small handful
 
04:00:53.570 --> 04:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
currently and they're all relatively
 
04:00:55.070 --> 04:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
small schools that are under a hundred
 
04:00:55.080 --> 04:00:59.290 align:start position:0%
small schools that are under a hundred
thousand

04:00:59.290 --> 04:00:59.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:03.110 --> 04:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
so my follow-up is is there any reason
 
04:01:05.870 --> 04:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
why we need to have that section in
 
04:01:05.880 --> 04:01:07.550 align:start position:0%
why we need to have that section in
there

04:01:07.550 --> 04:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:01:11.389 --> 04:01:11.399 align:start position:0%
um if it's fine for smaller schools to
 
04:01:13.729 --> 04:01:13.739 align:start position:0%
not put up a surety why do larger
 
04:01:18.290 --> 04:01:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:19.570 --> 04:01:19.580 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:01:23.630 --> 04:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
the uh the
 
04:01:26.570 --> 04:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
let me back up so section M makes
 
04:01:28.790 --> 04:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
perfect sense to exempt
 
04:01:31.550 --> 04:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
the schools with annual gross tuition of
 
04:01:33.410 --> 04:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
under a hundred thousand that would
 
04:01:35.210 --> 04:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
remove the burden from our smallest
 
04:01:37.670 --> 04:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
schools which are as one of the um
 
04:01:39.290 --> 04:01:39.300 align:start position:0%
Witnesses mentioned these are all small
 
04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
businesses and this would eliminate the
 
04:01:44.330 --> 04:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
450 annual fee that they paid currently
 
04:01:46.849 --> 04:01:46.859 align:start position:0%
as well as their need to have a surety
 
04:01:48.950 --> 04:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
bond which at that level probably cost
 
04:01:50.570 --> 04:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
them several hundred dollars a year as
 
04:01:52.610 --> 04:01:52.620 align:start position:0%
well to maintain
 
04:01:55.849 --> 04:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
um and the next section
 
04:01:58.490 --> 04:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
is is somewhat redundant and we're
 
04:01:59.809 --> 04:01:59.819 align:start position:0%
actually a little concerned with the
 
04:02:02.269 --> 04:02:02.279 align:start position:0%
Department that the way it is worded
 
04:02:04.790 --> 04:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
might require us to actually
 
04:02:08.809 --> 04:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
license more schools not less schools
 
04:02:11.150 --> 04:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
and let me tell you what I mean by that
 
04:02:13.849 --> 04:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
the word in currently used in the
 
04:02:13.859 --> 04:02:15.110 align:start position:0%
the word in currently used in the
statute

04:02:15.110 --> 04:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:02:17.830 --> 04:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
speaks of vocational education
 
04:02:20.269 --> 04:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
this wording entities offering
 
04:02:22.189 --> 04:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
instructional programming courses for
 
04:02:23.750 --> 04:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
teaching Fitness and recreational
 
04:02:23.760 --> 04:02:25.250 align:start position:0%
teaching Fitness and recreational
Wellness

04:02:25.250 --> 04:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
Wellness
 
04:02:27.050 --> 04:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
it doesn't speak at all there about
 
04:02:29.870 --> 04:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
vocational training it so what we're
 
04:02:33.410 --> 04:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
worried about is that fitness clubs that
 
04:02:34.790 --> 04:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
teach classes
 
04:02:36.410 --> 04:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
to people
 
04:02:38.990 --> 04:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
um under the guise of potentially them
 
04:02:41.870 --> 04:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
you know conducting various types of
 
04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
classes again not a vocation but
 
04:02:47.030 --> 04:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
um this exists currently in the state so
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
we're a little concerned that this
 
04:02:53.150 --> 04:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
wording actually expands the scope not
 
04:02:54.769 --> 04:02:54.779 align:start position:0%
um limits the scope
 
04:02:56.570 --> 04:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
and I think that would be contrary to
 
04:02:59.090 --> 04:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
the goal of this legislation
 
04:03:01.729 --> 04:03:01.739 align:start position:0%
so do you see a problem with taking n
 
04:03:03.710 --> 04:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
out completely
 
04:03:07.010 --> 04:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
we do not and that would be
 
04:03:09.229 --> 04:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
that would be my recommendation
 
04:03:10.849 --> 04:03:10.859 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:03:13.010 --> 04:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
of course that's what's up to the
 
04:03:15.189 --> 04:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
legislature but it seemed to be
 
04:03:20.330 --> 04:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
expanding the net knot not reeling it in
 
04:03:22.750 --> 04:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:03:26.510 --> 04:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh Steve can you please explain to me uh
 
04:03:28.610 --> 04:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
or give me some examples of what these
 
04:03:32.210 --> 04:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
vocational schools would be that uh you
 
04:03:35.030 --> 04:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
alluded to some others there just
 
04:03:37.309 --> 04:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
briefly can you go through some of the
 
04:03:39.110 --> 04:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know the areas which we're talking
 
04:03:39.120 --> 04:03:41.030 align:start position:0%
you know the areas which we're talking
about

04:03:41.030 --> 04:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:03:42.590 --> 04:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
yes sure thank you for the question
 
04:03:45.290 --> 04:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
representative live uh as I said we
 
04:03:48.290 --> 04:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
license about 65 schools in areas as
 
04:03:51.590 --> 04:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
diverse as pet grooming we have several
 
04:03:53.269 --> 04:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
schools that teach people how to be
 
04:03:55.729 --> 04:03:55.739 align:start position:0%
professional pet groomers
 
04:03:58.189 --> 04:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
we also have a number of schools that
 
04:03:58.199 --> 04:03:58.990 align:start position:0%
we also have a number of schools that
teach

04:03:58.990 --> 04:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
teach
 
04:04:02.030 --> 04:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
individuals various computer occupations
 
04:04:04.429 --> 04:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
so computer programming systems
 
04:04:08.330 --> 04:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
engineering we have schools that have
 
04:04:11.570 --> 04:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
electrician components we have schools
 
04:04:12.860 --> 04:04:12.870 align:start position:0%
that have
 
04:04:12.870 --> 04:04:14.590 align:start position:0%
that have
[Music]

04:04:14.590 --> 04:04:14.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:04:19.010 --> 04:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh uh massage training again instructing
 
04:04:20.210 --> 04:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
individuals how to become massage
 
04:04:20.220 --> 04:04:21.410 align:start position:0%
individuals how to become massage
teachers

04:04:21.410 --> 04:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
04:04:24.590 --> 04:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
so really it's a variety we have several
 
04:04:27.290 --> 04:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
bartending schools that teach people how
 
04:04:29.750 --> 04:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
to be professional bartenders
 
04:04:29.760 --> 04:04:31.010 align:start position:0%
to be professional bartenders
so

04:04:31.010 --> 04:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:04:32.570 --> 04:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
it really covers a lot of ground and I
 
04:04:34.250 --> 04:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
would also just like to add in if I
 
04:04:36.650 --> 04:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
could represent Atlantic we do
 
04:04:38.269 --> 04:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
occasionally have a precipitous School
 
04:04:40.969 --> 04:04:40.979 align:start position:0%
closure and we recently back in December
 
04:04:44.030 --> 04:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
had a school close in Manchester New
 
04:04:45.590 --> 04:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a nursing school
 
04:04:49.189 --> 04:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
and their sudden closure because of the
 
04:04:51.670 --> 04:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
surety bond that we require
 
04:04:54.889 --> 04:04:54.899 align:start position:0%
approximately 690 000 in tuition is
 
04:04:56.750 --> 04:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
being refunded to students who couldn't
 
04:04:59.990 --> 04:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:01.670 --> 04:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
so although it doesn't come up that
 
04:05:06.710 --> 04:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:09.290 --> 04:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
that's that's the information that's
 
04:05:11.870 --> 04:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
worth our attention that you know when
 
04:05:14.090 --> 04:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
somebody closes then
 
04:05:16.969 --> 04:05:16.979 align:start position:0%
to have the the bond to support somebody
 
04:05:19.250 --> 04:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
that's already paid that tuition sort of
 
04:05:23.630 --> 04:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:26.389 --> 04:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
so are there further questions for Steve
 
04:05:30.349 --> 04:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
yes uh represent like this yes so
 
04:05:33.889 --> 04:05:33.899 align:start position:0%
um following on that discussion then
 
04:05:33.899 --> 04:05:37.030 align:start position:0%
um following on that discussion then
foreign

04:05:37.030 --> 04:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
would that surety bond still be required
 
04:05:43.130 --> 04:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
for all of those other things and we're
 
04:05:46.729 --> 04:05:46.739 align:start position:0%
just taking out the part for the yoga
 
04:05:46.739 --> 04:05:49.189 align:start position:0%
just taking out the part for the yoga
instructors

04:05:49.189 --> 04:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
instructors
 
04:05:49.199 --> 04:05:50.809 align:start position:0%
instructors
yes

04:05:50.809 --> 04:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:05:53.090 --> 04:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
um what this would do is it would merely
 
04:05:55.790 --> 04:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
eliminate the requirement for schools
 
04:05:57.530 --> 04:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
that have less than a hundred thousand
 
04:05:58.670 --> 04:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
in annual gross tuition it would remove
 
04:06:02.929 --> 04:06:02.939 align:start position:0%
the requirement for them to be licensed
 
04:06:04.910 --> 04:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
and the associated requirement of surety
 
04:06:07.790 --> 04:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
bond but everybody who has higher
 
04:06:09.170 --> 04:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
Revenue than a hundred thousand per year
 
04:06:11.150 --> 04:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
would in fact still need to get a surety
 
04:06:12.590 --> 04:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
bond and get licensed
 
04:06:16.250 --> 04:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:18.590 --> 04:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
any further questions of the Department
 
04:06:20.570 --> 04:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
of Education
 
04:06:25.189 --> 04:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:27.950 --> 04:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and and thank you
 
04:06:30.290 --> 04:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
Mr Apple FB
 
04:06:33.349 --> 04:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
um so a lot of yoga centers are called
 
04:06:36.490 --> 04:06:36.500 align:start position:0%
ashrams and they are actually
 
04:06:40.849 --> 04:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
religious as well as as training schools
 
04:06:40.859 --> 04:06:41.689 align:start position:0%
religious as well as as training schools
um

04:06:41.689 --> 04:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:44.689 --> 04:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
how do we differentiate between
 
04:06:47.590 --> 04:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
schools that teach yoga
 
04:06:49.809 --> 04:06:49.819 align:start position:0%
like an ashram
 
04:06:54.889 --> 04:06:54.899 align:start position:0%
or even a yoga instructor and
 
04:06:58.250 --> 04:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
other religious schools that in fact
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
have education that may be like a
 
04:07:04.990 --> 04:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
carpenter uh carpentry
 
04:07:07.969 --> 04:07:07.979 align:start position:0%
education not as part of their religious
 
04:07:07.979 --> 04:07:09.650 align:start position:0%
education not as part of their religious
Mission

04:07:09.650 --> 04:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
Mission
 
04:07:11.990 --> 04:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
um I think we're getting into a really
 
04:07:14.689 --> 04:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
slippery slope with with all this trying
 
04:07:18.410 --> 04:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
to certify all these small uh different
 
04:07:20.590 --> 04:07:20.600 align:start position:0%
types of of schools
 
04:07:24.830 --> 04:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
or I would put quote schools on it uh
 
04:07:27.050 --> 04:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
for people that are trying to get into
 
04:07:27.060 --> 04:07:28.550 align:start position:0%
for people that are trying to get into
these

04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:07:28.560 --> 04:07:29.929 align:start position:0%
these
either

04:07:29.929 --> 04:07:29.939 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:07:34.189 --> 04:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
secondary jobs or their their Hobbies uh
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
you know and and we're not so worried
 
04:07:38.650 --> 04:07:38.660 align:start position:0%
about private colleges
 
04:07:42.349 --> 04:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
that maybe don't have a surety bond with
 
04:07:44.210 --> 04:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
them so how do you make the
 
04:07:46.910 --> 04:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
differentiation between
 
04:07:50.269 --> 04:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
religious education and
 
04:07:53.150 --> 04:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
um ashrams or places where they actually
 
04:07:56.150 --> 04:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
train for yoga
 
04:07:57.050 --> 04:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:07:58.729 --> 04:07:58.739 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner that it is a
 
04:08:01.130 --> 04:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
slippery slope I would concur
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
um we look to the current statutes as
 
04:08:06.410 --> 04:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
our guide right now and the distinction
 
04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
that we make is
 
04:08:12.590 --> 04:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
is this program vocational in nature so
 
04:08:15.170 --> 04:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
in the example of a yoga School am I
 
04:08:17.630 --> 04:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
teaching my students yoga
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
and whatever goes along with that
 
04:08:22.189 --> 04:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
curriculum or am I teaching my students
 
04:08:25.670 --> 04:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
how to be yoga teachers
 
04:08:28.250 --> 04:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
that is the difference just practicing
 
04:08:30.530 --> 04:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
yoga is avocation
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
learning how to teach other people yoga
 
04:08:34.910 --> 04:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
that I could then earn a living from
 
04:08:37.729 --> 04:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
that's vocational and that's what we
 
04:08:41.210 --> 04:08:41.220 align:start position:0%
have articulated in the in the statute
 
04:08:43.490 --> 04:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
and that's how we look at this so it
 
04:08:44.990 --> 04:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't make the statute does not
 
04:08:46.670 --> 04:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
delineate between for-profit or
 
04:08:49.010 --> 04:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
non-profit does not delineate between
 
04:08:52.689 --> 04:08:52.699 align:start position:0%
secular or religious if a religious
 
04:08:56.450 --> 04:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
organization were to decide to um start
 
04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
training massage therapists
 
04:09:01.790 --> 04:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
how to become massage therapists
 
04:09:03.229 --> 04:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
they would
 
04:09:05.210 --> 04:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
see they would need to be licensed if
 
04:09:08.110 --> 04:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
you know if the hundred thousand
 
04:09:11.330 --> 04:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
Amendment here goes in if they did you
 
04:09:12.530 --> 04:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
know had more than a hundred thousand
 
04:09:13.910 --> 04:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
dollars a year in Revenue they would
 
04:09:14.990 --> 04:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
need to get licensed whether they're
 
04:09:17.210 --> 04:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
religious entity or not because they're
 
04:09:20.830 --> 04:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:23.330 --> 04:09:23.340 align:start position:0%
can I have a follow-up yes you may
 
04:09:25.330 --> 04:09:25.340 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner so what about
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
internships or people who learn to
 
04:09:32.269 --> 04:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
Barber now that we've passed that law uh
 
04:09:35.030 --> 04:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
or trying to suppose they are doing
 
04:09:37.790 --> 04:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
internships with their parents and maybe
 
04:09:40.790 --> 04:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
some of the kids come in uh and they're
 
04:09:42.889 --> 04:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
teaching them a vocation I mean
 
04:09:46.189 --> 04:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
Boy Scouts teach vocation to some level
 
04:09:47.570 --> 04:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:09:50.269 --> 04:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
um I just I I think
 
04:09:52.250 --> 04:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
I just have a hard time
 
04:09:55.610 --> 04:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
with this whole uh sort of you know
 
04:09:59.450 --> 04:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
licensing issue uh of these smaller
 
04:10:02.210 --> 04:10:02.220 align:start position:0%
groups uh you know the the people are
 
04:10:07.070 --> 04:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:08.929 --> 04:10:08.939 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um there wasn't
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
a question in that so it was more of a
 
04:10:13.610 --> 04:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
comment sorry yeah I was just if I could
 
04:10:15.889 --> 04:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
just um I would note that
 
04:10:19.250 --> 04:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
um I it's our position this legislation
 
04:10:21.650 --> 04:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
actually will help those smallest of
 
04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
businesses by setting the bar to 100 000
 
04:10:26.929 --> 04:10:26.939 align:start position:0%
a year currently they all have to get a
 
04:10:29.269 --> 04:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
license now
 
04:10:31.849 --> 04:10:31.859 align:start position:0%
the entities that have annual gross
 
04:10:33.410 --> 04:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
tuition of under 100
 
04:10:36.889 --> 04:10:36.899 align:start position:0%
000 will be Exempted from licensure so
 
04:10:38.630 --> 04:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
um to your to your point I don't have an
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
answer either to your comment but
 
04:10:42.710 --> 04:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
um that's
 
04:10:45.590 --> 04:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's the conversation it's been a
 
04:10:51.410 --> 04:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:53.929 --> 04:10:53.939 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Tanner and uh
 
04:10:57.349 --> 04:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
Mr Appleby I can remember we had this
 
04:11:01.130 --> 04:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
discussion uh in this committee at least
 
04:11:05.929 --> 04:11:05.939 align:start position:0%
12 years ago with Dr Ed McKay when we
 
04:11:07.729 --> 04:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
were talking about post-secondary career
 
04:11:09.590 --> 04:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
schools and and
 
04:11:12.590 --> 04:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
um those uh institutions that were
 
04:11:14.710 --> 04:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
putting the sign out front saying school
 
04:11:18.590 --> 04:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
and then the the customer or the
 
04:11:20.269 --> 04:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
individual walking down the street says
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
well here's a license or approved School
 
04:11:27.050 --> 04:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
um how do we guarantee now that
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
somebody's not going to put the signed
 
04:11:31.309 --> 04:11:31.319 align:start position:0%
School up in front and and have an
 
04:11:32.809 --> 04:11:32.819 align:start position:0%
income of less a hundred thousand
 
04:11:34.490 --> 04:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
dollars but you know
 
04:11:34.500 --> 04:11:35.290 align:start position:0%
dollars but you know
um

04:11:35.290 --> 04:11:35.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:37.490 --> 04:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
if the person on the street is not going
 
04:11:39.229 --> 04:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
to know whether that's a licensed school
 
04:11:42.050 --> 04:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
or not is there is this
 
04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
um do they get licensure without having
 
04:11:47.510 --> 04:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
to pay this 450 bucks or or how's that
 
04:11:47.520 --> 04:11:48.590 align:start position:0%
to pay this 450 bucks or or how's that
work

04:11:48.590 --> 04:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:11:50.750 --> 04:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
or is it needed
 
04:11:52.610 --> 04:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so
 
04:11:55.090 --> 04:11:55.100 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:11:57.889 --> 04:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
if the current statute not
 
04:11:59.689 --> 04:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding this amendment to the
 
04:12:01.849 --> 04:12:01.859 align:start position:0%
statute the current statute is
 
04:12:04.490 --> 04:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
anyone that's that's conducting classes
 
04:12:05.929 --> 04:12:05.939 align:start position:0%
that are vocational in nature they call
 
04:12:09.110 --> 04:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
themselves a school an Institute uh
 
04:12:10.910 --> 04:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
those individuals would need to seek
 
04:12:10.920 --> 04:12:12.590 align:start position:0%
those individuals would need to seek
licensure

04:12:12.590 --> 04:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
04:12:15.229 --> 04:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
from the department and one of the
 
04:12:16.429 --> 04:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
requirements is that they publicly
 
04:12:18.110 --> 04:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
display that license typically in their
 
04:12:19.550 --> 04:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
Lobby or waiting area
 
04:12:22.070 --> 04:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
so that that license is displayed
 
04:12:22.080 --> 04:12:23.229 align:start position:0%
so that that license is displayed
publicly

04:12:23.229 --> 04:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
publicly
 
04:12:26.330 --> 04:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
and we also ask that to be in their
 
04:12:26.340 --> 04:12:27.349 align:start position:0%
and we also ask that to be in their
catalog

04:12:27.349 --> 04:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
catalog
 
04:12:29.150 --> 04:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
their catalog can be online it can be
 
04:12:29.160 --> 04:12:30.769 align:start position:0%
their catalog can be online it can be
printed

04:12:30.769 --> 04:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
printed
 
04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
but we ask that they also put down that
 
04:12:34.010 --> 04:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
they are licensed by the Department of
 
04:12:36.110 --> 04:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
Education and if there are student
 
04:12:37.610 --> 04:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
complaints they direct them to the
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:42.590 --> 04:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
so I'll follow up so if they have a
 
04:12:45.349 --> 04:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
gross income a gross tuition income of
 
04:12:47.510 --> 04:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
less than a hundred thousand dollars can
 
04:12:52.130 --> 04:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:53.990 --> 04:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
um per this if this legislation were to
 
04:12:57.590 --> 04:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:57.600 --> 04:12:58.570 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:12:58.570 --> 04:12:58.580 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:13:01.010 --> 04:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:13:04.729 --> 04:13:04.739 align:start position:0%
further questions of the department
 
04:13:06.889 --> 04:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands
 
04:13:08.809 --> 04:13:08.819 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Appleby do we
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
have any other folks on part four
 
04:13:14.150 --> 04:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh actually we have
 
04:13:17.590 --> 04:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
Four Hands raised
 
04:13:19.610 --> 04:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
people who have
 
04:13:22.450 --> 04:13:22.460 align:start position:0%
previously spoken
 
04:13:25.429 --> 04:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
yeah we will not be taking people at
 
04:13:27.710 --> 04:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
previous is not a discussion that's a
 
04:13:29.809 --> 04:13:29.819 align:start position:0%
testimony so we won't take anybody to
 
04:13:32.630 --> 04:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's testified before unless it's a
 
04:13:35.929 --> 04:13:35.939 align:start position:0%
a senator trying to qualify something so
 
04:13:38.870 --> 04:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh Maureen Marston I believe we have not
 
04:13:45.769 --> 04:13:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:45.779 --> 04:13:46.790 align:start position:0%
 
her

04:13:46.790 --> 04:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
her
 
04:13:52.790 --> 04:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:54.410 --> 04:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
okay there we go
 
04:13:56.269 --> 04:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
um representative Vlad and members of
 
04:13:58.130 --> 04:13:58.140 align:start position:0%
the uh House Education committee I'm
 
04:14:00.650 --> 04:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
very obviously not Senator Ward and very
 
04:14:02.689 --> 04:14:02.699 align:start position:0%
obviously not Marie Marston I'm Griffin
 
04:14:02.699 --> 04:14:04.250 align:start position:0%
obviously not Marie Marston I'm Griffin
Roberge

04:14:04.250 --> 04:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
Roberge
 
04:14:10.630 --> 04:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:13.130 --> 04:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
very sorry members of the committee um
 
04:14:15.170 --> 04:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
Senator Ward is currently in caucus and
 
04:14:18.170 --> 04:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh her his her assistant is helping
 
04:14:19.610 --> 04:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
other people at the moment
 
04:14:21.349 --> 04:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
um Senator Ward asks that I read into
 
04:14:23.870 --> 04:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
the record uh her written testimony for
 
04:14:27.290 --> 04:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
part four of Samuel 148 uh would that be
 
04:14:28.490 --> 04:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
okay with the members of the committee
 
04:14:31.370 --> 04:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
that would be fine
 
04:14:33.889 --> 04:14:33.899 align:start position:0%
part four of Senate Bill 148 deals with
 
04:14:35.510 --> 04:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
a problem that came to our attention
 
04:14:37.969 --> 04:14:37.979 align:start position:0%
because of the very limited uh I'm sorry
 
04:14:40.250 --> 04:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
very broad wording of what a
 
04:14:42.710 --> 04:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
post-secondary career school is under
 
04:14:45.769 --> 04:14:45.779 align:start position:0%
our law which is capturing programs not
 
04:14:48.170 --> 04:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
intended to require the strict licensing
 
04:14:52.510 --> 04:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
and other requirements listed in RSA
 
04:14:55.490 --> 04:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
188-g it came to our attention that
 
04:14:57.590 --> 04:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
programs like yoga instruction were
 
04:14:59.210 --> 04:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
recently deemed by the Department of
 
04:15:00.729 --> 04:15:00.739 align:start position:0%
Education to require
 
04:15:03.950 --> 04:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education licensure which
 
04:15:07.030 --> 04:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
is placing a costly uh burden
 
04:15:09.229 --> 04:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
administrative compliance and oversight
 
04:15:11.689 --> 04:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
that doesn't fit within that profession
 
04:15:15.889 --> 04:15:15.899 align:start position:0%
RSA 188g lists uh Department of
 
04:15:18.170 --> 04:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
Education oversight to include the
 
04:15:20.809 --> 04:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
premise I'm sorry the premises the
 
04:15:23.210 --> 04:15:23.220 align:start position:0%
curriculum teaching materials faculty
 
04:15:25.670 --> 04:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
performance sales literature financial
 
04:15:27.650 --> 04:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
data and other matters which are
 
04:15:27.660 --> 04:15:29.030 align:start position:0%
data and other matters which are
relevant

04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
04:15:31.250 --> 04:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
the law is structured to cover more
 
04:15:33.889 --> 04:15:33.899 align:start position:0%
formal educational institutions like
 
04:15:36.290 --> 04:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
nursing and truck driving schools that
 
04:15:38.750 --> 04:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
actually have curriculum and credits and
 
04:15:41.450 --> 04:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
a degree the recent interpretation is
 
04:15:43.969 --> 04:15:43.979 align:start position:0%
placing requirements that make most
 
04:15:47.030 --> 04:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
small yoga programs prohibitive from
 
04:15:48.830 --> 04:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
even being in business
 
04:15:50.809 --> 04:15:50.819 align:start position:0%
with the help of the yoga industry and
 
04:15:53.929 --> 04:15:53.939 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education part four is
 
04:15:57.469 --> 04:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
good pro-small business legislation that
 
04:15:59.630 --> 04:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
removes an obstacle that is harming New
 
04:16:02.269 --> 04:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses it has two pieces
 
04:16:05.750 --> 04:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
first it carves out of the law all very
 
04:16:08.330 --> 04:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
small businesses that take in under a
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars of income
 
04:16:13.910 --> 04:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
secondly for wellness programs like yoga
 
04:16:15.830 --> 04:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
if they earn more than a hundred
 
04:16:18.290 --> 04:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars from teaching they must
 
04:16:20.870 --> 04:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
still obtain the bond requirement that
 
04:16:23.330 --> 04:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
is in the current law to give consumers
 
04:16:25.130 --> 04:16:25.140 align:start position:0%
protection in the event of business
 
04:16:28.550 --> 04:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
ceases operating and collected income in
 
04:16:30.950 --> 04:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
advance of the program
 
04:16:32.870 --> 04:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
um that is the written testimony that
 
04:16:34.670 --> 04:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
Senator Ward wished me to share with the
 
04:16:36.050 --> 04:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
04:16:38.210 --> 04:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
um I respectfully would not like to take
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
any questions because I do not wish to
 
04:16:42.410 --> 04:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
speak much more for Senate award at this
 
04:16:42.420 --> 04:16:43.130 align:start position:0%

time

04:16:43.130 --> 04:16:43.140 align:start position:0%

and policy department at unh
 
04:18:36.710 --> 04:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
although before I share my comments that
 
04:18:38.269 --> 04:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sharing my own personal and
 
04:18:39.530 --> 04:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
professional views today and not
 
04:18:42.110 --> 04:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily those of the University
 
04:18:43.849 --> 04:18:43.859 align:start position:0%
I'm a lifelong New Hampshire resident
 
04:18:46.309 --> 04:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
and have long pursued outdoor recreation
 
04:18:49.130 --> 04:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
in many corners of the state moreover I
 
04:18:50.809 --> 04:18:50.819 align:start position:0%
used to work at the school and District
 
04:18:52.849 --> 04:18:52.859 align:start position:0%
levels in just the kinds of programs
 
04:18:55.670 --> 04:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
that section 5 of SB 148 would support
 
04:18:58.790 --> 04:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
and I now study outdoor education how
 
04:19:00.349 --> 04:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
outdoor education and Recreation
 
04:19:02.450 --> 04:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
supports Youth Development so I'm very
 
04:19:05.870 --> 04:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
pleased to see SB 148 before you today
 
04:19:07.849 --> 04:19:07.859 align:start position:0%
some of the recent papers my colleagues
 
04:19:09.710 --> 04:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
and I have published it have published
 
04:19:11.389 --> 04:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
indicate how youth from Northern New
 
04:19:13.010 --> 04:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire participate in outdoor
 
04:19:14.990 --> 04:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
activities at higher rates than their
 
04:19:17.389 --> 04:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
peers Nationwide the most highly
 
04:19:19.370 --> 04:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
involved youth not only reports stronger
 
04:19:20.809 --> 04:19:20.819 align:start position:0%
connections to their communities they
 
04:19:23.689 --> 04:19:23.699 align:start position:0%
also show more favorable post-secondary
 
04:19:26.689 --> 04:19:26.699 align:start position:0%
aspirations and after graduation attend
 
04:19:28.309 --> 04:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
college at higher rates
 
04:19:30.170 --> 04:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
our research also suggests
 
04:19:32.809 --> 04:19:32.819 align:start position:0%
unsurprisingly the rural youth evaluate
 
04:19:35.150 --> 04:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
their post-secondary options in light of
 
04:19:36.710 --> 04:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
their perceived opportunities for
 
04:19:38.330 --> 04:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
education and employment
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
in short youth can learn to love the
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
outdoors like I did as a kid growing up
 
04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
here but if there aren't viable
 
04:19:46.910 --> 04:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities for work along with ways
 
04:19:48.830 --> 04:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
to imagine yourself doing that work it's
 
04:19:50.030 --> 04:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
tough to know where to channel that
 
04:19:51.769 --> 04:19:51.779 align:start position:0%
interest and that passion
 
04:19:53.570 --> 04:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
fortunately the state is now wisely
 
04:19:55.790 --> 04:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
investing in outdoor recreation economic
 
04:19:57.889 --> 04:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
development in order to capitalize on
 
04:20:00.050 --> 04:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
the true New Hampshire Advantage our
 
04:20:01.849 --> 04:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
abundant outdoor amenities and strong
 
04:20:03.889 --> 04:20:03.899 align:start position:0%
outdoor culture
 
04:20:06.889 --> 04:20:06.899 align:start position:0%
this is why SB 148 is so critical and
 
04:20:09.349 --> 04:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
why I am compelled to comment today it
 
04:20:11.210 --> 04:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
can help connect those dots outdoor
 
04:20:12.950 --> 04:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
recreation as a growing economic engine
 
04:20:15.290 --> 04:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
on the one hand and the outdoors is a
 
04:20:17.090 --> 04:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
powerful venue for forming
 
04:20:19.010 --> 04:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
post-secondary aspirations on the other
 
04:20:22.070 --> 04:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
hand SB 148 will help schools and youth
 
04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
serving agencies align Behind These
 
04:20:26.030 --> 04:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
important state priorities and build a
 
04:20:27.889 --> 04:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
thriving citizenry and Workforce in New
 
04:20:29.809 --> 04:20:29.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whether directly in the
 
04:20:31.610 --> 04:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation economy or in other
 
04:20:31.620 --> 04:20:32.630 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation economy or in other
careers

04:20:32.630 --> 04:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
careers
 
04:20:35.450 --> 04:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
I think it is helpful to consider SB 148
 
04:20:38.030 --> 04:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
not merely as an education bill but as
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
an investment in the state's future
 
04:20:41.269 --> 04:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
Workforce and in the future adults who
 
04:20:42.830 --> 04:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
are committed to sustaining its quality
 
04:20:44.090 --> 04:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
of life
 
04:20:46.070 --> 04:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
in some my comments have not focused on
 
04:20:48.710 --> 04:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
this on any specific learning outcomes
 
04:20:50.269 --> 04:20:50.279 align:start position:0%
our schools per se
 
04:20:52.670 --> 04:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
but I want to emphasize the aspects of
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
the outdoors that support who people are
 
04:20:56.750 --> 04:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
and who they can become I can personally
 
04:20:58.429 --> 04:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
attest to the strong intergenerational
 
04:21:00.769 --> 04:21:00.779 align:start position:0%
bonds to New Hampshire that are promoted
 
04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
through early exposure to the outdoors
 
04:21:05.450 --> 04:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
and my research also shows how this
 
04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
influences the way young people think
 
04:21:08.689 --> 04:21:08.699 align:start position:0%
about their futures
 
04:21:10.370 --> 04:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm asking you to think about
 
04:21:12.950 --> 04:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
SB 148 as an investment into the future
 
04:21:15.050 --> 04:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire where opportunities are
 
04:21:16.910 --> 04:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
coming together to meet real educational
 
04:21:19.790 --> 04:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
outdoor and economic needs by promoting
 
04:21:21.530 --> 04:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
greater outdoor involvement among New
 
04:21:23.630 --> 04:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire youth thank you again for your
 
04:21:23.640 --> 04:21:24.530 align:start position:0%
Hampshire youth thank you again for your
time

04:21:24.530 --> 04:21:24.540 align:start position:0%

04:21:35.150 --> 04:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
I I do have one question for you
 
04:21:40.729 --> 04:21:40.739 align:start position:0%
um at UNH where you you are a professor
 
04:21:42.830 --> 04:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
um do they have a Parks and Recreation
 
04:21:44.630 --> 04:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
or do they have a recreation department
 
04:21:47.990 --> 04:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
which helps students be get into the
 
04:21:50.269 --> 04:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
careers associated with outdoor
 
04:21:53.330 --> 04:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
recreation or indoor Recreation as well
 
04:21:55.610 --> 04:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
we do that's my department where it's
 
04:21:57.110 --> 04:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's called the recreation management
 
04:21:59.750 --> 04:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
and Policy Department uh and we have
 
04:22:02.030 --> 04:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
three three what we call major options
 
04:22:03.769 --> 04:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
so it's one major with three different
 
04:22:05.929 --> 04:22:05.939 align:start position:0%
options students can elect to elect to
 
04:22:08.330 --> 04:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
choose uh one is therapeutic recreation
 
04:22:10.849 --> 04:22:10.859 align:start position:0%
uh and the another is program and event
 
04:22:12.710 --> 04:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
management so Festival planning and
 
04:22:14.269 --> 04:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
those types of careers and that often
 
04:22:16.550 --> 04:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
aligns with the hospitality and tourism
 
04:22:19.610 --> 04:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
Industries and then the the newest
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
development in that department is my
 
04:22:23.210 --> 04:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
option which is the Outdoor leadership
 
04:22:25.849 --> 04:22:25.859 align:start position:0%
and management department option and
 
04:22:28.670 --> 04:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
that uh service students who want to go
 
04:22:31.729 --> 04:22:31.739 align:start position:0%
either into uh outdoor guiding or

04:24:06.650 --> 04:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
Foundation and I am really speaking for
 
04:24:09.170 --> 04:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
myself I did learn a lot listening to
 
04:24:11.090 --> 04:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
people so to make sure that I'm not I
 
04:24:13.070 --> 04:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
don't get in trouble for advocating
 
04:24:16.010 --> 04:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
where I shouldn't Advocate I I'm going
 
04:24:19.729 --> 04:24:19.739 align:start position:0%
to say that um I don't uh I don't have a
 
04:24:21.769 --> 04:24:21.779 align:start position:0%
thought either way I think that's what
 
04:24:24.110 --> 04:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
the people before me said
 
04:24:27.769 --> 04:24:27.779 align:start position:0%
um but I do want to encourage you to
 
04:24:31.250 --> 04:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
support part five of this bill primarily
 
04:24:34.130 --> 04:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
because up here in the North country as
 
04:24:35.809 --> 04:24:35.819 align:start position:0%
was identified by one of the
 
04:24:37.910 --> 04:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
representatives or maybe it was the
 
04:24:37.920 --> 04:24:39.130 align:start position:0%
representatives or maybe it was the
senator

04:24:39.130 --> 04:24:39.140 align:start position:0%
senator
 
04:24:42.050 --> 04:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
we have a huge outdoor recreation
 
04:24:46.490 --> 04:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
industry and we also need more people to
 
04:24:50.090 --> 04:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
consider the workforce opportunities
 
04:24:53.389 --> 04:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
that that provides even if it's not
 
04:24:56.030 --> 04:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
their actual career but their volunteer
 
04:24:58.370 --> 04:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
service such as the Avalanche group the
 
04:25:01.570 --> 04:25:01.580 align:start position:0%
rescue group The stewardship of trails
 
04:25:04.490 --> 04:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
working with the different organizations
 
04:25:06.229 --> 04:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
that are putting millions of dollars
 
04:25:08.750 --> 04:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
into the trails and volunteering for
 
04:25:12.130 --> 04:25:12.140 align:start position:0%
that is so important and to create that
 
04:25:15.950 --> 04:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
desire I think that outdoor education
 
04:25:18.530 --> 04:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
and Environmental Education is very very
 
04:25:21.290 --> 04:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
important to help the students to
 
04:25:23.570 --> 04:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
understand the value of the world that
 
04:25:26.570 --> 04:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
they live in especially up here if
 
04:25:28.130 --> 04:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
they're going to make their lives up
 
04:25:28.140 --> 04:25:29.530 align:start position:0%
they're going to make their lives up
here

04:25:29.530 --> 04:25:29.540 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:25:32.090 --> 04:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they do leave but we find
 
04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
that they come back so being able to
 
04:25:37.070 --> 04:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
share that with them so that they begin
 
04:25:39.649 --> 04:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
to have a respect and a desire to
 
04:25:41.990 --> 04:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
protect where we live is very very
 
04:25:46.630 --> 04:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
important as my role as a trustee of the
 
04:25:49.849 --> 04:25:49.859 align:start position:0%
first public charter school that is
 
04:25:52.510 --> 04:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
Waldorf inspired and outdoor educated
 
04:25:56.870 --> 04:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
education I can attest to the value of
 
04:26:00.469 --> 04:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
outdoor education for the students for
 
04:26:03.110 --> 04:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
their desire to come to school the
 
04:26:06.170 --> 04:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
ability to stay outside and learn from
 
04:26:09.530 --> 04:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
the environment has been very key it is
 
04:26:11.809 --> 04:26:11.819 align:start position:0%
part of our curriculum but of course now
 
04:26:14.929 --> 04:26:14.939 align:start position:0%
with covid uh you've seen many many many
 
04:26:17.269 --> 04:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
schools have picked up on the idea of
 
04:26:19.610 --> 04:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
outdoor education so I just wanted to
 
04:26:22.070 --> 04:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
