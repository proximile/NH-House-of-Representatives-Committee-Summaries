i think it'd be better to look at than
 
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
something else and it took me a while
 
00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
because i had to find one that was made
 
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
in the united states
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
so i found one and now we don't need the
 
00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
mass anymore so i guess that's good for
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
for all of us but i at least had to show
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
it's a courtesy to everyone if you would
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%

glance at it
 
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
i have to credit our chairman for doing
 
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.070 align:start position:0%
i have to credit our chairman for doing
the

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
thinking for most of this i got my name
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
on it but
 
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
he did a lot of the work i know for
 
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.589 align:start position:0%
he did a lot of the work i know for
myself

00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
the public hearing i think we were
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
generally in favor of this bill but
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
there were a few
 
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
concerns raised during the hearing there
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
were some others that came up afterwards
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
and so i wanted to take a closer look at
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
our chairman actually did as we often
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
like to do on this committee he
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
contacted the department of labor
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
and asked them uh how big is this
 
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.589 align:start position:0%
and asked them uh how big is this
problem

00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
is this uh is this a common issue and
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
their answer was
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
they cited about a dozen issues
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
related to coven 19 not necessarily
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily this specific issue anything
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
from the vaccines to the testing to
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
are you on the clock when you go off to
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
get your test
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not clear to me that they
 
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.470 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not clear to me that they
have

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
actually had issues exactly like what
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
we're addressing in this bill
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
what they did say though is if someone
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
does come to them and says hey
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
my employer required me to go get a test
 
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
and when i came back he said
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
they're not paying for it they would say
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
that's not right
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
the law requires that employers
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
pay for any medical examination that
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
they require
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
so with that information the chairman
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
called a meeting with the senator
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill and we had some
 
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.670 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill and we had some
discussions

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
and uh actually he suggested wouldn't
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
this be simpler if we just replace all
 
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.030 align:start position:0%
this be simpler if we just replace all
that

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
added language with one word test
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
and uh one of the senators said i was
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
just going to say the same thing
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
so that's what i have drafted instead of
 
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
a new
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
section which adds some specific
 
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.389 align:start position:0%
section which adds some specific
language

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh to deal with covid19
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
and actually duplicates a paragraph
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's already in the law
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
we added with this amendment we would
 
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
add one more word
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
test to medical examination and
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
records as the things that if an
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
employer requires from an employee
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
they also have to pay for it as i said
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
from the department of labor standpoint
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
this is how they would apply the
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
existing law so it's not really a change
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
but what we did hear from the senators
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
is they believe
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
there is some confusion out there and
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
some disagreement on what the existing
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
law means
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
and this would clarify it it also is not
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
specific to
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
coven 19 anymore if there's a cove at 22
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
it would also apply if there's any other
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
medical issues
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
it makes clear as the department already
 
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.310 align:start position:0%
it makes clear as the department already
uh

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
and would enforce that medical testing
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
is part and parcel of a medical
 
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.910 align:start position:0%
is part and parcel of a medical
examination

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
examination
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
so i ask you please adopt this amendment
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman um i have a
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
question relating to the executive
 
00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:29.590 align:start position:0%
question relating to the executive
orders

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
orders
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
if the government requires a negative
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
test coming back from vacation for
 
00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
a possible exposure and the employer has
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
to require that will the employer have
 
00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:41.590 align:start position:0%
to require that will the employer have
to

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
again pay for that test even though it's
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
do it is the understanding of the
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and the vice chairman
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
in our communications with the
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
department of labor that they
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
do consider that to be the current law
 
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.990 align:start position:0%
do consider that to be the current law
now

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
that is how questions were brought are
 
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
brought to them by an
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
employer or an employee they would state
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
that that's what they feel
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
rsa 275 colon 3
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
states and all we are doing is trying to
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
codify that and make it more specific
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
the answer to your direct answer to your
 
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman thank you mr chairman
 
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
here uh representative on avelani's
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
question again please
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
representative would you please um
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
repeat your question one more time for
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
yes um if uh an employee doesn't require
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
a covet test to return to work
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
if there is something that happened
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
outside of their location
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
you know they went to a family wedding
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
they went on vacation yet
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
the executive orders require a negative
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
test to return to work or negative
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
testing not quarantine or a negative
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
test to
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
anything like that is the employer going
 
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
to have to pay for that negative test
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
pay for that test in order in order for
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
them to return to work even though it is
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
and uh why i'm not the department of
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman is that okay uh
 
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman is that okay uh
representative

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
yes it was thank you very much
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman in answer to that
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
the representative has probably hit on a
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
gray area that
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
department of labor would have to
 
00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:41.509 align:start position:0%
department of labor would have to
address

00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
i think you are first of all i
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct that
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't change
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
they would address that in a certain way
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not entirely sure what it was
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
this bill wouldn't change that uh the
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
way the law applies
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
but it is an interesting question what
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
if the employer doesn't require it but
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
some other entity does
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
at what point does it become um
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
as the language says a a condition of
 
00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:12.710 align:start position:0%
as the language says a a condition of
employment

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
employment
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
and i i don't know if we have enough
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
getting back to we have a motion motion
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
on the floor
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
of to pass an amendment um
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take other questions uh
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
also um you're
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
allowed now this is the time period to
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
you to speak in favor or against the
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
bill representatives
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
didn't say what other entity would
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
i think his example was so there's a
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
state requirement that if you've
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
traveled out of state you must take the
 
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.389 align:start position:0%
traveled out of state you must take the
test

00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
before you return to work and that's not
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
me as the employer
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
requiring that but if i but state law
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
says that i have to
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
so am i requiring it or not and
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
and that i i don't know how to answer
 
00:16:06.839 --> 00:16:11.590 align:start position:0%
and that i i don't know how to answer
that

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
because the employer requires it that
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
the employer is paying
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
the same thing as a drug test like you
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
know if there was some
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
weird sort of chance for the state of
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire wants you to pass a
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
drug test in order to come back then
 
00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:26.389 align:start position:0%
drug test in order to come back then
this

00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
you know that's not on the employer
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
that's at the state i just i don't
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
think it's terribly great no i agree i
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
would think if the state requires the
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
employer to do it the employer would
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
then have to
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
um just a moment i have a representative
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
espicia and then representative
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%

members of the committee
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
um happy to answer any questions in
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
terms of the specific
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
question that's come up relative and to
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh if there was an order the
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
department's uh position on that would
 
00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:38.150 align:start position:0%
department's uh position on that would
the

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
whether the order is generated
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
ultimately from the state
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
or put in place by the employer if the
 
00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:45.350 align:start position:0%
or put in place by the employer if the
employee

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
would need that in order to work or if
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
was in some way facilitating that by
 
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
saying okay in order to come back to
 
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.390 align:start position:0%
saying okay in order to come back to
work

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to need that the department
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
would view that as employer
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
driven and it would be a condition of
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
employment at which point time again we
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
would say that
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh lab-80302 uh
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
would require that's an existing
 
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.669 align:start position:0%
would require that's an existing
regulation

00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
would require the employer to bear the
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
costs associated with that
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
as representative seaworth said earlier
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh the department views again
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
through uh 275 3
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
and lab-80302 that
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
this type of testing already should be
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
covered and paid for
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
by the employer certainly this could be
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
looked at as a clarification of that
 
00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:37.270 align:start position:0%
looked at as a clarification of that
however

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%

could if it's not ready at this point we
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
have an eta
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
i would anticipate um i don't it is not
 
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
ready right this minute
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
but i anticipate it's going to be ready
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
quite soon
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
okay i am reluctant to um have you
 
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:08.950 align:start position:0%

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
or discuss an amendment that is wrong
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
and that is why we noticed the amendment
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
was wrong
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
about half an hour 45 minutes ago
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
and i'm reluctant to have you do that
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
to bring up something that is not even
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
going to be discussed or or
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
accurate i understand the topic is the
 
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:36.830 align:start position:0%
accurate i understand the topic is the
wording

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
and can we recess this bill
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
work on the other one no i don't want
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
that all right
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to i think it's just
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
inappropriate folks i mean
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
the committee um
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
if you would like to hear the concept of
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
the and then wait for it or just wait
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%

to your motion
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
point of order yes
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
don't i understand that we should
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
dispose of the motion on the floor
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
before we take up another motion
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
that is going to pull out my
 
00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.310 align:start position:0%
that is going to pull out my
parliamentary

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
parliamentary
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
encyclopedia on the back of my head but
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
more often than not on the floor of the
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
house we have
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
a motion on the floor when a higher
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
emotion takes precedent
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
um it someone can someone can
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
tell me i'm wrong and i'm not going to
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
be offended
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh when a higher emotion comes forth
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
my understanding is it squashes the
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
amendment or the emotion on the floor am
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
i incorrect
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
i believe the higher motion on the floor
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
of the house is the tabling motion
 
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a tabling motion in
 
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.630 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a tabling motion in
committee

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%

thank you representative sullivan i need

but yes representative turcotte i don't
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
believe we have a motion on the floor
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
ought to pass the amendment and then it
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
was open to further
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%

that really improves the bill
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
a bill that we all seem to agree is a
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
good bill
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
and i would really hope that we could
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
just vote ought to pass on the amendment
 
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:02.549 align:start position:0%

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
there was a wording that questioned
 
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
that was incorrect by legislative
 
00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.149 align:start position:0%
that was incorrect by legislative
services

00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
in that part said it replaced the entire
 
00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:38.710 align:start position:0%
in that part said it replaced the entire
bill

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
well that's not what the goal was the
 
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
goal was to add an additional amendment
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
so um trying for the last
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
hour to get this done
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
and and uh i'd like to have that
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
either up or down if it can't be here in
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
the next 10 minutes then i'm gonna have
 
00:30:57.679 --> 00:30:58.149 align:start position:0%
the next 10 minutes then i'm gonna have
to

00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
continue with the and i'm gonna i won't
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
be able to accept this motion
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
or an additional amendment and then the
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
other things are open but uh
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
so uh representation has a resp um
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
clarification for us so so just to
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
clarify mr clerk
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
the motion to retain is not in order
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
because the motion is not higher motion
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
and otpa has to be dealt with first is
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay so if the otpa is withdrawn
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
from a speaker then another one can be
 
00:31:36.799 --> 00:31:39.029 align:start position:0%
from a speaker then another one can be
made

00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay so we can't retain it after the
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
otpa motion but if we withdraw the otpa
 
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:44.950 align:start position:0%
otpa motion but if we withdraw the otpa
motion

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
all right thank you all right
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
so we can the clerk said
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
otpa has to be dealt with in one form or
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
another before
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
we can uh either repeal otpa
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
and then do retain we can defeat an otpa
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
motion and then
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
um but we can't thank you very much
 
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
my question uh to the point of order
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
is it's my understanding
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding what we just did
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
was we did
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
pass representative seaworth's amendment
 
00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:42.549 align:start position:0%
pass representative seaworth's amendment
otp

00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:42.559 align:start position:0%
otp
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
with amendment we already passed that
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
we hadn't gotten to my amendment
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
so i don't know that mine is even a
 
00:32:52.399 --> 00:32:52.870 align:start position:0%
so i don't know that mine is even a
question

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
you may but i would rather get a five
 
00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:16.710 align:start position:0%
you may but i would rather get a five
minute

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
minute
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
if it's not here um i have to move on
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
call christina go to the elevator see
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
what you can get done to get this thing
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
in everyone's hands for the next five
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
minutes before we have to
 
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:44.510 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:49.269 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
we are at the point that any amendment
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
could be made or
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
the actual motion
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:38.389 align:start position:0%
 
as

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
brought forward three things can be done
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
number one
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
is open to other amendments if we have
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
an amendment to review
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
and pass and we can discuss it and
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
either approve it or not
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
we can take the existing bill as amended
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
representative's amendment and we can
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
vote on that
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
we can withdraw the off-capacity
 
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.710 align:start position:0%
we can withdraw the off-capacity
amendment

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
vote on that to withdraw it and then
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
retain the bill
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
i would like to do one of the first i'd
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
like to amend it
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
if we can't get the amendment in the
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
next five minutes or so ten minutes then
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry for interrupting i i was
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
thinking we already recessed but
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
i apologize uh you talked i'm really
 
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:51.589 align:start position:0%
i apologize uh you talked i'm really
fine

00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
and i i'm not 100 sure i've got this all
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
right because committees are different
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
than the house floor
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
but in order to get a bill in discussion
 
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
i made the motion ought to pass
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
and then offered an amendment to that
 
00:36:11.359 --> 00:36:12.069 align:start position:0%
and then offered an amendment to that
bill

00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
so the motion on the floor as we
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
discussed with the clerk was
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
the otpa
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
that i made at the very beginning to
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
bring the bill into discussion
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
and that's why the clerk said that in
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
order to
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
do anything different i have to withdraw
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
before we have to vote on it because i
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
already made
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.839 --> 00:37:06.829 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.839 --> 00:37:45.910 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.839 --> 00:38:44.829 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.839 --> 00:38:59.750 align:start position:0%
 
because

00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's like i used to get letters when i
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
was in the service that was like oh
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
thanks for uh volunteering for this
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
three-week off like i did not volunteer
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
for next
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
my brother was in the reserve after he
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
got out of the army and he got one of
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
those letters that was saying oh we're
 
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
looking for volunteers for that he was
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
out of the reserve
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.839 --> 00:40:01.750 align:start position:0%
 
cheers

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
actually it could have been worse
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
because public hearings the clerk has
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
more to do executive sessions you just
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
it's just recording the votes which
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
isn't too bad when it's a long public
 
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.510 align:start position:0%
isn't too bad when it's a long public
hearing

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anybody could hear it on
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
the on the zoom call
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
the chairman briefly came in and out he
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
said that the amendment is
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
done and he's just trying to get it
 
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
to us and
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.839 --> 00:43:19.750 align:start position:0%

00:43:38.839 --> 00:44:07.349 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.359 --> 00:45:16.829 align:start position:0%
 
get next

00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.839 --> 00:45:29.690 align:start position:0%
 
something

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:29.700 align:start position:0%

bill
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
and the amendment and the concept hasn't
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
changed although
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
maybe an error was corrected i
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know what's involved with final
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
fda approval
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
but i but i believe that the employers
 
00:49:24.319 --> 00:49:24.790 align:start position:0%
but i but i believe that the employers
and

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
other entities would use what's
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
available while you know
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
an emergency and uh what's what's
 
00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:32.470 align:start position:0%
an emergency and uh what's what's
available

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh maybe have provisional fda approval
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh much like the vaccine so i i would
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
have to vote against this amendment i
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
don't think it's necessary or conducive
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
first of all with this backup we gotta
 
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:48.309 align:start position:0%
first of all with this backup we gotta
uh

00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
why is this my name um
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
well i think any member representative
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
can make the motion
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
even though it's yours thank you
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized to
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh the vote let's open for further
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
amendment recognition
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
committing uh for your indulgence
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
um i would like to propose amendment
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
one seven five eight h
 
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
is that a second sec
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak to your motion thank
 
00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.309 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak to your motion thank
you

00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that i uh
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
was very very concerned about
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
is it being
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
used to force folks
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
to take an unproven
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
possibly dangerous injection
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
as a condition of work so what i wanted
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
happen here is just make it
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
so that and it's coveted 19 specific
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
um so to have that
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
not be a condition of employment
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
until it has got final
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
fda approval and the reason being is is
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
things like this take
 
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
five ten as many years because you need
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
to see the side effects you need to see
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
what's going on for all of these things
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
to come out
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
um once that has come out
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
this would be moved so this is just it's
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
a protection
 
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
for people who do not want to take
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
an unproven drug
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then i just added uh in the second
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
paragraph that paragraph one
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
should not apply to health care
 
00:51:47.119 --> 00:51:47.910 align:start position:0%
should not apply to health care
providers

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
because i know that that in many many
 
00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.349 align:start position:0%
because i know that that in many many
cases

00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
they have to do those things uh
 
00:51:53.839 --> 00:51:55.670 align:start position:0%
they have to do those things uh
regardless

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
so that's my amendment and if anybody
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
has any questions i'd be more than
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
entertain point of order mr chairman i
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.839 --> 00:52:26.950 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
because this mr german was a bill to
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
deal with the payment
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
for tests um and now we're introducing
 
00:52:35.839 --> 00:52:36.790 align:start position:0%
for tests um and now we're introducing
language

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh similar to some of the language
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
that's being introduced
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
or being considered as an amendment for
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
hb 155
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
for um relative to vaccines they're the
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
cova tests and vaccines are do
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
completely different things if this
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to be put somewhere else
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's got some legitimacy but i
 
00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:00.870 align:start position:0%
firmly believe that it's not your name
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:12.829 align:start position:0%
firmly believe that it's not your name
[Music]

00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
there payment for cobit 19 testing
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
now it's a completely different area i
 
00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
haven't eaten this great but
 
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes it's my understanding
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
chairman of the committee has ruled this
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
amendment germain
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
well i was thinking in the u.s to be
 
00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.390 align:start position:0%
well i was thinking in the u.s to be
recognized

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
thought process as to why i believe it's
 
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.069 align:start position:0%
thought process as to why i believe it's
true

00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
well i while this does say required
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
focus testing
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.839 --> 00:54:09.990 align:start position:0%
 
testing

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
i do believe because it's dealing with
 
00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:13.670 align:start position:0%
i do believe because it's dealing with
this

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
issue in there if this were just
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
any type of just generic testing i would
 
00:54:24.319 --> 00:54:25.589 align:start position:0%
any type of just generic testing i would
say

00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
right there
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
all right could you please proceed to
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
take down the uh
 
00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.799 --> 00:55:15.349 align:start position:0%
 
any

00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
i have to agree with representative
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
cahill actually i'd also agree with
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is germaine but
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
furthermore i think
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
i can support this bill as originally
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
amended earlier in this uh hearing
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
um i cannot support it with uh this
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
further amendment on it
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.030 --> 00:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um i definitely think that
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
amendment uh definitely adds value and
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
does make uh
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
things better i definitely think that we
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
should not be allowing employers outside
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
the specialized circumstance of
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
to require a vaccination that has not
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
gone through the
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
full battery of tests and been evaluated
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
for all the edge cases
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
and uh contrary indicators that will be
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
found in the
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
the final approval process and so i
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
support this amendment
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative speaker
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
followed by representative
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair i mean i i i
 
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
cannot support this amendment when we
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
when folks are denied you know
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
employment by their employers for far
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
less um than than this
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
i mean i understand employers have to
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
make this decision and that is
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
that is up to them and so i i just i
 
00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:53.910 align:start position:0%
that is up to them and so i i just i
can't

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
support some women in good faith
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
why do healthcare workers have to be
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
required to take the vaccine as a
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
condition of employment
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
if it's so darn dangerous when you know
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
we're i that that last line made me
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
think of
 
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
why we're creating a situation of
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
extended living circumstances
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
where some folks based on the condition
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
of employment would be required to get
 
00:57:18.069 --> 00:57:18.079 align:start position:0%
the vaccine
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
but not everybody else has to why is the
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
amendment the difference in his opinion
 
00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:42.150 align:start position:0%
amendment the difference in his opinion
between

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
final approval and final authorization
 
00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
yes um all drugs
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
have to go through a process this
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
particular one was fast-tracked
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
without any of the clinical backup and
 
00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
studies to make sure that there are no
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
horrible side effects
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to take its natural course
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
it's more just a comment i'm i i'm
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
frustrated by this amendment because
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why we have
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
hesitation with encouraging folks
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not i'm not a mandatory
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
vaccination person either but part of
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
the frustration is that
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know we have had
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
three by my count including this pieces
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
of legislation aimed at raising
 
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
questions over the safety
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh and the consistency of a vaccine that
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
has not had any major um
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
health issues in anybody that it's been
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
applied to
 
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
yeah it was the you know seven people
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
that got blood clots with the johnson
 
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
johnson vaccine
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
birth control gives people more blood
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
clots than that vaccine did
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm not gonna vote for the amendment
 
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:05.430 align:start position:0%
so i'm not gonna vote for the amendment
i'm

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
i'm angry because we are trying so hard
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
to get out of this pandemic and by
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
raising questions like this in these
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
hushed tones where we
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
just want to be concerned um it's it's
 
00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
raising doubts in people's minds that
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately don't need to be fair so
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
that's just my commentary on that
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments here in the
 
00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:37.510 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments here in the
llp

00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i'm not sure
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
my colleague from laconia has read the
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
package insert on any medications
 
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
or seed commercials you know there's
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
always a disclaimer
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
all medicines have side effects and
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
you know if you're allergic to this
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
ingredient or that ingredient you know
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
talk to your physician
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
the vaccines are very very safe uh
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
speaking from personal experience i've
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
had two doses with no issues at all
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
and i i can't support this amendment i'm
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
sorry we
 
01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
just for the record uh the safety of
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
these vaccines
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh is definitely a question uh my my
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
roommate uh took a trip to the booming
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
last week
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
was from the phone and ran into an old
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
friend of his uh
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
the guy's 30 year old daughter okay a
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%

01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
i mean my fear of the vaccine is just as
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you the chairman's going to um
 
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
give his opinion
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
um i have taken the vaccine
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
as you know i was always wearing these
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
things in this room even though i've
 
01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:22.150 align:start position:0%
things in this room even though i've
been

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
safe not to i have taken unbelievable
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
protocols and precautions i've been
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
around seven people
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
over the last year that were positive
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
including being with the speaker of the
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
house four days
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
before he passed um and i did not
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
contract at the best of my knowledge and
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to do that because i used
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes you saw me people laugh at me
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
that sometimes i wore two masks
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
at some of these events um i have taken
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
the vaccine
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
i have two um daughters
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
19 and 21 years of age one of them as a
 
01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
friend of the military
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
i told all the ladies in the military if
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
you're planning on having children the
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
next five years
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
don't take the vaccine this came from
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
the united states military within their
 
01:02:04.839 --> 01:02:06.549 align:start position:0%
the united states military within their
ranks

01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
ranks
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
people on the online doctors say oh it's
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
great don't worry
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
it's not going to deal with menstrual uh
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
cycles or or anything
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
or births other people say no don't take
 
01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:17.990 align:start position:0%
or births other people say no don't take
it

01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
we have a year to wait we're getting
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of data
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of people 100
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
million people have taken this
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
but my daughters have to take a vaccine
 
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
if they want to go back to college
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
they're questioning whether they want to
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
it's their bodies it's their thing we
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
always talk about this it's a woman's
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
body don't tell a woman what to do
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh don't make and don't inhibit people
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
from getting jobs minorities some
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
minorities are the ones not getting it
 
01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
they don't either have access to it or
 
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
they don't think they have access to it
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
so this it just surprises me
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
that the roles seem to be turned here
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
where the republicans want to make it
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
so if someone chooses not to have a
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
vaccine it's not impeding their ability
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
to get a job
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh which we're always accused of putting
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
things in place to people not be able to
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
get jobs
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
um 20 of the people won't get it
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
there's been 10 000 people in this
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
country that have gotten
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
coveted after receiving the vaccine
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think any of them have died or
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
maybe very few
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
so they're working and i would like
 
01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:35.349 align:start position:0%
so they're working and i would like
people

01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
to get vaccines i'm not going to tell my
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
daughters what to do
 
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
and i as an employer
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
we have 80 employees all across the
 
01:03:48.319 --> 01:03:49.589 align:start position:0%
we have 80 employees all across the
country

01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
the 10 or 15 here in new hampshire i
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
have a few of them that are not going to
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
take it
 
01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
they will not take the vaccine i'm not
 
01:03:59.829 --> 01:03:59.839 align:start position:0%
going to make their job predicated on
 
01:03:59.839 --> 01:04:00.150 align:start position:0%
going to make their job predicated on
them

01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
taking the vaccine i don't think that's
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
right as an employer
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
um so that is why i will be supporting
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
this i didn't expect it to come up i
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
didn't know
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
until a couple a day or so ago but um
 
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
the more i think about it i'm
 
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
this helps the people that don't want to
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
take it um
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
still retain a job i don't want people
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
coming to me
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
coming to this committee next year or
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
for you know i'm saying
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know our unemployment rate's higher
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
because these people won't take the
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
vaccine for their health reasons
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
yet or religious exemptions or whatever
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
so they can't get a job
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh those are my comments i one last one
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
from representatives
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh love one last comment and that
 
01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:45.510 align:start position:0%
uh love one last comment and that
representative

01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know uh legislature we have a member
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's a retired
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i will support
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment i think
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
i think when we talk about these things
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about individual liberty
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
and individual liberty belongs to the
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
person not to an organization
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
not to a company not to the government
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
it belongs to the person
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
and that person has a has the right to
 
01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
make a decision
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
on whether or not they would like any
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
type of medical intervention on their
 
01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.630 align:start position:0%
type of medical intervention on their
body

01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
so i will be supporting this amendment i
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
i know that i have had stories that have
 
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
been told to me by people that i know
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
who have taken this vaccine that had
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
some adverse re um
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
effects from it and i will say that a
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
male representative who i will not say
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
his name for privacy purposes was
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
at my home last weekend after receiving
 
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
the johnson johnson shot
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
and i had to make up a bed for him to
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
lay down in for several hours because it
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
basically just knocked him out
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
so um that i'll tell you that story i'm
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
not telling you who the person is
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
um uh i will be supporting this
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
amendment because i believe that it has
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
to do with individual liberty
 
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you any additional comments online
 
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just for
 
01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
clarification the vaccine
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
having side effects afterwards it's not
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
an indication
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
that it's secretly killing you um
 
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
i'm i've registered my frustration with
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
this earlier i think it's just
 
01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.270 align:start position:0%
this earlier i think it's just
incredible

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
incredible
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
that we've managed to nestle ourselves
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
in the incredibly incredibly thin
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%

01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%

people who in about 20 minutes or so are
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
going to say that we can't mandate
 
01:07:21.599 --> 01:07:23.510 align:start position:0%
going to say that we can't mandate
employers

01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
pay anymore because that's the decision
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
of that business owner
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
but also that business owner does not
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
have the freedom or
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
does not have the purview over their

business to
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
say no i don't want you know a risk of
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
coping coming back because this pandemic
 
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
has been so terrible
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
has killed so many people has done so
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
much untold
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
want to deal with this again

01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
than as was originally proposed in this
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan way
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
to do something good for folks who
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise would have their employers
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
shift costs onto them
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be a fun media conference
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
because you know
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's incredibly different so i
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
any other comments on uh in the lobby
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%

it's
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's really sad um i i
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
like we just poison pilled a good bill
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
which you know isn't the first time
 
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
we've done this
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
in the house it's not the first time
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
we've done it had happened in the senate
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
um you know in in the legislature we've
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
you know had a real a pretty good bill
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
that had bipartisan support and and just
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
see it you know
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know now just torn the flames
 
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
because of because
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
of some because of what
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%

01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%

representative out of it you're right
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's vastly different um
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
the way it is uh you can go out and
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
glide we're gonna have a
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
probably uh media conference
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
and confident however that with the way
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
the department of labor is
 
01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
adjudicating the uh request any way that
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
they will be requiring in the meantime
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the least requirement as they do now
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
the employer pay for this test
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
um see no other hands uh comments
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman um i
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
thought my last amendment was going to
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
be the easy part
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
i hope that is enough or telling of
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen here
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
um this amendment once again um
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
when we listened to this bill in the
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
there were a number of concerns some of
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
them i raised some of them i heard
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
around the table
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
some of them i heard from across the
 
01:18:07.199 --> 01:18:07.750 align:start position:0%
some of them i heard from across the
table

01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
i think i think both sides
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
were concerned about the way this bill
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
was worded
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
and um so with this amendment i tried to
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
simplify the language not really change
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
anything with the intent of the bill so
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
much but
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
try to clean up the language and some of
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
the confusing things were in there
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
um the first thing i did was uh
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
the the original bill did three things
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
more or less uh it it addressed this
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
45 percent number
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's in the bill for this base
 
01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:46.310 align:start position:0%
that's that's in the bill for this base
rate

01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
for tip wages it had its cigar bars
 
01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
as an employer who could use the tip
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
rate and it also
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
added employees who were licensed
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to use the tip rate and it
 
01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
was that last
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
piece that uh i found
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
convoluted the language and
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
after discussing with the bill's
 
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
sponsors and the supporters
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
um including uh the gentleman who was
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
representing the casinos
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh i felt it cleaned up the bill quite a
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
bit to remove that
 
01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
um i i won't go into the details but i'm
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
happy to answer more questions about
 
01:19:37.199 --> 01:19:39.030 align:start position:0%
happy to answer more questions about
that

01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
so those employees are removed from this
 
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:42.790 align:start position:0%
so those employees are removed from this
bill

01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
which greatly cleans up
 
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
the remaining elements i think it
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
simplifies it i
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
it makes it straightforward i also
 
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
kind of flipped around the way the
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
wording was done
 
01:19:59.709 --> 01:19:59.719 align:start position:0%
um the original bill emphasized that the
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
327 which is what 45 725
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
is and is the current law um
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
it emphasized that and as the department
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
of labor brought up that created a
 
01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:14.229 align:start position:0%
of labor brought up that created a
problem

01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
if the federal rate actually went up
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
higher than that
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
then it created this conflict where the
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
state law was one thing but the federal
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
law which really applies is different
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
so the language flips that around to
 
01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
make it clear that the federal law
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
is what applies except that we won't go
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
below the current rate
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
um so i think those
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
changes are straightforward i i think it
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
simplifies the bill
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
and we can discuss the the bill itself
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:55.910 align:start position:0%

my amendment is pretty simple um the
 
01:24:59.040 --> 01:24:59.669 align:start position:0%
my amendment is pretty simple um the
original

01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill thought that 725 was
 
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
good enough for some folks i think it's
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
good enough for everybody
 
01:25:09.189 --> 01:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
um 327 is
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
um a ridiculous joke and
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
i'll speak further to that after
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully this amendment has passed
 
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
um but we're talking about what's good
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
for some what's good for all
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh let's put everybody on the level
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
playing field in their opinion and pass
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
the uh is the floor is open for speaking
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
in favor or against the amendment are
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
there any comments or
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh here in the lob representative
 
01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.550 align:start position:0%

seaworth

01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
seaworth
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman um
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
i was happy to see that we got some
 
01:25:48.629 --> 01:25:48.639 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support for my amendment
 
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
but i have no illusions that that means
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
support for the bill i know we have some
 
01:25:59.110 --> 01:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of conflict over the
 
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
subject of minimum wage
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
and particularly the subject of tip
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
minimum wage there's a lot of opinions
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go out on a limb and i'm
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
going to say that i think
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
where this agreement is
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
and evidenced by uh the amendment from
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
my fellow representative
 
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
is that the 45 number it
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make sense um i
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
i think chair mr chairman you said we're
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
the only state in the nation that
 
01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:29.430 align:start position:0%
the only state in the nation that
actually

01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
tries to do this as a percentage why 45
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
that's really hard to justify i wasn't
 
01:26:36.719 --> 01:26:37.830 align:start position:0%
that's really hard to justify i wasn't
here

01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh when the 45 number was originally put
 
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
into law
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
i was here um when we
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
changed the minimum wage to tie it
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
directly to the federal rate
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
rather than kind of mirroring it with
 
01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
our own language
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
and i know we kept the 45 percent at
 
01:26:59.110 --> 01:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
that time
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
um and i can speculate as to why that
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
might have happened at that time
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
this was i think ten years ago if you
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
had said
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay the federal rate is going to go up
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
um what might it go up to eight dollars
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
might have been a good guess
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
as to what to expect next at the federal
 
01:27:18.159 --> 01:27:18.870 align:start position:0%
as to what to expect next at the federal
level

01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
and when you apply the 45 to 8
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
that's a 30 increase in the tip rate
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
and you know is that the right number
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
does it really matter when you're
 
01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
talking about 30 cents
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
20 cents nowadays
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
eight dollars i would say is next to
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
impossible to see that
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
as as the proposal for what the minimum
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
wage should be
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
um and and certainly during the
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
the hearing we talked about what's
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
currently on
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
um being proposed at the federal level
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
but really it could be anything and i
 
01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:56.639 align:start position:0%
think we need to anticipate that it
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
could be 9
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
10 12 15. we had a bill that was 23.50
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
which the 45 would drive it up
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
then to 11 something would be our our
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
tip minimum wage
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh which is a lot more than any of our
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
neighboring states and it could be
 
01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.669 align:start position:0%
neighboring states and it could be
devastating

01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
devastating
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
for the hospitality
 
01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
industry so
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
the argument then is what is the right
 
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.830 align:start position:0%
the argument then is what is the right
number

01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
and i i
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
don't like the characterization that
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
we're telling everybody to
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
to pay 327 that is what it is now
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
and the way this is written is it sets
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
a floor to that but if the feds
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
and it's still below 327 that we don't
 
01:28:51.679 --> 01:28:51.990 align:start position:0%
and it's still below 327 that we don't
go

01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
down to their rate that we only go up to
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
their new rate
 
01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
i think that's a conservative way to
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
the simple fact that we don't know
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
with federal law and
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
trying to pass something that
 
01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
anticipates that that anticipates
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
what the other states in new england
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
might do as a reaction
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
um i think it's difficult and so that's
 
01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
why i propose and i will continue to
 
01:29:21.679 --> 01:29:22.629 align:start position:0%
why i propose and i will continue to
support

01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
this conservative approach that does the
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
same thing with the tip rate
 
01:29:29.110 --> 01:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
follows the federal rate that we do with
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
the the minimum
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know that
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
725 is is
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
and that's one number it
 
01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
we could debate where it should be um
 
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
the other thing though that i want to
 
01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
bring up
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
is we're not setting that as a rate for
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
people to be paid right now
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
um tipped employees some do get 7.25
 
01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
some get something between 7 25 and 327.
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
some probably do get 327 but we're not
 
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
driving everybody to one rate we're
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
setting an absolute
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
floor in line with what what federal law
 
01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.110 align:start position:0%
floor in line with what what federal law
does

01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
um just i
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
happen to present my version of the
 
01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.270 align:start position:0%
happen to present my version of the
amendment

01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
to the representative for the cigar bars
 
01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:34.719 align:start position:0%
and he said that they for one have no
 
01:30:34.719 --> 01:30:35.990 align:start position:0%
and he said that they for one have no
intention

01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
intention
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
of lowering the rate that they pay their
 
01:30:38.639 --> 01:30:39.990 align:start position:0%
of lowering the rate that they pay their
bartenders

01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
bartenders
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
just because we authorize it
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i i think that's the way we have to
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
look at this this is a
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
anything with minimum wage is a floor
 
01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a wage that we're requiring
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
the is in which i saw them raised were
 
01:31:05.110 --> 01:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
attitude and then
 
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh turcotte followed by love and then
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
we'll go online
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i believe the
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
bipartisan agreement
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
in the vote a few minutes ago was more
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
intended to
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
clean up the language um that we all
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
agreed during the public hearing was a
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
little duplicatous
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
um the the reason why i put
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
um 725 in there
 
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
in instead of 45 in a perfect world
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
i would prefer the 45 or 45 number to be
 
01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:36.629 align:start position:0%
i would prefer the 45 or 45 number to be
there

01:31:36.629 --> 01:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
um because i think that
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
um you know makes it easier as a
 
01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:43.430 align:start position:0%
um you know makes it easier as a
percentage

01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
for the tipped minimum wage to keep
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
track with
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
whatever the federal is um but 725
 
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
was in the bill in a different point
 
01:31:59.110 --> 01:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
regarding the charitable gaming folks so
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
um versus proposing an amendment
 
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
that was just literally the text in the
 
01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.229 align:start position:0%
that was just literally the text in the
rsa

01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
um i provided a germain amendment um
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
and tried to loop everybody up to the
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
language that
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
so i that that's the situation on that
 
01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
my colleagues um recognition of a little
 
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
bipartisanship but i think a lot of that
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
was more
 
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
um inclined at cleaning up the two
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
paragraphs that were the exact same as
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
each other
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
you're right thank you chairman
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
um just uh question for the maker
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh in lines 10 through 13
 
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
much like the original bill that came
 
01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
out of the senate uh
 
01:32:51.510 --> 01:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
it appears we have paragraph in 10
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
through 13 that
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
for all intents and purposes is exactly
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
the same as 13 through 16.
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
when i asked senator bradley about that
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
his comment was
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
you know you guys can fix that so seeing
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
this and your amendment
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
is there a difference is there the
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
intent to be a difference
 
01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
or is it a oversight
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh nope i think that unfortunately
 
01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
was a different drafting error i don't
 
01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
know why that wasn't
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
there when i went through it i purposely
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
yeah it's the same drafting as the
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
initial one thank you
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
and continue on i i'll be against this
 
01:33:36.159 --> 01:33:36.870 align:start position:0%
and continue on i i'll be against this
uh

01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
amendment i think one of the things we
 
01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:40.310 align:start position:0%
amendment i think one of the things we
lose

01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
lose
 
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
track of or lose sight of here we've got
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
a state minimum tipped wage a federal
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
minimum tipped wage nobody
 
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
ever ever makes below the minimum wage
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
set at the federal level
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
because if the tip wage if they if they
 
01:33:59.669 --> 01:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
don't get
 
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
make the minimum of 725 an hour the
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
difference is always made up
 
01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
that is very very rare to begin with so
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
nobody's ever gonna in a tipped
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
wage is ever gonna make less than 725 an
 
01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:11.590 align:start position:0%
wage is ever gonna make less than 725 an
hour

01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
hour
 
01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
and it's been in testimony after
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
testimony here
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
we know that most tipped employees get
 
01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:18.390 align:start position:0%
we know that most tipped employees get
somewhere

01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
north of 20 some as high as 30 and some
 
01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:21.990 align:start position:0%
north of 20 some as high as 30 and some
even

01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
more when uh you look at some of the
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
higher end restaurants so i'll be
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%

uh thank you mr chairman um just for
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
clarification how would
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
a minimum wage paid employee as of today
 
01:34:58.950 --> 01:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
if this was to pass and become law
 
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative you broke up
 
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
significantly could you please ask
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
my apologies mr chairman um if we move
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
if this
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
amendment passes and the bill becomes
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
law as of this year
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
how how would the irs rules and
 
01:35:26.229 --> 01:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
regulations for shipped employees
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
work if the chip employee now makes
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
minimum wage how would they be required
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
to claim any tips above and beyond
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
i i can only venture a guess i'm not an
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
irs agent nor do i
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
understand all the rules and laws but
 
01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
there are people currently paying get
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
there are currently individuals that are
 
01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
making more than 327 an hour
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
for tipped employees as tipped employees
 
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
just for their base rate from their
 
01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
employer and then their tips on top of
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
that so i'm sure it's
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
still still legal regardless but
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
i can't answer your question qualified
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
tax preparer or
 
01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
irs representative
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
have any other um you have any other
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
hearing none representative love and
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
then i'm looking for additional hands
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
online representative love you
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%

i'll be voting against this amendment um
 
01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
i believe in letting the market dictate
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
the cost of labor or across the products
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
um you know it kind of reminds me in
 
01:36:46.239 --> 01:36:47.030 align:start position:0%
um you know it kind of reminds me in
order

01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:36:49.590 --> 01:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
to start off with you know for those of
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
us that are old enough to remember
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
the recessions in the 70s just sort of
 
01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:55.830 align:start position:0%
the recessions in the 70s just sort of
devastating

01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
devastating
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
businesses and not only knows if we're
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
going back lately
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
you know uh back in the 70s i was i was
 
01:37:02.719 --> 01:37:04.149 align:start position:0%
you know uh back in the 70s i was i was
driving

01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
driving
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
and it was a union job we were out on
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
strike and we went over to my
 
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
grandfather's house
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
you know i'm a young kid jumping up and
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
down we're going to get this we're going
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
the boss can't make the money nobody's
 
01:37:20.229 --> 01:37:20.239 align:start position:0%
making money we're gonna make sure the
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
bosses can still make money
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a delicate balance
 
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
that we can't uh we can't
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
ignore you know if we can get 25 for a
 
01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:29.669 align:start position:0%
ignore you know if we can get 25 for a
hamburger

01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
hamburger
 
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
because the dishwasher is making 7.25 or
 
01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:55.830 align:start position:0%
because the dishwasher is making 7.25 or
more

01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
i don't see any additional questions
 
01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:00.550 align:start position:0%
i don't see any additional questions
online

01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%

final bill turn everybody's attention to
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
the newsweek article that i attached to
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%

that's titled denny's shareholders
revolt

01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
revolt
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
after top executive concedes 15
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
minimum wage won't hurt businesses the
 
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
article is about how
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
investors in the company denny's are
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
trying to leave the national
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
restaurant association because the
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
national restaurant association is
 
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
talking out of both sides of their mouth
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
telling the investors that actually a 15
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
an hour minimum wage and one wage for
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
everybody is
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
not gonna you know have cats and dogs
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
living together and fire breathing down
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
from the sky
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
and then lobbying politicians that
 
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
actually in fact it's going to be the
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
end of days
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
so uh before we discuss that further i
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to take that opportunity to
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
bring that up
 
01:39:10.709 --> 01:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
so that we're all having the same
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
discussion in a couple of minutes
 
01:39:16.629 --> 01:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative paul thank you
 
01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to say um
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
from the testimony that we got on this
 
01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:23.990 align:start position:0%
from the testimony that we got on this
bill

01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
our senator and the bill sponsor
 
01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0%
said in his testimony the raise of in
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
the required minimum wage
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
employees could manifest in a doubling
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
of that wage
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
this is almost what my colleague from
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
grafton county
 
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
is alluding to in his amendment um
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
the senator also went on to say it would
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
create duress and pressure on business
 
01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:47.510 align:start position:0%
create duress and pressure on business
establishments

01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
that would have the potential to put
 
01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
businesses out of business it would
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
reduce employee hours and create
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
job loss this is the author of the bill
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
warning against
 
01:39:58.870 --> 01:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
a higher rate and for that reason i am
 
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
i applaud you for submitting your
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
amendment uh
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
i find it interesting and i had this
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
conversation with representative
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
sullivan on the phone yesterday or the
 
01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
this concept of getting rid of the 45
 
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:40:36.629 --> 01:40:36.639 align:start position:0%
passed around this legislature for a
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
number of years
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
most recently presented by senator donna
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
soucy my senator
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
um and actually i was surprised that
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
republicans wanted to vote for this
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
the democrats really didn't want to vote
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
for it because
 
01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
this makes it easier quite frankly
 
01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
to increase the minimum wage
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
because every time we have a minimum
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
wage issue
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
the biggest barkers are the tipped
 
01:41:04.639 --> 01:41:05.590 align:start position:0%
the biggest barkers are the tipped
employee

01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
owners because of the 45
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
and it precludes the minimum wage from
 
01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
going up
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
because that's always the that that the
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
tip part is always a problem
 
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
that's always the 45 oh we can't do that
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
they're already making more about well
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's always the problem
 
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
when you separate these into two
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
different things
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
it makes it easier to maybe you can
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
include increase one or maybe the other
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
or both whereas before it had to be both
 
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
so it actually makes it easier faster
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
senator susie's bill had the minimum
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
wage increase to 12
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
with the tip weighs to four dollars
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
in her bill that passed the democrat-led
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
house and democrat
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
senate last year um
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
and it included getting rid of this 45
 
01:41:59.590 --> 01:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
they were going to be their own separate
 
01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:02.149 align:start position:0%
they were going to be their own separate
things

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:07.590 --> 01:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
so now the same thing has been proposed
 
01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
except brazil which i think we all can
 
01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:14.629 align:start position:0%
except brazil which i think we all can
agree

01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
agree
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
are raised by marketing and we're
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
already pretty much
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
there 4 and 12. so
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's interesting to keep the eye on the
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
ball of the concept here
 
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
we're adding we're having discussions
 
01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:34.109 align:start position:0%
we're adding we're having discussions
about

01:42:34.109 --> 01:42:34.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
327 725
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
for the tip 725 whatever the concept
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
here that needs is the 45
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
getting rid of that allows this
 
01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:48.790 align:start position:0%
getting rid of that allows this
legislature

01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
a lot easier time to increase the
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
minimum wage should they see fit
 
01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
but i'll talk more about it in the final
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
bill but i hope my colleagues
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
keep the eye on this minimum wage
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
is being is a lot higher than the 725
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
even the tip ways people are paying more
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
i'll give examples of that when we have
 
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
our final discussion
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
real life stories here in the state of

is hoping for comments
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i'd like to
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
speak to my motion briefly here and
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
first of all i apologize to any
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
colleagues that i
 
01:48:06.870 --> 01:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
was putting words in their mouth or
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts in their head i certainly
 
01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't trying to do that i was
 
01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
going to be a little funny and maybe
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
failed um
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
but what's important to me here is that
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
again as i said before i know we have a
 
01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
very contentious debate going on
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
in this house going on in this country
 
01:48:26.719 --> 01:48:27.910 align:start position:0%
in this house going on in this country
about

01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
um what the minimum wage should be
 
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
and uh that
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
seeps into the argument over this bill
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
but it is my belief that's
 
01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
not what this bill is about um
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
to me the bill is about the 45 percent
 
01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:46.390 align:start position:0%
to me the bill is about the 45 percent
um

01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
whether that's appropriate and i don't
 
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
think it is and i think it's important
 
01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
that we remove the 45 percent number
 
01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
um before it comes and and does
 
01:48:58.719 --> 01:48:59.750 align:start position:0%
um before it comes and and does
something

01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
terrible to our businesses and it really
 
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know i i think we all got an email
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
from a restaurant owner
 
01:49:12.149 --> 01:49:12.159 align:start position:0%
that talked about what the catastrophic
 
01:49:12.159 --> 01:49:12.790 align:start position:0%
that talked about what the catastrophic
effects

01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
effects
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
could be if a huge
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
increase to this tipped rate
 
01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
comes through and
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
the problem is we don't know what could
 
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
happen we've got this percentage that
 
01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
automatically calculates
 
01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
the tip rate without any deliberation
 
01:49:40.390 --> 01:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
on the part of this legislature and i
 
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
think that's the problem
 
01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
that needs to be fixed as i said before
 
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
and i won't dwell on it um
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
i think focusing on the 327
 
01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
is not the way to read this bill what
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
does is sets our state minimum rate to
 
01:50:02.229 --> 01:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
match the federal minimum rate
 
01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
just as it is with the
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
minimum wage itself again i understand
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
that this is a contentious issue
 
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
we could debate whether that's the right
 
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
thing to do or the wrong thing to do
 
01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
in my opinion that's not the focus of
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
the bill the focus of the bill is the 45
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
number i don't know if the chairman was
 
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
get me to waver in my support uh he may
 
01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
have a point that taking the 45 percent
 
01:50:29.599 --> 01:50:30.390 align:start position:0%
have a point that taking the 45 percent
away

01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
removes one of the big roadblocks to
 
01:50:34.149 --> 01:50:34.159 align:start position:0%
getting a minimum
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
a state minimum wage wrong pass um
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
that that could be a that's a good point
 
01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
because the 45
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
has this unintended consequence of
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
maybe a reasonable change to the minimum
 
01:50:50.159 --> 01:50:50.870 align:start position:0%
maybe a reasonable change to the minimum
wage

01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
wage
 
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
could be a very
 
01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
critical change to this subset of
 
01:50:58.390 --> 01:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
businesses that's relying
 
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
on this formula that the feds have
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
for crediting tips against the minimum
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
wage and calculating what needs to be in
 
01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
the paycheck
 
01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
but he did not convince me i am still
 
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
advocating for my bill to pass his
 
01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:14.629 align:start position:0%
advocating for my bill to pass his
amendment

01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:51:17.669 --> 01:51:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know if i can get any
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh votes to swing my way but i'll ask
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
and i i hope we don't get into too much
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
of a debate about
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
setting the minimum wage because once
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
again i i don't think that's the purpose
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
finally one thing i pointed out in the
 
01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
email and i'll emphasize
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
it again just in case it's missed
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
is this not on the amendment page but in
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
the original bill there's a clause that
 
01:51:43.109 --> 01:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
says this
 
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
does not take effect until the
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
federal government changes the minimum
 
01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:51.990 align:start position:0%
federal government changes the minimum
wage

01:51:51.990 --> 01:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
wage
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
and that's i think we need to keep that
 
01:51:56.070 --> 01:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
in mind that
 
01:51:58.629 --> 01:51:58.639 align:start position:0%
passing this does absolutely nothing in
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
things remain exactly as they are until
 
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
it is triggered by action at the federal
 
01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:08.470 align:start position:0%
it is triggered by action at the federal
government

01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i think we need to see what that
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
action is
 
01:52:16.470 --> 01:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
before we decide
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
our current law good enough or
 
01:52:21.669 --> 01:52:21.679 align:start position:0%
or do we need to make further changes
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you mr
 
01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
i would like to agree with my colleague
 
01:52:30.070 --> 01:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
about the purpose of that the main focus
 
01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
of this bill is the elimination of the
 
01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:32.550 align:start position:0%
of this bill is the elimination of the
45

01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
45
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
however that's not the way the sponsor
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
presented it to us the way the sponsor
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
presented it to us was
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
this is an effort to freeze the tips
 
01:52:41.589 --> 01:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
minimum wage at 327
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
so um i would like to see it
 
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
through that lens however i'm gonna go
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
with the way that uh
 
01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
senator bradley talked about it and
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
brought it to us um
 
01:52:53.589 --> 01:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
today i'm asking the labor committee to
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
vote against the otpa motion
 
01:52:57.709 --> 01:52:57.719 align:start position:0%
because put simply the bill is
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
quasi-constitutional and it is
 
01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
good for anybody involved on the issue
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
of constitutionality the bill will be
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
by my count the fourth piece of
 
01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
legislation advanced in this body that
 
01:53:10.229 --> 01:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
seems to preemptively nullify federal
 
01:53:10.239 --> 01:53:10.950 align:start position:0%
seems to preemptively nullify federal
law

01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
supremacy clause constitution clearly
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
states that so long as a federal law
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
does not violate the constitution
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
it takes effect over a conflicting state
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
law sponsor of the bill even agreed to
 
01:53:22.390 --> 01:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
as much when he testified before the
 
01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:23.189 align:start position:0%
as much when he testified before the
committee

01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:53:26.070 --> 01:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
when he said quote if the feds raise the
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
tipped minimum wage
 
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
this conversation is over if the minimum
 
01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:31.510 align:start position:0%
this conversation is over if the minimum
wage

01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
wage
 
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
were to increase the tipped one would
 
01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:34.709 align:start position:0%
were to increase the tipped one would
absolutely

01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh take precedent and we know this
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
because as was explained to us in
 
01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
hearing the raise the wage act
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
does include an increase to the tips
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
already zeroing out this language
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
leaving redundant language in the rsas
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
that strikes at the tenants of
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
federalism in my opinion is
 
01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:53.669 align:start position:0%
federalism in my opinion is
counterproductive

01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
counterproductive
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
why would we pass a bill that the
 
01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor acknowledges has a slim
 
01:54:00.070 --> 01:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
chance of relevancy on the issue of why
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
the bill isn't good for anybody involved
 
01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
i want to bring some data into this
 
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
conversation according to the national
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
restaurant association statistics
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
from 2017 and 2018 states where there is
 
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
no sub
 
01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
minimum wage are experiencing better or
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
the same restaurant growth
 
01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
as states without them in fact as i
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
alluded to
 
01:54:23.669 --> 01:54:23.679 align:start position:0%
the restaurant chain denny's is trying
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
to leave the
 
01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
national restaurant association after
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
their shareholders had to admit
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
to their investors that the minimum wage
 
01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
increase has been good for business
 
01:54:36.229 --> 01:54:36.239 align:start position:0%

varistak
 
01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
told investors that the california law
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
raising the minimum wage to 15
 
01:54:51.589 --> 01:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
an hour by 2023 has actually been
 
01:54:54.070 --> 01:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
good for the diner chain as they've
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
increased their minimum wage kind of in
 
01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
a tempered pace over the time frame
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
if you look at that time frame from us
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
california has outperformed the system
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
over that time frame they had six
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
consecutive years of positive
 
01:55:10.709 --> 01:55:10.719 align:start position:0%
guest traffic not just positive sales
 
01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679 align:start position:0%
but positive guest traffic as the
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
minimum wage was going up
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
more people were participating at the
 
01:55:20.070 --> 01:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
restaurant then prior
 
01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
when the sponsor came to the committee
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
he said well if you raise the minimum
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
wage it'll lead to more automation
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
and i have heard the lore of the
 
01:55:29.189 --> 01:55:29.199 align:start position:0%
mcdonald's robots for as long as i've
 
01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
been alive
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
and now mcdonald's is offering
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
applicants iphones in some places to
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
work for them
 
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
because they so desperately need people
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
the sponsor said well if you raise the
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
minimum wage those places won't be able
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
to hire employees
 
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
now they can't hire employees because
 
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
some folks look at the possibility of
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
people getting paid in such a way that
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
they aren't the first generation of
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
americans in history
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
worse off than their parents and they
 
01:55:54.070 --> 01:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
say how can we possibly pay these people
 
01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:54.950 align:start position:0%
say how can we possibly pay these people
less

01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
the restaurant owners association raised
 
01:55:57.119 --> 01:55:57.990 align:start position:0%
the restaurant owners association raised
concerns

01:55:57.990 --> 01:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
that this is unnecessary because the
 
01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
average worker makes
 
01:56:04.709 --> 01:56:04.719 align:start position:0%
over 20 an hour with tips to which i say
 
01:56:06.149 --> 01:56:06.159 align:start position:0%
please explain to me how one can
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
simultaneously believe that we have to
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
end the unemployment benefits early for
 
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
15 000 people
 
01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
because that measly 300 a week benefit

because that measly 300 a week benefit

quote
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
pays more than working does but working
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
also somehow pays 800
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
a week doesn't make a lot of sense to me
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is that these
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
people do
 
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
hard work i know a lot of people think
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
that being a server or a cook is easy
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
but it is not running around on your
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
feet dealing with impolite
 
01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
and sometimes downward cruel customers
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
who take pride in the fact that they
 
01:56:36.629 --> 01:56:36.639 align:start position:0%
don't tip
 
01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
and all the other stuff they're forced
 
01:56:40.229 --> 01:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
to put up with to maybe get a 5
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
tip is ludicrous you just raise the menu
 
01:56:44.229 --> 01:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
prices a little bit
 
01:56:46.229 --> 01:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
which will not impact your customer base
 
01:56:48.070 --> 01:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
as was alluded to in the article
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
because eating out is still a fun thing
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
that people will do even if the chicken
 
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
salad goes from 9.99 to 10.99
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
and give your staff the security
 
01:57:01.109 --> 01:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
of a paycheck that they can reasonably
 
01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
plan on
 
01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of every week so that they
 
01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
may budget
 
01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
and i promise you they will be happier
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
to work
 
01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
for you folks know that i love to weave
 
01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
historical themes into my remarks so i'd
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
like to close out this
 
01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh with this incredibly relevant quote
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
by president franklin roosevelt
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
do not let any calamity howling
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
executive with an
 
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
income of a thousand dollars a day who
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
has been turning his employees over to
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
the government relief roles in order to
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
preserve his company's undistributed
 
01:57:30.239 --> 01:57:31.189 align:start position:0%

01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
reserves
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
tell you that a wage of 11 a week is
 
01:57:36.070 --> 01:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
going to have a disastrous effect on all
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
american industry
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you and i do

01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
oh okay representative seaworth and i'm
 
01:57:48.310 --> 01:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
going to ask people online all right
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i i do have a
 
01:57:51.119 --> 01:57:52.229 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i i do have a
question

01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:57:56.229 --> 01:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
um about your your comment you mentioned
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
the potential constitutionality issue
 
01:58:03.189 --> 01:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh which i'd like you to clarify i
 
01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
understand your point
 
01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the original bill that came
 
01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:08.149 align:start position:0%
relative to the original bill that came
over

01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
um i understand it relative to some of
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
the comments from the sponsor
 
01:58:16.070 --> 01:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
but certainly my intention in making
 
01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:16.470 align:start position:0%
but certainly my intention in making
that

01:58:16.470 --> 01:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:18.589 --> 01:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
amendment was to remove that
 
01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
constitutionality issue
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
if if it is indeed that and fix it um
 
01:58:27.830 --> 01:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
well guys i i have an answer and
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
actually uh representative
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
i would refer you also back to something
 
01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
that you closed out your remarks with
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
when you said
 
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
um we want to why why should we make any
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
sort of decision before we see
 
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
what the federal minimum wage ends up
 
01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:45.030 align:start position:0%
what the federal minimum wage ends up
being

01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
like this between this um
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
the hr1 um bill that went before
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
election law the other day uh there was
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
another one that went before criminal
 
01:58:55.679 --> 01:58:56.470 align:start position:0%
another one that went before criminal
justice

01:58:56.470 --> 01:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
justice
 
01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
um there's another one that i'm getting
 
01:58:59.669 --> 01:58:59.679 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head it just it just
 
01:59:00.870 --> 01:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
seems like there are so many
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
preemption bills um that
 
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
really play with the concept of
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
federalism and nullification
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh and again not by your interpretation
 
01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
of removing the 45
 
01:59:13.109 --> 01:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
i understand what you're saying on that
 
01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
and i would agree with representative
 
01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
infantine that that makes
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
it a little easier i'm referring to the
 
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
way the bill was characterized when it
 
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
came to us
 
01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
which is if the minimum wage goes up
 
01:59:26.229 --> 01:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
we are going to have our own special
 
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
little thing that
 
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
flies in the face of the supremacy
 
01:59:31.589 --> 01:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
clause and crossed our fingers that it
 
01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
works because it will destroy the
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
restaurant industry otherwise
 
01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:36.639 align:start position:0%
that's that's that sort of nullification
 
01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
concept that i'm feeling in some of
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:42.390 --> 01:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
i don't want to debate but if you want
 
01:59:49.189 --> 01:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
this is no longer uh a senator's bill
 
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
what he thought it did or what he wrote
 
01:59:58.629 --> 01:59:58.639 align:start position:0%
if that language isn't here that's not
 
02:00:00.070 --> 02:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
his bill anymore and
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
just to refer to my language as amended
 
02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
it says that the base rate which is what
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
we call our typically
 
02:00:11.189 --> 02:00:11.199 align:start position:0%
will not be less than the minimum direct
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
wage as
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
set forth in federal minimum wage law uh
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
minimum direct wage is what they call
 
02:00:20.709 --> 02:00:20.719 align:start position:0%
their version of that same number so i
 
02:00:23.830 --> 02:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
i wanted to very clearly say
 
02:00:26.070 --> 02:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
federal law preempts us and we're going
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
to adopt that as state policy
 
02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
if i'm contradicting someone else on
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
some other language
 
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
respectfully i ask that we consider the
 
02:00:39.430 --> 02:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
language that's before us
 
02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
and not what someone else thinks should
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
be done
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
yes um and i agree i understand
 
02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
if we are making the language in so that
 
02:00:57.669 --> 02:00:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh it catches up to the federal minimum
 
02:00:59.910 --> 02:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
wage anyways then why even have the bill
 
02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
because it's the same thing if the
 
02:01:05.910 --> 02:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
tips i i also want to clarify that like
 
02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
i wish i had the confidence that some
 
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
members do that the minimum wage is
 
02:01:10.470 --> 02:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
going to go up
 
02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
um i've been incredibly disappointed
 
02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:13.669 align:start position:0%
um i've been incredibly disappointed
with

02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:01:16.629 --> 02:01:16.639 align:start position:0%
some of the ways that certain senators
 
02:01:16.639 --> 02:01:17.270 align:start position:0%
some of the ways that certain senators
um

02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
in dc have handled that bill um
 
02:01:23.990 --> 02:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
i it just just feels like so much um
 
02:01:25.830 --> 02:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
to insert in the rsa for something that
 
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
basically spells out
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
um that the minimum wage would just be
 
02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
whatever the federal minimum wage is
 
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
anyways it just
 
02:01:33.669 --> 02:01:33.679 align:start position:0%
feels like the language might not need
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
to be there so i appreciate the
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
amendment i understand the language
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
still disagree any comments i'm looking
 
02:01:42.550 --> 02:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
for hands
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:48.840 --> 02:02:03.189 align:start position:0%
 
online

02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:04.629 --> 02:02:04.639 align:start position:0%
i don't think i don't see it but
 
02:02:13.270 --> 02:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:19.510 --> 02:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
no no
 
02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
we have like a the white hand is the
 
02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:27.430 align:start position:0%
we have like a the white hand is the
cursor

02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
cursor
 
02:02:30.550 --> 02:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
by your your face accent any comments
 
02:02:32.070 --> 02:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
here in the lobby
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
speaker the chairman has a couple of
 
02:02:36.390 --> 02:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
comments but any comments here
 
02:02:41.109 --> 02:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
as a laborer in the hot sun
 
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
all through high school and college
 
02:02:49.350 --> 02:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
building stone walls playing sod
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
i was a burger king assistant manager
 
02:02:55.589 --> 02:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
um while i had a job as a trainee as an
 
02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
insurance as an insurance company
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
so i've done some of these jobs and
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
um never never never really been a
 
02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:03.679 align:start position:0%
tipped employee
 
02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
but i know what it's like to to work and
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
want to see that minimum wage increase i
 
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
personally get this get this on camera
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
all your people
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
and give you a second but you want to
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
take this i personally believe the
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
minimum wage should be increased
 
02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
for both tipped and non-tipped because
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sick and tired of hearing the
 
02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:23.189 align:start position:0%
i'm sick and tired of hearing the
argument

02:03:23.189 --> 02:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
argument
 
02:03:26.830 --> 02:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
we're paying people in excess of that
 
02:03:29.830 --> 02:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
now one of my i'm going to use my
 
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
daughters again
 
02:03:32.790 --> 02:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
one of my daughters came home that's
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
been working at old navy
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
ten dollars an hour folding clothes and
 
02:03:38.470 --> 02:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
doing whatever she had uh
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
job seeking had three or four offers in
 
02:03:42.550 --> 02:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
in the same day
 
02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
she now makes uh in excess of 12 an hour
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
as a hostess at a restaurant
 
02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
and she can garner tips for the takeout
 
02:03:54.149 --> 02:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
my other daughter has worked at a
 
02:03:55.589 --> 02:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
restaurant for the last five or six
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
years through her high school and now in
 
02:03:59.109 --> 02:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
her college career
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
she makes 7.75
 
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
plus tips there are other companies out
 
02:04:07.750 --> 02:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
there that have said i don't care about
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
the 327
 
02:04:10.550 --> 02:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
an hour for tips i'm gonna pay you four
 
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
dollars or five dollars an hour
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
plus your tips this is a minimum it
 
02:04:19.030 --> 02:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't preclude someone for doing more
 
02:04:22.390 --> 02:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
it allows employers to hire good people
 
02:04:25.510 --> 02:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
and get a and pay them better
 
02:04:27.270 --> 02:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm all for that that's why i
 
02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
want to increase i'd increase it to four
 
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
dollars for tips and ten dollars
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
right off the bat because that's what
 
02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
people are making right now and it takes
 
02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679 align:start position:0%
away this argument that people aren't
 
02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
making that
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
and i don't like the argument um
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
the phrase that everyone talks about it
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
was a very poor choice of words
 
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
by this the the speaker
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
what he meant by that is it freezes at
 
02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:53.270 align:start position:0%
what he meant by that is it freezes at
327

02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
327
 
02:04:55.109 --> 02:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
instead of bringing it down to the
 
02:04:57.270 --> 02:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
federal 219 or whatever it is
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
that was what i think everyone could
 
02:05:00.550 --> 02:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
probably agree was meant
 
02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
it was not meant to say it doesn't
 
02:05:03.669 --> 02:05:03.679 align:start position:0%
matter if we increase it the feds
 
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
increase it or whatever
 
02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
or if the event decreases let's say to
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
three dollars let's say this thing gets
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
passed down in
 
02:05:11.830 --> 02:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
dc it's ten dollars an hour and maybe
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
three dollars
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
they increase the tip wage ours would
 
02:05:15.669 --> 02:05:15.679 align:start position:0%
have to go back to three no we're
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
keeping it at 327.
 
02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
i wish you had said four would have made
 
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
it easier
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
um i would have liked to have seen that
 
02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:25.350 align:start position:0%
um i would have liked to have seen that
um

02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:33.669 --> 02:05:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
but this helps this bill passes it helps
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
increase the minimum wage
 
02:05:42.149 --> 02:05:42.159 align:start position:0%
because you no longer have the tipped
 
02:05:42.159 --> 02:05:43.510 align:start position:0%
because you no longer have the tipped
wage

02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
wage
 
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
lobby coming here and saying we can't
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
afford it we can't afford it they're
 
02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:47.990 align:start position:0%
afford it we can't afford it they're
already

02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:05:49.589 --> 02:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
making x amount of tips and they're
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
doing this anyway
 
02:05:54.550 --> 02:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
um which is surprised by republican
 
02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
you know it's just like dichotomy you
 
02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
talked about what you call the venn
 
02:05:57.840 --> 02:05:59.109 align:start position:0%
talked about what you call the venn
diagram

02:05:59.109 --> 02:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
diagram
 
02:06:02.550 --> 02:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
of something earlier um it makes it
 
02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:03.910 align:start position:0%
of something earlier um it makes it
easier

02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
easier
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh these folks feel that in the tip
 
02:06:08.629 --> 02:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
industry that as prices go up
 
02:06:10.149 --> 02:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
the percentage of the tip goes up so you
 
02:06:12.149 --> 02:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
pay ten dollars for this and you
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
20 tip that's two dollars you know you
 
02:06:15.910 --> 02:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
pay 15 it's
 
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
three dollars whatever it goes up uh
 
02:06:20.069 --> 02:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
that they're getting that anyway with
 
02:06:23.350 --> 02:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
pure inflation and um and then the
 
02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
increasing cost
 
02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
so they're getting a higher tip anyway
 
02:06:31.669 --> 02:06:31.679 align:start position:0%
this totally removes that argument
 
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
for increasing the minimum wage that's
 
02:06:36.149 --> 02:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
the focus would i like to increase the
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
02:06:40.550 --> 02:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
say it again get your cameras ready
 
02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
i'm one of the republicans that wants to
 
02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
increase the minimum wage number one i
 
02:06:46.950 --> 02:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
think it's a joke
 
02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
that we're paying people not eight
 
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
not eight fifty not nine
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
not even ten dollars an hour to do the
 
02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
most menial tasks
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
we're paying more than that and we can't
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
get employees and they're
 
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
hiring people for more and bonuses and
 
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
cell phones
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
amazon mcdonald's when do
 
02:07:16.149 --> 02:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
what's yours denny's
 
02:07:20.550 --> 02:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh amazon have all decided to increase
 
02:07:23.589 --> 02:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
to a minimum 10 10 12 an hour they're
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
all agreeing to this
 
02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
now not every single job for every
 
02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:28.950 align:start position:0%
now not every single job for every
single

02:07:28.950 --> 02:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
single
 
02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
employer is going to be that way but a
 
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
significant majority and there are jobs
 
02:07:35.910 --> 02:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
to be had
 
02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
hey you want to make it harder to
 
02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
increase the minimum wage don't vote for
 
02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:43.830 align:start position:0%
increase the minimum wage don't vote for
this

02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
um but uh this is coming from a i guess
 
02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
not a conservative enough republican
 
02:08:06.149 --> 02:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
if i may at this late hour
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
um i guess i'm
 
02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
kind of in the same boat with
 
02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:17.830 align:start position:0%
kind of in the same boat with
representation

02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
