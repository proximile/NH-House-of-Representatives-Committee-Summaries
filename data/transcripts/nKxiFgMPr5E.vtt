00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
we're all in agreement we don't have to
 
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
do a roll call on this as a
 
00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
as a subcommittee so could buy a show of
 
00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
hands everyone that's in favor of this
 
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 align:start position:0%

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
amendment passes
 
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 align:start position:0%

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 align:start position:0%
committee on house bill 1186 with
 
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.270 align:start position:0%
 
h

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
h
 
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
do i have a second
 
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
rep bixby seconds and again we'll do a
 
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
show of hands all in favor
 
00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 align:start position:0%
any opposed
 
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
so let the record show that it was a
 
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote by the show of hands
 
00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
that was nice and easy and that's all we
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
have to do is a subcommittee on this so
 
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
it will move to the full committee at 11
 
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.870 align:start position:0%
it will move to the full committee at 11
o'clock

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
so with that i will adjourn the
 
00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and the next subcommittee
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
seeing that it is uh 10
 
00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:01.750 align:start position:0%

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.870 align:start position:0%

i have drafted an amendment based on the
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
collective work that the subcommittee
 
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
had been doing with regard to
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
time of travel concept
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to ask
 
00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:36.389 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to ask
representative

00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:38.550 align:start position:0%

bixby
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
to briefly sort of talk about
 
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.150 align:start position:0%
to briefly sort of talk about
the

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
stylistic outline of
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
what wyatt looks a little bit different
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
in format
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.590 align:start position:0%
okay so um
the

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
uh representative murray submitted this
 
00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:54.389 align:start position:0%
uh representative murray submitted this
to

00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
ols and
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
they had some con
 
00:15:58.399 --> 00:15:59.269 align:start position:0%
they had some con
they

00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
had some concerns about the formatting
 
00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:03.189 align:start position:0%
had some concerns about the formatting
um

00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
so the first thing they said was that uh
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
the statement the
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
statement of purpose is something that
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh is part of the bill but it does not
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
end up in statute
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
it ends up in the record of the um
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
of how the bill has been processed
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
so they said the the this that would
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
have to be uh a separate paragraph at
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
the beginning
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh and it the statement of purpose is
 
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.710 align:start position:0%
uh and it the statement of purpose is
essentially

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh exactly the same as uh well
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
the it is essentially the same as what
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
we had um
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
instead of saying whereas it says
 
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
statement of purpose um and then
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
uh it says
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
the protection of perennial rivers lakes
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
and coastal waters from contamination is
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
in the public interest of the state of
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.189 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
therefore

00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
uh the setback and then
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
everything beyond that is
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
uh the same as we had in
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
the working draft that we
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
were looking at last week
 
00:17:05.439 --> 00:17:06.309 align:start position:0%
were looking at last week
the

00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.909 align:start position:0%
the
uh

00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
the other thing that they
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh said that they were concerned with
 
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.510 align:start position:0%
uh said that they were concerned with
was

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
that uh the
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
um sequence of how the calculation is
 
00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.270 align:start position:0%
um sequence of how the calculation is
done

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
and how the requirements are
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh or
 
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.630 align:start position:0%
uh or
um

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
or prohibitions are set up
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh needed to be done differently than
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
what we said in in order to
 
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that the
 
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:35.990 align:start position:0%
make sure that the
um

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.350 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.789 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
the calculation was
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh clearer for someone who'd be reading
 
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
it so
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh the the changes that
 
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.710 align:start position:0%
uh the the changes that
uh

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
um that i've made he that i made here
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
are basically in order to
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that the calculation is done
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
correctly so uh
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
the term cites the uh in the first two
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
the first two lines are
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
very similar to what we had in the first
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
two lines of the first of the second
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph that we were working on
 
00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.430 align:start position:0%
paragraph that we were working on
uh

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
and the only difference was i moved the
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
word site specific from the calculation
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
paragraph we had which was the third
 
00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:19.909 align:start position:0%
paragraph we had which was the third
paragraph

00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
to the second paragraph
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
also it's the department show shall
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
establish a site
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
site specific setback distance
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
for any
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
proposed new landfill for from any
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
perennial river lake or coastal water of
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire as defined
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
etc uh the setback distance shall be
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
sufficient to prevent any contaminated
 
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.990 align:start position:0%
sufficient to prevent any contaminated
groundwater

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
groundwater
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
at any part of the actual solid waste
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
disposal area from reaching
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
any perennial river lake or coastal
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
water of new hampshire within five years
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
that is essentially
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
exactly what we had in the um
 
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
previous version
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
for the calculation the setback distance
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
shall be calculated as followed
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
the applicant shall hire an independent
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist at the applicant's
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
expense to estimate based on adequate
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
and representative
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
on-site field testing okay so that is
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
basically the same as what we had before
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh the seepage velocity of groundwater
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
in both overburden and
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
over burden slash till and better and in
 
00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:21.830 align:start position:0%
over burden slash till and better and in
bedrock

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
bedrock
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh i removed the word maximum from that
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
sentence uh
 
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.590 align:start position:0%
sentence uh
because

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
what's the way this is going to work
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
when someone's actually on site is
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
they will determine based on the um
 
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.190 align:start position:0%
they will determine based on the um
the

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
basic geology of the area and on the
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
size of the site
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
what would constitute an adequate and
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative sample and it might be if
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
if it's a very small site it could be
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
one test well it could be a test well
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
that tests both at on the overburden
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
until in one location
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh more likely if you're looking at say
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
a 20 to
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
20 acre
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
site for a landfill
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
then it would probably be
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
a half a dozen or so
 
00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.510 align:start position:0%
a half a dozen or so
and

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.390 align:start position:0%
and
the

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
um so the maximum seepage velocity would
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
be the highest reading from any of those
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
test wells they did on the actual
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
and then there's that maximum seepage
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
velocity is what gets used to figure out
 
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.510 align:start position:0%
velocity is what gets used to figure out
uh

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
where that five the five-year distance
 
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
of travel estimate is so
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
what really matters is coming up with a
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
distance so
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
the five year distance of travel
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
estimate is calculated by multiplying
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh the max maximum seepage velocity by
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
five so
 
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.190 align:start position:0%
five so
the

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
seepage velocity is in uh
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
feet per year you multiply that by five
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
you get what you the the distance for
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
five years
 
00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.669 align:start position:0%
five years
um

00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
and the setback uh from any perennial
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
river lake or coastal water of new
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire shall be the greater of the
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
five-year distance of travel estimate
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
calculated in pair sub-paragraph two or
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
two hundred feet
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh so that actually make that actually
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
makes the uh calculation a bit clearer
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
than what we had
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
in the um
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
the draft text we were looking at last
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
week and then uh the
 
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.390 align:start position:0%
week and then uh the
um

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph b has the clarifi the um
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
statement of
 
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
what would prevent a permit from being
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
issued which is no permit shall be
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
issued uh if
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
the new landfill site fails to conform
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
from that with that setback distance as
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
calculated in paragraph a
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of making sure that
 
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
all existing landfills are held harmless
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph c says
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
nothing in this paragraph shall be
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
construed to prohibit the expansion of
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
any landfills that are in operation at
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
the time that this paragraph takes
 
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.549 align:start position:0%
the time that this paragraph takes
effect

00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
so that's uh that is the
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh the way
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
that the text has changed and
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
how essentially the the change text
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
really represents what we were feeling
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
pretty good about last week
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative bixby i will
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
also note in an effort to save paper the
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
amended analysis is on the back so just
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
go ahead and take a look at that
 
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
and i'll open the florida representative
 
00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.350 align:start position:0%
and i'll open the florida representative
class

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
class
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative bixby um it is my
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
understanding that there are
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
applications already pending that people
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
have been going through the process of
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
site development for landfills in the
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire it sounds like
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
you're changing with this bill it would

um
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
i i believe that would be correct but i
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if that i don't know what the
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
grandfathering the details of

that um
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
changing legislation or rules in the
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
course of an application or anyone doing
 
00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%
business in the state
 
00:23:18.799 --> 00:23:20.470 align:start position:0%
business in the state
um

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
you know especially where the process
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
for getting a permit
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
has been cited to us could take up to 10
 
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.630 align:start position:0%
has been cited to us could take up to 10
years

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.350 align:start position:0%
years
is

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
truly um unfair to
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
any proposed business or person
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
in the state that does business with new
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire what kind of message are we
 
00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:44.950 align:start position:0%
hampshire what kind of message are we
sending

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
liv stapleton
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i'm looking at
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
at uh line three in the amendment
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh relative to the question that was
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
just asked uh it says no permit shall be
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
issued by any division of the department
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
for the sighting
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
of a new landfill
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
if any part of the actual solid waste
 
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
disposal area
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
is proposed to be located sufficiently
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
close to any perennial river lake
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
coastal water of new hampshire etc
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
so it would seem to me by the by that
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
wording that that would have an effect
 
00:24:29.919 --> 00:24:31.190 align:start position:0%
wording that that would have an effect
on

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
any current application that's
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
now before the des
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
i mean that's the way i read it
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
and i just thought i'd make mention of
 
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:41.990 align:start position:0%
and i just thought i'd make mention of
that

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
to answer that question how would it
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
affect existing permits and i think it
 
00:24:45.919 --> 00:24:47.990 align:start position:0%
affect existing permits and i think it
does

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your thoughts um
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative com12 yeah also on line
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
11 it says for any proposed new landfill
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
which to me would be someone a new
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
applicant not an application process but
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
if you go down further to line 25 it
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
says the no permit shall be issued for
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
citing a new landfill so
 
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.029 align:start position:0%
citing a new landfill so
um

00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's ambiguous right now and i i don't
 
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:16.789 align:start position:0%
it's ambiguous right now and i i don't
think

00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh there should be a clause in here that
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
for any existing applicants with the des
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%

uh thank you madam chair just to address
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
the concern about there's an existing
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
project on the books that that this may
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
be interfering with that's really a job
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
for the courts to figure out as far as
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
how it would be grandfathered but also
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
our job is to set public policy we just
 
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.590 align:start position:0%
our job is to set public policy we just
can't

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
um not set good public policy whenever
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's a proposed project that
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
someone's working on anywhere in the
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
state we could never do anything as a
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
legislature if we
 
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.669 align:start position:0%
legislature if we
always

00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
always
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
just allowed
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
conduct that was happening to prevent us
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll just remind folks that um
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
to keep a level of of decorum and
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
issuing questions through the chair
 
00:26:15.919 --> 00:26:18.789 align:start position:0%
issuing questions through the chair
please

00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%

bolden

00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
bolden
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
but usually when we are passing policy
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
we do usually have in some type of
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
clause or when there was another
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
policy that came through us
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
you know that where it says
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
except for anything prior to this or
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
that so um
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
usually when we are passing policy we
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're doing good
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
practice and we're not and i understand
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
that we are talking about groundwater in
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
the in the um the health of our state
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
um with this legislation and it's
 
00:26:54.799 --> 00:26:57.350 align:start position:0%
um with this legislation and it's
important

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair i would just add
 
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
that the uh the project that i believe
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
is being alluded to
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh the the applicant doesn't even own
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
the property
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure how far along that
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
process is but but they don't even own
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%

very nice work on the amendment
 
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.710 align:start position:0%
very nice work on the amendment
um

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
i know that was a tough job
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
clearing up language and you did on
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
several pieces
 
00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:18.870 align:start position:0%
several pieces
um

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
while i support the amendment
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
i'm unable to support the otpa
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
on the bill and and here's why it's
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
great it's a good bill and um i really
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
am a subscriber to
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
the time and travel setback
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
um i think several other states are
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
doing that with some success
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
maine even has a larger time component
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
of six years instead of five
 
00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:48.549 align:start position:0%
of six years instead of five
but

00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
i was reading over the weekend all of
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
and i came into a stumbling block
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
that was pointed out by the testimony by
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
the hydraulist hydrologist there
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
who wrote the testimony
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
timothy white
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
and he supported
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
the formulation
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
made sense
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
but he said there's three problems with
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
and i'm only going to go into one of the
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
problems because i'm not sure about the
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
other two but representative i just also
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
we are talking about the bill now as
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
amended so as amended
 
00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:34.070 align:start position:0%
amended so as amended
exactly

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh and he goes on requiring the
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
immediate shutdown of a landfill if a
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
priority pollutant is detected in any
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
concentration baseline and why is that a
 
00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.990 align:start position:0%
concentration baseline and why is that a
problem

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
because immediate shutdown has
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
a harmful and immediate impact
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
in the economy and the operation of
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
waste collection and disposal
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
and if you're shut down and the shutdown
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
could be extensive for
 
00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:05.110 align:start position:0%
could be extensive for
weeks

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
months maybe even a year and maybe some
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
pollutant that may have been found may
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
not be from the landfill
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
and all these maybes should not be
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
an arbitrary determination to shut the
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
landfill down madam chair point of order
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
state your point of order i i believe we
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
were supposed to be confining our

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
just for the benefit of everyone here
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to just do a quick caucus
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
here i'll try to get back in for 11
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
o'clock but we might be a couple of
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
we will open the full committee
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
1186 there it is there we go on house
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
bill 1186
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
we have two bills to take up today in
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
1186 and 1454 we're going to do 1186
 
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.710 align:start position:0%
1186 and 1454 we're going to do 1186
first

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
so the subcommittee on anal animal
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
protection convened and wants to bring
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
forward a recommendation of otpa on
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
to the full committee on house bill 1186
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
you should have a copy of that amendment
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
if not there are some on the table and
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
does do the committee members all have a
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have all right i'll give you
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
just a second to grab when they're on
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay so what this amendment does is
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
it fixes a couple of points that we
 
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
discussed in the subcommittee that where
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
we found some errors in the bill and if
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
everybody's had a chance to read it
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
the overall concept of what we were
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
looking to do was
 
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
to make it so that
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
when folks had a mandatory evacuation
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
that they could
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
have the ability to have their companion
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
animals cared for as well because that
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
was expressed as a concern and it would
 
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
have some folks that would not
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
evacuate and so we
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
through testimony in the original bill
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
and in the subcommittee we learned that
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
there were a few uh critical errors that
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
we felt in the original language
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
and i believe we've cleaned them up in
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh in this amendment in the
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
work of the subcommittee
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
this will allow that when in a vacuum
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
emergency evacuation order goes into
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
place any hotel or community shelter
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
that shelters evacuated persons shall
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
allow for disaster animal response
 
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
trailers or other reasonable
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
accommodations on site to accommodate
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
any companion animal belonging to that
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
evacuated person
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
that was one major piece that was
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
important because originally the bill
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
would have
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
forced the animals to be kept in the
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
confines of the hotel itself with if
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
that if it was a hotel or a community
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
center and we saw a whole lot of
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
problems perhaps having some
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
non-compatible companion animals sharing
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
a common space
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
and so by
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
doing this amendment we learned that
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
there were
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
shelter trailers available
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
that would be made available during an
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
emergency evacuation and they already
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
exist within the state so
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
that was one of the things that we
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure was that they had a
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
place to deploy those trailers that was
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
on sort of the same campus as where the
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
evacuated person ended up so that they
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
were there in the same area with their
 
00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.549 align:start position:0%
were there in the same area with their
animals

00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
animals
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
the second portion of this it provides
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
any volunteer who has been vetted by the
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
and is a member of that disaster animal
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
response team
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
and assist you in assisting the
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
evacuated persons she'll be considered
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
an emergency worker under rsa 21p41
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
in essence what it does is extends
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
workers comp to
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
protection it's not exactly workers comp
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
but the same provisions of workers comp
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
so that if this person who is aiding and
 
00:50:43.359 --> 00:50:44.470 align:start position:0%
so that if this person who is aiding and
assisting

00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
assisting
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
in this response team is injured during
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
that practice then they
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
have some protection
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't fall back onto their
 
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
personal medical insurance
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of in a nutshell what
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%

and uh it is
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh one of the other uh changes in this
 
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
amendment allows for other reasonable
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
accommodations and that would make it
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
possible for uh

yes chair thank you for taking my
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
question in the language where it says
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
obviously shall allow
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
does that leave it up to each facility
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
then to make its own decision on whether
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
it can or can't
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
take pets i just want to make sure i
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
understand the shell part
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
no so the the shell part requires them
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
to provide a location to put these
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
trailers someplace on campus or or some
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
other type of accommodation as bixby was
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
referring to but they would not be
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
required to put them in the building
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh the motion about to pass is amended
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1186 moves forward without
 
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
objection we'll put it on the consent
 
00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:55.990 align:start position:0%
objection we'll put it on the consent
calendar

00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
in the chair we'll do the majority
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
report on
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 1186
 
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
as soon as the clerk is ready we will
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
you're all set all right so we'll come
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
back out of executive session and go
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
into a regular session on
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
i will uh call on rep murray who led the
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
solid waste committee to
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
give us an explanation of the work that
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee did and the
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation that they provide
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um yes so i the
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
committee definitely did a lot of work
 
00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:57.910 align:start position:0%
committee definitely did a lot of work
to

00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
seek further clarity in
 
00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.309 align:start position:0%
seek further clarity in
um

00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
the groundwater contamination we sought
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
to address the the topic of leak spill
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
or other failures we also then sought to
 
00:58:12.079 --> 00:58:13.990 align:start position:0%
or other failures we also then sought to
address

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
perennial rivers lakes and other coastal
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
waters i know that that was important to
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
some members of the subcommittee and all
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
of our
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
work that we did together on that
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
the time of travel concept that we felt
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
was incredibly important we are seeing
 
00:58:30.319 --> 00:58:31.589 align:start position:0%
was incredibly important we are seeing
regionally

00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
regionally
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
um and across the nation
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
other um
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
states adopting this as part of their
 
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
method in their landfill citing criteria
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
and the committee did recommend that it
 
00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
oh sorry pixby i can't see you over
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
there yeah go ahead so i just want to um
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
give a little uh run through of how the
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
how this bill is amended works um so uh
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
one thing that i think is important to
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
mention is that
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
uh there had been uh in the initial uh
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
and hearing on the initial bill there
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
had been um
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of concern about
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
the way that the third section of that
 
00:59:22.799 --> 00:59:24.309 align:start position:0%
the way that the third section of that
bill

00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
addressed the consequences of a spill
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
that has been removed entirely from this
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
bill so uh there is um
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
there this bill is only
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
a change to one number
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
that is in current um
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh current regulations and that number
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
is how far
 
00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:47.589 align:start position:0%
is how far
a

00:59:47.589 --> 00:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh landfill
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
has to be how far away a landfill has to
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
be from a
 
00:59:53.599 --> 00:59:54.630 align:start position:0%
be from a
um

00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
a river a perennial river lake or
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
coastal water as defined in state
 
00:59:59.599 --> 01:00:00.710 align:start position:0%
coastal water as defined in state
statute

01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.230 align:start position:0%
statute
and

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh the current dis that current distance
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
is an arbitrary number of 200 feet
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh and what we have done is change that
 
01:00:10.319 --> 01:00:11.750 align:start position:0%
uh and what we have done is change that
to

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
a minimum of 200 feet but
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
a but the key number is
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
the number is
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
that distance is calculated by looking
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
at how fast the groundwater moves in the
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
particular area that someone is
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
proposing that a landfill might be
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
placed and
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
the ability to make
 
01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.069 align:start position:0%
the ability to make
measurements

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
measurements
 
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
of groundwater movement is
 
01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh something that science
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologists have been able to do for
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
at least 100 years it is a
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
well-established uh science
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh the uh
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
you can't uh some
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
the only
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
unpredictability in there is that you
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
can't predict exactly how something is
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
going to be exactly what the rocks are
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
going to be and soil is going to be like
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
over a long very long distance
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
but you can get a really good estimate
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
of how fast uh
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
groundwater travels
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
and the reason that groundwater
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
traveling is matters is that
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
groundwater is what would convey a spill
 
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
or leak to a sensitive water body like a
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
perennial river or lake
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
the idea is and we've laid that in that
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
out in the state and state and out of
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
purpose is that you want to make any
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
landfill far enough away from a lake or
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
river or coastal water
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
that if there is a problem
 
01:01:47.359 --> 01:01:48.230 align:start position:0%
that if there is a problem
then

01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
there is time to deal with it
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
so uh we have
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
consulting with various experts five
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
years is a reasonable amount of time to
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
recognize that there is a problem
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
and map the problem and then
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
figure out what to do about it it may
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
take longer than five years to actually
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
complete the the remediation uh in fact
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes the re remediation may have to
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
be a forever ongoing process
 
01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:17.670 align:start position:0%
be a forever ongoing process
but

01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
with by
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
noticing it within that five year period
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
prevent it from getting to that water
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
body and that is that is the goal of
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
this bill preventing contempt potential
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
contamination from getting to a
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
sensitive water body
 
01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.630 align:start position:0%
sensitive water body
and

01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.230 align:start position:0%
and
so

01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
what the bill does the
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph two of the bill so paragraph
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
two of the bill basically lays out
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
how that calculation is made using
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
uh the maximum seepage rate which is
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
the result of doing on-site tests
 
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:01.039 align:start position:0%
the tests are always on the site of the
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
proposed water a landfill there they
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
don't go on to
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
any property around it
 
01:03:07.039 --> 01:03:08.150 align:start position:0%
any property around it
and

01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
then an estimate is made from those the
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
maximum seepage estimate from the
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
various test wells that are on that
 
01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.870 align:start position:0%
various test wells that are on that
proposed

01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:17.750 align:start position:0%
proposed
site

01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
site
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
is what is used to calculate
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh how far away it need the
 
01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.150 align:start position:0%
uh how far away it need the
um

01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
it would have to be or how far away
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
any water body would be to be safe in
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
that five year period
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
so um it's basically using a combination
 
01:03:33.839 --> 01:03:34.710 align:start position:0%
so um it's basically using a combination
of

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
well-known hydrogeology and
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
fairly simple
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
algebra to determine what
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
the uh what what an appropriate distance
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
is for a setback
 
01:03:47.599 --> 01:03:48.390 align:start position:0%
is for a setback
and

01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
in some cases uh if it is on bedrock uh
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
solid bedrock and um play
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:03:56.319 --> 01:03:57.510 align:start position:0%
that that
um

01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
that distance may be the calculated
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
distance may be less than the 200 feet
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
but 200 feet seems like
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
that's been working for a while for as
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
as a minimum
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh so it seems like
 
01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.109 align:start position:0%
uh so it seems like
uh

01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
using that 200 feet or
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
a calculated distance so if it's in a
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
sandy area
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
that the travel time might be much
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
faster and
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
contaminants could potentially travel
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
five miles within five years and that uh
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
that was so that would be um
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
probably a site that it
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
less appropriate for a landfill so
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
but the
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
one of the key things about this is that
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
this is the test that is done very early
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
in the process so that
 
01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:48.630 align:start position:0%
in the process so that
a

01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
someone who's looking to cite a landfill
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
can determine before putting a lot of
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
money into it
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not that that uh proposed
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
site makes sense and if
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
the hydrogeology says no it doesn't make
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
sense then they don't spend a lot of
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
money trying to
 
01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:05.990 align:start position:0%
money trying to
uh

01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
to cite a landfill where it doesn't make
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
sense so this is basically a way of
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
protecting the investment of someone who
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
would want to make
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
i i commend the
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
study committee on the work that they
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
did i i think you've done a great job in
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
cleaning up a lot of the concerns that
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
were were raised in the original
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
language of the bill and
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
the the amendment
 
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
reflects uh a great level of detail and
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
commitment on the part of the study
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
committee so i want to
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
again commend them for the work that
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
they did here
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
now the narrow focus of the study
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
committee obviously was strictly on the
 
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
language of this particular bill
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
i guess one of the
 
01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
concerns and reservations that
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
i have about passing the bill as a whole
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
is is more about the work we did on
 
01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
house bill 1049 the study committee bill
 
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
we included
 
01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.230 align:start position:0%
we included
the

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.670 align:start position:0%
the
the

01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
purpose of house bill 1454 as well as
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
many others within that study committee
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
and i think it makes it a pretty
 
01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
charges that committee with really
 
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
looking at the complete landfill citing
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
criteria rules as it pertains to all
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
aspects other than just this
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
the narrow focus of this bill on the
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
200-foot setback
 
01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:30.829 align:start position:0%
200-foot setback
but

01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
um so i
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
my concerns overall
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
are related to
 
01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.230 align:start position:0%
are related to
passing

01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
passing
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
as a standalone bill where i want to
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that the
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
study committee has the ability to do as
 
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
it would
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
is charged to do in looking at that
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
that whole process of of citing a
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
landfill and all of the things that go
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
along with it
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
did the
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
i guess i'll throw this out to the whole
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
committee for a little bit of a
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
discussion here and i'd like some
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
thoughts on
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
on not just this bill as an individual
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
but sort of the whole process as a whole
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
if we're ready to have that conversation
 
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly willing too so anybody
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
else would like to
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
weigh in on on your thoughts on this
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
bill and perhaps the overall picture of
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
the study committee
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative contract thank you mr
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
there's a couple components here first
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
off i think that the amendment
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
was really well done
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
and should be the piece of legit
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
piece of information going forward for
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
any committee
 
01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.430 align:start position:0%
any committee
um

01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
to look at because
 
01:07:45.359 --> 01:07:46.309 align:start position:0%
to look at because
um

01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
we did do a pretty deep dive and the
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
language has been cleaned up from the
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
original bill really well
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
so when we're talking just about the
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
amendment i think that
 
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's a great piece of work
 
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
however i do agree with you that we did
 
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
establish a subcom another committee to
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
study all the criteria for citing
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
landfills and i think that now that
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
we've done our work that this should be
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative abrami yeah
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
just for clarity i just want to
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
understand when you say study committee
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
are we talking about a joint committee
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
with the senate is this in a formal
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
study committee or a study committee of
 
01:08:25.349 --> 01:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
the committee uh this would be a study
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
committee that was established in house
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
bill 1049 that would include a senator
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
right and what and mr what's the uh
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
due date is that november one or is it a
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
year plus number one plus a year i
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
believe it's november one i will have to
 
01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
look to confirm that but i do believe it
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
was november 1. so it's not that far
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
away if it's november one as well
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
and for uh the benefit of those that we
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
have subs on our committee today first
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
off thank you for coming in and subbing
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
we we appreciate yeah you're doing that
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
because i know it takes time out of your
 
01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
day and uh
 
01:09:01.829 --> 01:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
the overall purpose of house bill 1049
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
was to look at
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
the the whole that whole section of uh
 
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
landfill citing criteria this was one
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
piece of it we had multiple bills that
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
we put together that we passed on the
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
house floor last last week of the week
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
for whenever our session date was but
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
representative bolden has some input
 
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i guess i have a
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
question for you about the um the study
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
committee bill that i guess we're
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
talking about um is there any kind of
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
moratorium in that bill because
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
obviously i think the fact that we're
 
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
studying that as a committee or as a
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
legislature indicates that we feel that
 
01:09:37.759 --> 01:09:38.630 align:start position:0%
legislature indicates that we feel that
our

01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
landfill citing criteria is flawed and
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
could be improved to protect the
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
interests of the people of the state of
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and i'm just wondering if
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to undergo that study for
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
another potential year or longer before
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
we can get legislation
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh put into place
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
based on the results of that study are
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
we going to prevent the sighting of new
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
landfills so that
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
our findings in the study in the future
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
kind of honored uh for any new landfills
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
or will people be able to
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
build new landfills while we're busy
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
studying something
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
so my understanding that's a great
 
01:10:18.239 --> 01:10:20.070 align:start position:0%
so my understanding that's a great
question

01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll answer this way that the
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
you know i think our committee certainly
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
made it
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
a high priority to look at the landfill
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
siting criteria whether they're flawed
 
01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
or not i don't know that we came to a
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
conclusion on that but we certainly felt
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
that it was within the purview of this
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
committee to look at the policy and it
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
had been many years since it had been
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
updated and certainly all of the
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
interest in you know in the bills that
 
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
were put in indicated that the
 
01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
legislature at least members of it had a
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
real interest in
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
our solid waste management and the in
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
the sighting of these facilities so
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
you know i think
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
that this committee had bills last year
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
that we felt were
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
were important and the response has been
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
very overwhelming and wonderful from
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and other
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature with the
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
bills that were put in and
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
i think we've um made a good showing as
 
01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
a committee that we feel the solid waste
 
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
policy in new hampshire is really
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
important and we want to take a look at
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
it so to answer that part of it as far
 
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
as a moratorium i don't believe that
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
there's one in place i think that the
 
01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.630 align:start position:0%
there's one in place i think that the
current

01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
rules would
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
would stay in place and they would even
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
if we passed
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
this as a standalone bill it would just
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
change one narrow section as it relates
 
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
to the 200-foot setback that that's my
 
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
understanding i'll certainly open it up
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
to other committee members if they have
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
different opinions
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
all right we've got multiple hands let
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
me go with rep marie first
 
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for taking my
 
01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.310 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for taking my
question

01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
the one question i did have and i i
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't have 1049 in front of me but
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
it does have a repeal clause correct
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
like it goes into effect and then once
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
the study committee is finished it
 
01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.910 align:start position:0%
the study committee is finished it
comes

01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
i do have it here let me read it real
 
01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:17.990 align:start position:0%
i do have it here let me read it real
quick

01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know i do not see a repeal clause in
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
here unless i'm missing it it does um
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
the report out day is november 1.
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
i wasn't sure if it
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
with study committees sometimes we had a
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
statement we intended to put one in i
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
know the conversation was had but i
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
but i do not see the language in here
 
01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
i think that was something that i would
 
01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
recommend representative dixon yeah i
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
think if if we somehow fail to get the
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
repeal clause in there maybe we need to
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
talk it to the senate when it comes over
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
there because i i would concur because i
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
know the intent was to have one in there
 
01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.070 align:start position:0%
know the intent was to have one in there
yes

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative dutsy
 
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
yeah just for clarification uh the bill
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about is hb 1049
 
01:13:01.199 --> 01:13:02.870 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about is hb 1049
correct

01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
well the study committee bill is yes
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
and the elements of house bill 1454 are
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
included in house bill 1049 that's why
 
01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
it's a relevant topic but uh just for
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
clarification we did not put in the epr
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
bill in that correct it uh 1049 is only
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
for the sighting of landfills we didn't
 
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
put in any of the other bills that we
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
talked about going to interim study is
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
that correct yes we did actually i don't
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
have all of the bill numbers that the
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
one you were talking about was the
 
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility yes that
 
01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
language is in there as well
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
okay so basically 1049
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
um is the vehicle that we're going to
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
use where we put in a lot of different
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
bills relating to i mean we had
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
something for the bottle bill that we
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to study the epr that we wanted
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
to study is it my understanding that
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
some of those bills are under the
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
interim study of 1049
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
so they're under interim study with the
 
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
committee correct we we've retained them
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
in the committee so that we can look at
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
them again as we go
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh into the later part of this year's
 
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
session 1049 would establish a study
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
committee that would work on this
 
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
obviously have to go through the whole
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
passage and so it would be over the
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
summer and into the fall and then it
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
would make a recommendation for future
 
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
legislation on
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
several topics and i apologize i don't
 
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
have all of the bill numbers right in
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
front of me i don't believe the bottle
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
recycling bill was part of that i
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
believe we just i asked that
 
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair you're welcome our
 
01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.310 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair you're welcome our
representative

01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
yes chair thank you
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
um first of all i actually like to thank
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
rhett bixby before the work he did on
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
some on the language of the amendment
 
01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.669 align:start position:0%
some on the language of the amendment
uh

01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
appreciated about that standalone was
 
01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
that you greatly clarified the language
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
and you
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
you really just made it simplify to move
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
the ball down further
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
down the line with what you've done with
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
that bill um
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
i one thing i did want to point out is
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
that i i don't believe the des ever
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
testified that their current landfill
 
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.110 align:start position:0%
testified that their current landfill
siting

01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
siting
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
criterion were insufficient this bill
 
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
did not come to us because des said that
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
they needed their errors or their
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
current curriculum for doing this was
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
not up to par
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
and i i do want to say that as a
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
standalone bill i actually
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
like 1454
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
in the but i do have concerns in the big
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
picture as it relates to 1049 and
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
studying trying to look at this as an
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
overall landfill sighting i do have
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
concerns that it may be putting the cart
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
before the horse
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
when it comes to uh passing this today
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative bixby
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd just like to to point out that
 
01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:53.669 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd just like to to point out that
um

01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:53.679 --> 01:15:55.430 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.709 align:start position:0%
the
uh

01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
the uh departments
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
are essentially uh not policy making
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
bodies departments are executive bodies
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
so when we establish a policy in the
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
legislature it is the department that
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
executes that policy
 
01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.390 align:start position:0%
executes that policy
but

01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
unless there is a specific
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
problem that they have in terms of the
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
mechanics of of
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
of execution
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily come to us and
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
say we need to have a policy change
 
01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.750 align:start position:0%
say we need to have a policy change
so

01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
we do as a legislature is we look around
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
the country we look at changing
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
conditions we look uh in terms of the
 
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
way that
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
the uh that things are operating both in
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
our state and in our country and we say
 
01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:49.510 align:start position:0%
our state and in our country and we say
oh

01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
some other states have been having
 
01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:52.390 align:start position:0%
some other states have been having
trouble

01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.470 align:start position:0%
trouble
with

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
contaminants moving to
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
moving from landfills to sensitive
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
bodies of water and they have as a
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
result put into place
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
distances

01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
distances
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
to uh safeguard their water bodies and
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh what we can and
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
recognizing that we can proactively say
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
oh that's a good idea that's a policy
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
that would make sense in new hampshire
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
where we have so many sensitive water
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
bodies that are critical to our tourism
 
01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:27.669 align:start position:0%
bodies that are critical to our tourism
industry

01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
industry
 
01:17:27.679 --> 01:17:29.669 align:start position:0%
industry
uh

01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
um i think that
 
01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.550 align:start position:0%
um i think that
uh

01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that des didn't come to us and
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
say please fix this doesn't mean that we
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be working on that policy
 
01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
rapamola did you ever
 
01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:46.960 align:start position:0%

chair
i

01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying rep bixby
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
would des not have a responsibility if
 
01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:55.830 align:start position:0%
would des not have a responsibility if
they

01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
found something to be flawed or
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
inaccurate inadequate to to bring that
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
to our attention
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
as well i just don't all i my point was
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
well i understand that they are they are
 
01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:07.990 align:start position:0%
well i understand that they are they are
the

01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
the executing body of legislature
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh i'm just saying that this they
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
themselves did not come to us and say
 
01:18:15.199 --> 01:18:15.910 align:start position:0%
themselves did not come to us and say
that

01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
the people who are in charge of citing
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
landfills did not come to us and say
 
01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
that what we have currently is
 
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
inadequate that's all i'm saying
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah and that is correct they
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
did not come to us but um but it it it
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
does but it doesn't mean that we can't
 
01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.709 align:start position:0%
does but it doesn't mean that we can't
observe

01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
observe
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
and uh policies elsewhere and say this
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
makes sense for us
 
01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
thank you rips off keita
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about um the need for
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
a bill like this
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
it did not come from des it came from
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in the northern kingdom
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
and the state of new hampshire has a
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
huge problem with water
 
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
there are cancer clusters all over this
 
01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.470 align:start position:0%
there are cancer clusters all over this
state

01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
and right now
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
we have a blooming cancer cluster in
 
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.189 align:start position:0%
we have a blooming cancer cluster in
merrimack

01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
merrimack
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
what we need to do
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
is we need to listen to our stakeholders
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
and they came to us for remedy and they
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
came for remedy because a private
 
01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:22.229 align:start position:0%
came for remedy because a private
company

01:19:22.229 --> 01:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
company
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
is bringing trash from outside the state
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
as a business practice and they're
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
making money
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
and they they they they're talking about
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
their capacities for their landfills
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
well the stakeholders in the northern
 
01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
kingdom came for remedy from us and
 
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that pay the taxes
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that live with our
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
decisions and we need to give them
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
remedy when we've first heard the first
 
01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.709 align:start position:0%
remedy when we've first heard the first
um

01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
section of this bill several years ago
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
many many many people up in the dalton
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
whitefield bethlehem area up there we
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
got more mail than any other bill that
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
i've seen before this committee
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
and they're asking for remedy
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
those are the people that we need to
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
listen to
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
i you know i can just say i don't really
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
care what des is up to i care about the
 
01:20:27.669 --> 01:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
the citizens who voted for us who pay
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
the taxes and sent us here to to
 
01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.750 align:start position:0%
the taxes and sent us here to to
represent

01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.870 align:start position:0%
represent
their

01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
their needs of their communities and so
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
continually kicking this bill
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
down the road like a can
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
taking the first step in solving a
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
problem so to put it into another study
 
01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:50.229 align:start position:0%
problem so to put it into another study
committee

01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
when we're just allowing private
 
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
companies to bring in trash we have to
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
the whole country the whole country has
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
to look
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
at trash waste management and all of
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
that but why
 
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
do we have to be so concerned about a
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
private company bringing impr trash from
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
out of state and then they talk about
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
our capacity for having more and more
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
and more landfills
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
i don't get it we're a small state with
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
a small population and we should be able
 
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
to manage our landfills with what we
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
have and increase the things like
 
01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
recycling and and the things that we
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
need to do as a state but this the
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
people came for remedy to us
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative many
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
good points and all of those hopefully
 
01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
will you'll bring to the study committee
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
and present them when they're looking at
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
it because they certainly are good
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
points and they're right online with it
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
so i have a multitude of hands i'll go
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
with rep aaron
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to remind the committee
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
of what was passed on hb 1049 this study
 
01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.350 align:start position:0%
of what was passed on hb 1049 this study
bill

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
and the study bill includes
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
that the committee would study the
 
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
citing criteria for new landfills and
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
with a focus on community impact
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
environmental impact and public good
 
01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
it also will be studying solid waste
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
policies in northeastern states that
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
could be adopted
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
adapted to new hampshire
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
we'll be studying the surety bonding of
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
landfills to ensure capacity to pay for
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
potential damages
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
also changing the definition of required
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
setback to landfills from water bodies
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
by establishing
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
standards that use the hydro
 
01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.430 align:start position:0%
standards that use the hydro
hydrological

01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
hydrological
 
01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.470 align:start position:0%
hydrological
characteristics

01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
characteristics
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
so in other words 15
 
01:22:40.719 --> 01:22:42.229 align:start position:0%
so in other words 15
um

01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
14 hb 1454 is already in this
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
and then item number five is the
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
extender producer responsibility piece
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
of it and number six the role of
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
landfills and incineration and
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
preventing disposable wipes they've got
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of things to make a comprehensive
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
waste management package
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
in this study committee and i see
 
01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
this hb 1454
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
as being a very
 
01:23:13.199 --> 01:23:15.990 align:start position:0%
as being a very
important

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
part of this study committee and i think
 
01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:20.550 align:start position:0%
part of this study committee and i think
that

01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
this current bill that we're looking at
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
1049 is an integral piece
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
and that the subcommittee's work on this
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
has really laid the groundwork
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
for that particular
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
definition of required setbacks for
 
01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:35.350 align:start position:0%
definition of required setbacks for
landfills

01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
will be will go a long way to help the
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
study committee with the information
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
that they've
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
it's there
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
and it will be covered the
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
reporting out for that
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
for 10 49 is november 1st so it's not
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
going to take um you know forever or
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
another year
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
but at least
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
what we will have
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
after this study committee is finished
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
is a comprehensive package of
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
legislation that can go in right away in
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
the next time we
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
have our legislature
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
okay representative bolden i know had a
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:20.709 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
the the representative who spoke earlier
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
is absolutely right we know our landfill
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
citing criteria is inadequate and we
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
know this because there are cancer
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
clusters near our existing landfills
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
this is a fact
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
i would support rolling this into a
 
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
study if the study included a moratorium
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
on new landfills however as far as i've
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
heard it doesn't
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
if you want to talk about putting the
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
cart before the horse
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
letting another super landfill be cited
 
01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
while we study the issue is putting the
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
cart before the horse and i will remind
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
the committee the house
 
01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.149 align:start position:0%
the committee the house
passed

01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
the policy that we voted down in this
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
committee last year it is clear to me
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
that the house
 
01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:02.870 align:start position:0%
that the house
supports

01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
supports
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
preventing this landfill from being
 
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
cited this particular landfill at least
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
while we study this issue and make sure
 
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
landfills are only placed
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
i just want to remind the committee
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
before we get way off track here we've
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
already passed 1049 we've already rolled
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
all this criteria into that study
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
committee so what we're looking at is do
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
we want to pass this bill as a
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
standalone bill even though we've
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
already charged
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
the study committee with doing this so
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
just a reminder okay we seem to be
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
deviating just a hair there which is
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
which is fine and certainly looking at
 
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
all of us here can i follow up just
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you and and to that
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
point my argument is that we should pass
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
this bill because i think this is a
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
minimum amount of protection for our
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
citizens in the north country that
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
they've been asking for
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
while we study the larger issue thank
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative uh
 
01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative perez had her hand up for
 
01:25:59.110 --> 01:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
a bit thank you for having to give me
 
01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak up
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
i would love to get the support for this
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
bill we've been working so hard since
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
last year and i believe yes it is a good
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
idea to have a subcommittee but this
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
bill alone i think is what we need and i
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
believe this is what we need
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
areas like milford already struggling
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
with water contamination merrimack
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
already struggled with water
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
contamination how much longer are we
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
going to stop these bills to pass how
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
much longer are we going to put it in
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittees our community is asking us
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing in passing this
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
bill right now
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
i believe it's the right thing to do for
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
us thank you so much
 
01:26:41.590 --> 01:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative safidas
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair the first
 
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
thing i just want to throw out is that
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has the highest rate of
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
bladder cancer in the whole country and
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
the area from merrimack all the way over
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
to the seacoast is a whole band of
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
high bladder cancer
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
when you talk about treatment from
 
01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.070 align:start position:0%
when you talk about treatment from
cancers

01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
cancers
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
early treatment is the best and so
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
it's it seems to me that what we're
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
doing is we are sacrificing people's
 
01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:16.790 align:start position:0%
doing is we are sacrificing people's
health

01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:17.669 align:start position:0%
health
for

01:27:17.669 --> 01:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
a study committee
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is
 
01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
just as an aside
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
people's homes and their private wells
 
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
is their biggest life investment and if
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
your water in your well is polluted you
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
cannot sell your home you no longer have
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
an asset
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
so i just don't see another study
 
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
committee when the people have come to
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
us asking for remedy
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing i would like to say
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
publicly and it's probably not
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate but that's okay
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
i have never been allowed to be honest a
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
from this committee
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
and so i would publicly like to say if
 
01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
this goes to a study committee then i
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
would expect
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
that i would be invited to be on it
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank you well thank you represent
 
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative i just want to remind you
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
what's already gone to a study committee
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
it that that's not what we're voting on
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's already part of the study committee
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
and as far as the placement of the
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
members he'll
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
please make your request known to the
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
speaker's offices they're the ones that
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
will establish who is on it but okay uh
 
01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative bixby i'll go over here
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
next yeah so uh what i'd like to focus
 
01:28:38.550 --> 01:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
on is just sort of getting back to why
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
why it makes sense to do this bill now
 
01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
waiting for
 
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the entire context of 1049
 
01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that i have
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
five years as a five terms as a
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
legislator is trying to
 
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
look at an entire
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
chapter of
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
law and fix it all at once
 
01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:09.830 align:start position:0%
law and fix it all at once
and

01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
it was the worst decision i ever made
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh it was
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
there were many small components of what
 
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
i did which we have now worked through
 
01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:21.270 align:start position:0%
i did which we have now worked through
but

01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
trying to do it all at once
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
in one big bill
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
was a disaster
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
and when you have so
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
my feeling is that when you have a small
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
bill that you have right it doesn't make
 
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
sense to put off passing it
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh and we have this right and i think we
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
should pass it now
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and i i do
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
remember that bill and it was a
 
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
nightmare for you and and certainly the
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh the study committee could recommend
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
several small bills not all in one large
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
one which i think generally is good
 
01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.750 align:start position:0%
one which i think generally is good
practice

01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh rep dot c then i'll go to rep
 
01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.350 align:start position:0%
okay uh rep dot c then i'll go to rep
murray

01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
murray
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um
 
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
the last couple of months i've been
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of time on webinars
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
regarding recycling reducing
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
and reusing
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
yesterday i did a webinar on dirty dirt
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
where a number of companies private
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
companies all of them
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
came together to talk about the problem
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
that they have of waste disposal with
 
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
dirty dirt
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
was an hour and a half they didn't
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
conclude anything except it's still a
 
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
problem but what i see over and over
 
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
again is that
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
every single piece of this huge issue
 
01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
that we have with solid waste management
 
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
every single piece
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
is an enormous project on its own
 
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
whether you're talking about glass
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
recycling you're talking about dirty
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
dirt you're talking about asphalt
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
recycling uh construction and demolition
 
01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.149 align:start position:0%
recycling uh construction and demolition
debris

01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
debris
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
bottle recycling
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
epr i've been working for two years
 
01:30:59.590 --> 01:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
doing research on an extended producer
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility for
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
tire disposal used use tires it's a huge
 
01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:06.550 align:start position:0%
tire disposal used use tires it's a huge
problem

01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
when i had my tires replaced recently i
 
01:31:12.149 --> 01:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
spoke to the owner about this and i said
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
apparently in new hampshire we don't
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
have a problem because every time
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
that i try to talk to somebody about it
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
they tell me we don't have a problem we
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
recycle we reuse these tires and they
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
all go to maine where we use we get a
 
01:31:28.229 --> 01:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
tire derived fuel
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
and he laughed at me and said talk to
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
contractors he said every time they dig
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
up someplace for a new house he said
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
they find a load of tires that have been
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
disposed illegally and in fact on the
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
nashua conservation commission we're
 
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
dealing it with it right now so what i'm
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
saying is is that i think each one of
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
these issues is such a huge problem
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
that to put hb 1454
 
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
into an omnibus
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
interim study bill where you're talking
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
about disposal of wipes which when we
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
talked about that in public hearing we
 
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
recognized it was a a huge issue and it
 
01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
was going to take a lot of work to
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
figure out how to produce a bill that
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
was adequate there when you have
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
epr thrown into that same bill and i
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
recognize how difficult that is to try
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
to piecemeal and come up with some kind
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
of legislation
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
i think we're doing a disservice to this
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
bill hb 1454 if we put it into an
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill like that
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
and i would like to support pulling it
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
out and passing it today thank you
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
so just as a process update
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
we've already put it in house bill 1049
 
01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:43.270 align:start position:0%
we've already put it in house bill 1049
okay

01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
passing this won't pull it out it still
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
would allow
 
01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
the study of it it's what this would do
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
is it would put this language into
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
statute and if the study committee found
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
that there were some problems with it
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
they would then have to change it so
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
that that's what would occur just as as
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
an update okay
 
01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be pulling it out of house
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
bill 1049 to pass this today okay
 
01:33:05.679 --> 01:33:06.790 align:start position:0%
bill 1049 to pass this today okay
uh

01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
boy i got hands all over again i'll go
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
with red bull and i haven't been over
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
there in a while
 
01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair just to
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
clarify i i think what a number of
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
members are saying
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
when they say rather than roll this into
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee or a study committee i
 
01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
think what they're saying is rather than
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
merely having this as a subcommittee
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
just a simple language adjustment there
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
my apologize apologies right murray i
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
did was supposed to call on you next so
 
01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead it's not a problem thank you mr
 
01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
chair i just i would like to take a
 
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
moment to say how incredibly grateful i
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
am for the work that the committee has
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
and continues to do on this subject and
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
and many other things around
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
environmental issues
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
and i think that we are we are keenly
 
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
aware that we
 
01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to address some of
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
the most pressing
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
issues around water
 
01:33:58.629 --> 01:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
drinking water whether it is a resource
 
01:34:01.110 --> 01:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
such as a perennial lake or river
 
01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.709 align:start position:0%
such as a perennial lake or river
and

01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
my desire in seeing this bill move
 
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
forward on a standalone would be that we
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
are taking a proactive measure instead
 
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
of a reactive measure
 
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
so with that um i'll just leave my
 
01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
thoughts there
 
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bixby yeah so
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of
 
01:34:23.669 --> 01:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
the relationship between
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
this standalone bill and the uh and this
 
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh 1049 study committee bill
 
01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:31.350 align:start position:0%
uh 1049 study committee bill
uh

01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
we the 1040 united society committee
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
bill is going to be looking at an awful
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff
 
01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:37.750 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff
and

01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
if we can pass this now
 
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh because we know it's good now
 
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
then that's one thing that we don't need
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
to spend as much time on in the 1049
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
study committee we can we we can say
 
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
okay we solved this part so we don't
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
need to spend as much time on this we
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
can focus on other aspects
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i guess i would
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
say in response regardless of whether we
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
pass it or not there's been great work
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
done on this bill by the by this
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and i i really appreciate
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
that and it will you know
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
if this bill isn't passed right this
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
minute and we at least have a great base
 
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
to work from and i i am greatly
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
appreciative of the work that the
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee did on this
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
do we have any further discussion or
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot of debate
 
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
and we're taking
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of time
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
and that's a good thing
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
um everybody who spoke here um has
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
brought important information to this
 
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.270 align:start position:0%
brought important information to this
debate

01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
debate
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
to this issue
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i get an open question
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
don't expect an answer but more or less
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
for thought
 
01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
is the study committee combination of
 
01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:53.669 align:start position:0%
is the study committee combination of
bills

01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
and a standalone bill mutually exclusive
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:00.070 align:start position:0%
or not
that's

01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
i don't want an answer i just
 
01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
food for thought
 
01:36:06.390 --> 01:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the amendment which
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
is a fine piece of work
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
and i commend the authors for it
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
stripped out a lot of what we had as
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
concern and that strip out material is
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
going to go into the study committee in
 
01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:21.669 align:start position:0%
going to go into the study committee in
1049

01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
1049
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
and it seems to have removed some really
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
sticky items of concern that were in the
 
01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
so i thank um
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
for the i'm thankful for the debate for
 
01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
all the points of view and for the fine
 
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
job on the amendment and that's all i'm
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
going to say thank you mr chair
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
and just as a
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
sort of a follow-up to that i i do
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate the debate myself i think we
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
have a great great committee and
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
certainly no offense to the members of
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
the other committees that are sitting in
 
01:36:59.340 --> 01:36:59.350 align:start position:0%
the substitutes but we're the best
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:37:01.430 align:start position:0%
the substitutes but we're the best
[Laughter]

01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
and it is my intention the bills that we
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
interim studied that
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
we included in part of 1049 my hope is
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
as long as the time permits in the
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
speaker's office will allow it is that
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
we will hold some interim study hearings
 
01:37:15.199 --> 01:37:16.310 align:start position:0%
we will hold some interim study hearings
on

01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
those subjects to continue to build the
 
01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
base and make the
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
1049 study committee
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
have a lot
 
01:37:27.109 --> 01:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
more detailed and better information
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
when they do convene to start with to
 
01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully take the workload off from
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
them because i do know we put a lot in
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
there and i fully recognize that and i
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
think that we as a committee can
 
01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
do a lot of the base work ourselves and
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
provide some great information to those
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
members who are assigned to that study
 
01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:44.950 align:start position:0%
members who are assigned to that study
committee

01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:47.270 align:start position:0%

a subcommittee
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
but if anything that needs to be changed
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%

01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%

comments

01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
i think we
 
01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
we've had a very good and thorough
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
discussion on this and um
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
so at this point uh
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to look go into executive
 
01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
session if there's

well i'm going to offer up a little
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's the chair
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
oh did we have some i'm sorry
 
01:41:59.830 --> 01:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative vicks we go ahead so i
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
think that uh we recognize that uh
 
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
we've gotten the language for this bill
 
01:42:07.590 --> 01:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
correct and
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
when you have something that works
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
it's time to go forward with it
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bixby
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
while i
 
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
agree that the language for the
 
01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
amendment is
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
excellent they've done a fantastic job i
 
01:42:23.109 --> 01:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
still have the same concern that i've
 
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
had and i've yet to have it debated that
 
01:42:25.119 --> 01:42:25.830 align:start position:0%
had and i've yet to have it debated that
we

01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
move as if we move this forward as a
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
standalone bill that we
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
are taking away some of the you know
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
what we've um charged the study
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
committee for in another bill that this
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
committee unanimously supported
 
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
and so i
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
have reservation about doing that and i
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
feel that while this is
 
01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
excellent legislation you know the
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
language is good but it would it would
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
be best served as a complete package and
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
once it's looked at and understood as to
 
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
how it relates to the entire section of
 
01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
landfill siting criteria and
 
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
and i haven't yet seen that passing this
 
01:43:02.790 --> 01:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
bill at this point in time
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
will have any impact on any current
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
applications that are in play and that's
 
01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
another concern that i had and i did
 
01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
reach out to the department of justice
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
through the department the des
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services and
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
they would not provide an official
 
01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:20.470 align:start position:0%
they would not provide an official
response

01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
response
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
to that because they didn't represent us
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
as the legislature
 
01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:26.629 align:start position:0%
as the legislature
but

01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
i have concerns that we are going you
 
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
know that we would have the
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of putting new rules into
 
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
place with an existing application
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
that's currently pending so i have some
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
concern about doing that
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
but my real concern is that i want to
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that the study committee has
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
the ability to do everything that we've
 
01:43:45.669 --> 01:43:45.679 align:start position:0%
charged it to do and i think we've
 
01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
provided a great base of information for
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
it representative bolton
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair i have a question
 
01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:54.629 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair i have a question
um

01:43:54.629 --> 01:43:54.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
you stated that if we passed this it
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
would take away some authority i think
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
is what you might have said um from the
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
the study committee would the study
 
01:44:04.709 --> 01:44:04.719 align:start position:0%
committee not be able to review the
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
changes that that we've made to statute
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
as well and have full authority to make
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
any recommendation they choose i believe
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
i said ability if i said authority was i
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
missed that
 
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
mistake misspeak on my part well they
 
01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
certainly can there's no question that
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
they can still look at it but i when
 
01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
when i look at a problem
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
that i go through with with my farm and
 
01:44:26.229 --> 01:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
my own business i i hate
 
01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
to have pieces taken off the table are
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
made more challenging and i think by
 
01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
passing this we just
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
we don't gain a lot immediately and i
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
think that we put in place
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
just something else that has to be
 
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
looked at and changed and i think we've
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
got a really good base here i really am
 
01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
supportive of the work that this
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
committee has done i think it will be an
 
01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
excellent piece of recommended
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
legislation that will come from the
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
study committee this fall and i just
 
01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
have yet to be convinced that passing it
 
01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:57.189 align:start position:0%
have yet to be convinced that passing it
now

01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
moves us ahead any you know any great
 
01:45:01.590 --> 01:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
distance because i
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
just did i yet to be convinced of that
 
01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:04.229 align:start position:0%
just did i yet to be convinced of that
so

01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
follow up certainly
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i just a question
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
if you had a fire on your farm would you
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
put it out first or would you study what
 
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
caused it
 
01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
well i think that's sort of a rhetorical
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
question and and i don't
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
know that i need to answer that one but
 
01:45:21.669 --> 01:45:21.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for it
 
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative dutzy
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh yeah my first career i've mentioned
 
01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:28.719 align:start position:0%
this before was as a social worker and
 
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
one of the tenets of social work is that
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
when you are confronted with a huge
 
01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:33.910 align:start position:0%
when you are confronted with a huge
problem

01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh you partialize it so you pick it
 
01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:37.750 align:start position:0%
uh you partialize it so you pick it
apart

01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
apart
 
01:45:41.189 --> 01:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
and you uh you put it into small pieces
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
so that you are able to solve that one
 
01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
piece and then you move
 
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
you have a plan and you move it forward
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
and i think that's exactly what we're
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
doing here we're looking at a huge plan
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
um we have studied this i i came in in
 
01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:59.270 align:start position:0%
um we have studied this i i came in in
2019

01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
2019
 
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
we've been studying this for
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
about three years now
 
01:46:03.119 --> 01:46:03.910 align:start position:0%
about three years now
we

01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
were told during the public hearing that
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
the bill that we started with was one of
 
01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:10.719 align:start position:0%
the best bills that they've ever seen
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
we've improved upon it
 
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
and i think we should partialize it by
 
01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
going ahead and
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
passing this bill now
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
you know if there's issues that the
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
interim study committee finds
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
they can deal with it then but i think
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
this is exactly the way that we should
 
01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
deal with it is by passing this bill now
 
01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:32.719 align:start position:0%
on a partial basis and moving the whole
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
issue forward
 
01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
again for clarification
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
this bill is gone uh that
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill in house bill
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
1454 is part of house bill 1049 which is
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
a study committee not an interim study
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
committee and i'm sorry and i'm not
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
trying to be technical i just don't want
 
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
to confuse people
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
in okay anybody else representative
 
01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.270 align:start position:0%
in okay anybody else representative

sorry and and i totally get what you're
 
01:47:01.119 --> 01:47:02.709 align:start position:0%
sorry and and i totally get what you're
saying

saying
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
repeatedly the study committee
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
um hb
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
1049 but
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
in reality if we pass this bill
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
stay alone we're going to prove the
 
01:47:14.709 --> 01:47:14.719 align:start position:0%
citizen in new hampshire that we're
 
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
taking seriously the problem that is
 
01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
happening right now
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
yes we're going to work in 10 49 and
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep continuing working
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
on the other issues that we have
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
by passing this bill
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
the only thing is going to do is prove
 
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
that this committee it cares about what
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
is happening right now and then we
 
01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
working towards getting
 
01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
the right things
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
to happen to to fixing the other issues
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
that we have in hp 1049 but i really i

really really
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
think that and then i
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
i'm 100 sure that if we pass on this
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
bill we proven we proven our community
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
