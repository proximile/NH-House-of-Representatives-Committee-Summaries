within the department health human
 
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
services and at that time it was
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
requested to table because the rules in
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%

00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
um i do have just a couple of questions
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
i know that you had sent something out
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that we all understand what is
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
happening with
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
the building you're in
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
and the building
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
that you vacated
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
because of asbestos etc
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
no problem so not specific necessarily
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
to this i suppose although tangentially
 
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.550 align:start position:0%
to this i suppose although tangentially
related

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
related
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
so presently the department of education
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
is housed in three sites uh one is at 25
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
hall street which is the
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
granite state college building which
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
they have for the most part vacated
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
when granite state college was
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
assimilated into unh
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
they still occupy one floor in that
 
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.470 align:start position:0%
they still occupy one floor in that
building

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
we rent space downtown in concord in an
 
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.710 align:start position:0%
we rent space downtown in concord in an
office

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
tower there
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
and that is where our special education
 
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
bureau is housed right now because we
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
could not fit them into 25 hall street
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
and then we have several bureaus over in
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
the walker building at the state
 
00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
most of the folks that have been
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
displaced are those who are at 25 hall
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
street at the granite state college or
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
in the downtown space
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
and formerly we were in lonergan
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
um where that project is uh so so we're
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
we don't actually manage because we
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
don't own the buildings that's managed
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
by des and i don't know if charlie wants
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
to weigh in on this or not but
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding is where we are in that
 
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.430 align:start position:0%
my understanding is where we are in that
project

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
is that we have
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
mitigated the flooring
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
we have taken out asbestos in the
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
ceilings in that building and then those
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
will have to be replaced or put back in
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
and that is ongoing as well there's a
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
capital project to replace the restrooms
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
in that building and so that is going to
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
be scheduled while we're not in the
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
building so it's not as disruptive the
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
fact that we're out of there
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
that work is scheduled to be completed
 
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
sometime in late fall our lease at
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
granite state college which released
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
from the university system
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
ends on december 15th so we provided a
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
little bit of cushion there in case the
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
project runs longer than expected
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
and we're just you know we're just
 
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
watching that project unfold um and
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
we'll see where it goes
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
okay and um
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
actually can i mention one other thing
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
so because we were out of the building
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
in lonergan so the department of
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
education has been housed there for a
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
long time
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
um and so we took advantage of the fact
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
that everybody was out there to do a
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
full uh purging of that building and i
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
may not get these right so i'm going to
 
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
talk to tammy but
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
which included going through every
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
single document in that building we had
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
three 30-foot dumpsters that uh cleared
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
out stuff like we're talking attic stuff
 
00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:49.430 align:start position:0%
out stuff like we're talking attic stuff
everything

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.310 align:start position:0%
everything
um

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
how many shredding trucks two
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
almost 200
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
200 boxes of shred of items that were
 
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
shredded they were um you know documents
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
that had pii on it so we cleared those
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
out um and and so basically the building
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
is completely empty at this point in
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
time um we also worked with the bureau
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
of archives as well as the state
 
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
librarian and we went through and
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
anything that had historical value we
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
preserved and um so i mean for example
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
we have educator records going back like
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
credential records from 1906 that we
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
preserved so okay
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
and um the the other question is i know
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
this is for air handling your 189
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh that was not included in the project
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
correct because the project was designed
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
principally around
 
00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
asbestos mitigation
 
00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:40.150 align:start position:0%
asbestos mitigation
okay

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
these dollars should cover your air
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
purification requirements
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
they should okay
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh could i have a uh
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sir uh
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%

as you know there's a
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
value of privacy
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
in this state that is important to the
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
public and the legislature

the public has that these drones will

absolutely thank you for the question
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
privacy is is important
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
and it's something that's definitely
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
considered within our program um the
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
programs run in accordance with all
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
federal and state laws
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%

department safety division of state
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
police um so we absolutely within our
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
policy um talk about the fact that we
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
will comply with all parts of article 1
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
part 19 of the new hampshire
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
constitution on top of obviously the
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
fourth amendment here in the united
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
states and
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
we even go a little bit farther in our
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
policy that if we are going to be doing
 
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.110 align:start position:0%
policy that if we are going to be doing
anything

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
as far as surveillance or anything like
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
that we will absolutely be apply for a
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
search warrant prior to doing anything
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
to do with surveillance
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
any exits and circumstances um we will
 
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.269 align:start position:0%
any exits and circumstances um we will
fall

00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
fall
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
obviously within the rules of that but
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
we take privacy very important we also
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
do not retain any of the information
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
unless it is needed for
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
prosecution so we will immediately get
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
rid of the the video or anything that
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
we've captured that we don't need
 
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.910 align:start position:0%
we've captured that we don't need
follow-up

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
this policy is it governed by statute or
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
rules or
 
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.389 align:start position:0%
rules or
just

00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
so about policy
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
sure a little bit of everything we have
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
um stuff that absolutely curtails to
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
certain laws supreme court cases that
 
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
have come across due to surveillance um
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
we also have um we've gone a little bit
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
above and beyond that
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
back when representative um kirk was
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
here we sat down for a long time and
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
talked about the different um aspects of
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
what we would want to have in our
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
program back in 2017 when we were first
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
initially doing that and we sat down and
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
actually talked with him about
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
what kind of things would be needed to
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
be in place
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
so i i echo the concerns about privacy
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
i'm really glad that you guys have a
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
policy i'm looking forward to reading it
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
when you provide it to the commit
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
committee uh i
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh i'm curious how
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh what you considered to be a disaster
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
because the term is is the term disaster
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
defined somewhere on on when you can
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
is it defined i don't i don't know i'm
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
not sure if it is actually defined um
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
using that
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
to basically map any kind of whether the
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
disaster or
 
00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.150 align:start position:0%
disaster or
the

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
um could you speak into the marketplace
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah we're on youtube so people
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
need to hear you sure whether it's a
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
disaster or whether it's um something
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
that we're helping another state agency
 
00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.150 align:start position:0%
that we're helping another state agency
map

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
map
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
say like a flood
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
all those different things we're using
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
them for mapping and to see the damage
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
and do damage assessment with them right
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
um is there an actual definition that
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
we've used or that i utilized to do that
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
i i don't think i did um
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
so i don't have a actual
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
definition for you
 
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.430 align:start position:0%
definition for you
follow-up

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up so what you're picking up on
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
is is that
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
we have constituents who are extremely
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about their privacy and uh and
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
from a cynical perspective would like to
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
know exactly where the boundary
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
conditions are
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
do you think you're going to need an mou
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
with fish and games because that's
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
another big scenario with them out with
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
a lost hiker or something
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
so we already have been utilizing them
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
with fish and game to and
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
give you an example the other uh day
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
when uh the gentleman was missing up in
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
monroe um we were helping fishing game
 
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.390 align:start position:0%
monroe um we were helping fishing game
um

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
for hours looking for um that that lost
 
00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:23.669 align:start position:0%
for hours looking for um that that lost
um

00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:23.679 --> 00:19:24.789 align:start position:0%
um
gentleman

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
gentleman
 
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
if we were to
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
table this item until we could see the
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
written policies would there be any
 
00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.750 align:start position:0%
written policies would there be any
emergent

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
emergent
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
operationally i don't think so um
 
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.630 align:start position:0%
operationally i don't think so um
the

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
where the source that we're trying to
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
acquire these um uas is from um there
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
will be a price increase so that could
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
um that could be a problem um i know
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
they have a june 1st price increase
 
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.990 align:start position:0%
they have a june 1st price increase
coming

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
so that could be that could be an issue
 
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:06.799 align:start position:0%
for us
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
well it's only april
 
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
senator daniels
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any reason why we
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't uh rent these as opposed to
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
renting wasn't really considered as a as
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
a viable option because of the funding
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
source so these are federal federal
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
funds that have a grant period of
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
performance that have to be spent within
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
two-year period of time um if we went
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
into a lease arrangement that could
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
exceed three five years and that would
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
shift these costs to to be state costs
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
so in this particular case it makes the
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
most sense for us to purchase these uh
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
we're also
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
not certain that there are a lot of
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
options to lease these
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
these aircraft because they are aircraft
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
they have to be registered
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
with the faa their
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
the liability and all the concerns
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
surrounding the aircraft are tied to the
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
owner and that brings up some unique
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
some unique challenges so
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
in this particular case the the purchase
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
option was chosen
 
00:21:10.159 --> 00:21:11.350 align:start position:0%
option was chosen
follow-up

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up and uh
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
is there a reason why we can't use
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
manned aircraft
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding is that these
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
provide us with
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
these aircraft can can
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
fly at lower levels they can fly over
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
areas that manned aircraft
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
can't currently
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
they also can fly during conditions
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
that manned aircraft can't fly through
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
higher wind speeds
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
and it takes away that risk of of having
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
an individual in a dangerous situation
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
well let the sergeant expound on that
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
i would concur with all that the other
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
aspect of this is um a lot of the use is
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
for mapping um so those cameras we don't
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
have that kind of camera system either
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
on our fixed wing or on our helicopter
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
to help us map
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
serious motor vehicle collisions um
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
crime scenes
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
disaster as the other representative
 
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
brought up all of those things a lot of
 
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.310 align:start position:0%
brought up all of those things a lot of
these

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
uas's are used for photography and for
 
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.830 align:start position:0%
uas's are used for photography and for
mapping

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
mapping
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh thank you um
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
so kind of a two-part question um
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
do you have visibility into how many of
 
00:22:27.919 --> 00:22:29.350 align:start position:0%
do you have visibility into how many of
these

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
are owned by our counties or other
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
government and
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
and like for example i know rockingham
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
county purchased one and our nursing
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
home has an mou with whoever purchased
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
it so that if a patient wanders off they
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
can use it to help find the patient so
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
so it just makes me wonder
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
is is is there sort of a inventory
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
visibility to where
 
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
not every state government agency needs
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
their own drone that we but we can have
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
a pool of them shareable
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
it's a great question i don't know how
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
many people actually have them it is
 
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
obviously an emerging technology that a
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
lot of people are utilizing
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
we were one of the the first groups to
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
have them
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to who has them
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
or if there is that ability to do that
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
we do have a a statewide
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
uas users group that allows any entity
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
to participate to see how there are
 
00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.830 align:start position:0%
to participate to see how there are
currently

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
due to covid we haven't met in quite
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
some time i would say there's probably
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
15 to 20 entities across the state that
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
were part of that so i'm sure there's
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up so it just makes me wonder if
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
um if we need sort of uh some
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
legislation to go with this next year
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
just to put somebody overall in the
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
state in charge of these drones so that
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
they can maintain an inventory and
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
manage a
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
an interagency sharing program because i
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
hate to see
 
00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:01.590 align:start position:0%
hate to see
us

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
buy in more drones than what we really
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
need just because everyone is stove
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
piped and doesn't see to the left or to
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
the right of them so
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm i i may want to come back to you
 
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
and ask you who the legit lead agency
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
for something like that might be
 
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.549 align:start position:0%
for something like that might be
certainly

00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
senator guida thank you madam chair uh
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
how many additional how many drones do
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
we have and how many additional will
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
this appropriation authorize the
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
purchase of so currently we have two
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
that we purchased back in
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
2018 was our purchase of them um
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
currently where um what the grant
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
applications applying for is 25 and it's
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
a different um
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
basically it's a different
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
platform use
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
back in 2017 we went with something
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
called the arion sky ranger which is a
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
much larger platform
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
that company was then purchased by a
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
company called flir
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
and then teledyne
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
and it is it's at its end of life um so
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
these are going to be a smaller um drone
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
that is uh far these are far more
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
capable and it will also allow us to
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
instead of having a central point right
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
now if um someone needs to utilize them
 
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
we actually have to drive to concord to
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
the hangar at airport road and then um
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
and then deploy from there um this will
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
give us the ability to have them in
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
of better distribution throughout the
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
state um it also allows us to be able to
 
00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
be on scene quicker instead of people
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
waiting for us to do things
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
waiting for roads to stay shut down for
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
longer periods of time
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
waiting for our canines not to be able
 
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
to start a search and give them that
 
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.789 align:start position:0%
to start a search and give them that
ability

00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
ability
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
so it's just a larger distribution and
 
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:42.950 align:start position:0%
so it's just a larger distribution and
each

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
each
 
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.070 align:start position:0%
each
pilot

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
pilot
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
that will be piloting these uh aircraft
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
will each be
 
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh have three they'll have a small
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
indoor option to help with our swat and
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
our tactical teams and then they'll have
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
basically a day and a night use and then
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
a solely a um one purpose mapping um
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up so with the current current
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
fleet of two
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh how how often do you deploy these
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
um i have do we have our
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
i would say
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
once to twice a week we're using them
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
for some something
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
in some realm
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
whether uh training whether a call for
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
service whether another agency asking
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
for help or within our own agency
 
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.870 align:start position:0%
for help or within our own agency
um

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
in the situation in monroe i can tell
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
you we were up there flying at one point
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
and then we were down at the on the
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
everett turnpike
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
a a collision scene
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
within the same day so
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
it varies day to day
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
like i would echo representative edwards
 
00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:48.799 align:start position:0%
interest in assimilating a centralized
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
group of these and using them
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
for other agencies around the state i
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
think because we will absolutely sense
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i didn't mean to interrupt you uh
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
we absolutely will and if anybody calls
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
us we won't say no to go help them
 
00:27:01.039 --> 00:27:02.149 align:start position:0%
us we won't say no to go help them
obviously

00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a group effort to make sure
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
that this happens and if anybody needs
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
us or needs us to respond we're
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely coming to help them thank you
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
represent army
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
it sounds like they're going to be a lot
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
of people around the state making
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
decisions about whether something is an
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
emergency and is an authorized flight or
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
not is there any kind of chain and of
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
command in your policy
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
yeah yes ma'am um so um for the
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
the ability for these um aircraft to
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
deploy um it has to come through myself
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
to make that decision whether that's a
 
00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
deployable um option we also have a
 
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
checklist um that absolutely tells us
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
when and when we can't um can't deploy
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
these type of aircraft um and then above
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
obviously above my pay grade we have um
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
bosses and so forth that are immediately
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
notified if that um that aircraft's
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
gonna fly um so if that aircraft's gonna
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
fly there's a page that goes out to our
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
command staff that says this is
 
00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:06.230 align:start position:0%
command staff that says this is
happening

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%

and um
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.350 align:start position:0%
as you know
um

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
we generally meet the third friday of

the month
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
so as soon as we can get that it would
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
be appreciated you'll have it today okay
 
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's anyone here that
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
is necessarily opposed to
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
the the drones but we just want to uh
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing for our

senator rosenwald thank you madam chair
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
um your narrative says that
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
the department has taken on moral
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility and needs these
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
positions my question is
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
did these positions come up during the
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
budget process in either the house
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
or the senate when
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
you knew about the responsibilities
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
and did we say no
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
or did you not request them
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question these
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
positions did not come up during the the
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
budget process
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
um so we did not request them and nobody
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
has denied them the reason they didn't
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
come up is because at the time the
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
division of homeland security and
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
emergency management was was actively
 
00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:12.149 align:start position:0%
emergency management was was actively
engaged

00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
engaged
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
in response to the covet 19 pandemic
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
and the eoc was fully activated
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
while we submitted a complete budget
 
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.590 align:start position:0%
while we submitted a complete budget
request

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
the time spent on long-term needs like
 
00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:27.830 align:start position:0%
the time spent on long-term needs like
these

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
just wasn't available
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
to put forth these types of requests so
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
now that kovit has has the cove
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
emergency is is no longer in effect
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
the agency was able to reconsider their
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
structure especially given their their
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility since then and determined
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
that these positions were needed
 
00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.470 align:start position:0%
that these positions were needed
yes

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%

interested in supporting
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
and the director and her team have done
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
a good job in filling vacancies so we do
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
believe that there's a desire for these
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
particular positions and that we will be
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%

d.a.s on hiring so

d.a.s on hiring so
uh

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
yes uh senator uh representative edwards
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair uh this is a
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
little generic for the whole state but
 
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
since you're here i'm going to ask you
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
when we hire
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
new people off the street
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
into the temporary full-time positions
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
is there any encouragement that we do in
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
that process to have them sign up for
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
the 403 b instead of
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
our pension program
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
and if there's not
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
should there be so that we can start to
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
um i i think that's
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
it's that that's a good question um
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
at this point with our hiring challenges
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
we're looking to
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
hire individuals who are capable of
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
doing the job and aren't quite frankly
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
that focused on
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
transitioning one way or the other
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
i do think that i mean it's if it's a
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
statewide question it's probably an
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
administrative services response that
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
you'll be looking for and if you look
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
if you look over your shoulder
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
there we go um
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
but as far as in the department of
 
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.350 align:start position:0%
but as far as in the department of
safety

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
all retirement options are provided to
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
the individual we don't necessarily
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
encourage them to go one direction or
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
the other we're providing them with all
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%

00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
the state's deferred comp plan
 
00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:29.109 align:start position:0%
the state's deferred comp plan
um

00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
employees when they hire are encouraged
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
to consider the deferred complaint it's
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
a voluntary plan obviously
 
00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:37.139 align:start position:0%

and karen lucas formerly karen rounds

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald you have a question i
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
do thank you good morning miss tillian
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
ms lucas
 
00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:20.630 align:start position:0%
ms lucas
um

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's a lot to spring on us that's a
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
this is faulty testable
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:32.790 align:start position:0%
thank you um
i'm

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
wondering how good the data we're
 
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
getting from the pharmacies on
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
vaccinations is now
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
particularly if someone has traveled to
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
a pharmacy
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
in another state
 
00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.510 align:start position:0%
in another state
um

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
because i know we were having trouble
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
breaking down the vaccination rate into
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
um first shot second shot
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
booster now second booster
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
how confident are we in
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
what our vaccination picture looks like
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you senator rosenwald for that
 
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
question so things are getting better um
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
we have brought on our pharmacies within
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire from december
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
on they are giving us new information
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
from december on so that's great um you
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
know i think there is still some
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
question around how to count all those
 
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.270 align:start position:0%
question around how to count all those
boosters

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
boosters
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
and part of that is because
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
data the pharmacies sent their data as
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
we all know last summer and early on
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
directly to the federal government did
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
not send it to us when we send our data
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
to the federal government we actually
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
send de-identified data so there's no
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
way to match at that point so i know how
 
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
the number of vaccines that were given
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
i'm actually very quite confident in in
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
the number of doses that have been
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
administered in the state of new
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire it's less clear about how i
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
can tie that to an individual that they
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
received a first a second a first
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
booster and a second booster to
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
understand how many people may be fully
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
boosted at this particular time it beca
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
it gets even more complicated when
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
people received their vaccines in
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
multiple states my own daughter received
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
that you was in college so she received
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
part of her vaccination in in chicago
 
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
she received part of her vaccination
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
here it because we don't send that
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
identifiable data to
 
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
cdc it's hard to match we did some work
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
on our part to try and voluntarily get
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
that information from folks we did a
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
phone calling system and texting to
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
folks to say can you tell us you know it
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
looks like you didn't have a completed
 
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
series did you receive your vaccine
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
elsewhere again that was completely
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
voluntary but with any of those call
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
back processes you only get a small
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
perpet proportion of folks who actually
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
pick up the phone and ant you know that
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
are willing to answer in the first place
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
but pick up the phone and are able to
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
share their information
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you so that doesn't give
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
me a lot of confidence but if i'm a
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
member of the public which i am and i
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
want to get a record of my own now for
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinations how do i do that
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
so you could do that in a number of ways
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
you can reach if you received your
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines through a state-run site
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
you know you went to one of the national
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
guard sites early on or to one of our
 
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.870 align:start position:0%
guard sites early on or to one of our
vendors

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
vendors
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
you can certainly call there's a way to
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
call the department of health and human
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
services and we will share back the
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
information for you with you if you
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
received your vaccines in a pharmacy um
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
we recommend people to not only call us
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
we we may have some of that data we may
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
not so it's good to go to the pharmacy
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
themselves and get that information from
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy directly or if you went to
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
your own private physician to get that
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
information this is why a vaccine
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
registry and having a complete and
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
consolidated vaccine registry is so
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
important because we know that many
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
people want to make sure that they have
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
all the information in one place and
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
that's where we're moving towards but
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know we know that there are pieces
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
because we were having so many different
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
ways that people got vaccinated
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
especially in those early days um that
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's not always as straightforward
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
just quick follow-up so if i lose my
 
00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.910 align:start position:0%
just quick follow-up so if i lose my
card

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
card
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
and have gotten
 
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
one vaccination in
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
massachusetts at one pharmacy chain
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
and another one in new hampshire at a
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
different pharmacy chain
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
am i hearing that there will not be a
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
way for me to
 
00:41:45.359 --> 00:41:46.390 align:start position:0%
way for me to
get

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
that card replaced from the department
 
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.550 align:start position:0%
that card replaced from the department
with

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
all the information on it i would
 
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
recommend in that in the case of that
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
scenario a person to call
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
services we will see what we have um
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
available to us we know that
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
the cross-state uh vaccine has has
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
always been challenging and so the next
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
if if that information isn't fully there
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
we would give you recommendations of
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
where to go next of contacting each of
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
i thought i'd put some light on the
 
00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.109 align:start position:0%
i thought i'd put some light on the
subject

00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
great welcome representative edwards uh
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so miss tilly
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
would you uh address the the question or
 
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
the the concerns of the five to ten
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
percent of new hampshire's population
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
which will see more federal money going
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
into our vaccine program
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
and immediately worry about whether this
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
creates a new privacy risk or whether
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to be using this money to
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
force the vaccine on kids
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative edwards we are not
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
forcing vaccine on anyone including
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
children we have um there is no school
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
requirement for covet 19 vaccine nor do
 
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
we anticipate that there will be
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
so that's a matter of choice for
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
families families should do what is
 
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
right for them and for their children
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
given their scenario their own
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
situations similarly for adults as a as
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
an adult in the state of new hampshire
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
no one the department of health and
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
human services is not requiring covid19
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
vaccine for anyone
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
i think to your other question of what
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
are these funds going to be used for
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
these funds are going to be used to
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
stabilize and enhance some of the
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
connections of the data system that we
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
have in place it will further support
 
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
that it's going to improve the data
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
quality that we have to answer senator
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
rosenwald's question it will give us
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
more manpower to be able to do you know
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
make sure all those historical data
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
pieces fit together
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
as well as moving forward that our data
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
is as strong and robust and secure as
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
possible and it's also going to allow us
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
to do things like purchase necessary
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
equipment like refrigerators and
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
freezers so that we can keep all our
 
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines safe so that when your child is
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
getting their routine childhood
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinations we know that that there is
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
a chain of custody that has been safe
 
00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:21.829 align:start position:0%
a chain of custody that has been safe
and

00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know that that is the appropriate
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
follow up uh so thank you for that as
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
you know from prior conversations those
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
are the kind of questions and
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
accusations i i tend to get so
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
kind of a long-standing theme
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
i've had in this committee is that
 
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.670 align:start position:0%
i've had in this committee is that
we

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
continue to see incremental additions to
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
our i.t budget and
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
one of these days i'd really like to get
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
around to having an entire discussion
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
focused on the i.t portfolio and all the
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
projects flowing into it and all the
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
money that's flowing into it because the
 
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
this one at a time kind of nature just
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
makes me worry a little bit about the
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
the department's visibility into the
 
00:45:13.839 --> 00:45:15.030 align:start position:0%
the department's visibility into the
entire

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
entire
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh project portfolio that you you guys
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
must be carrying
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
so that that's again just another heads
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
up and i i think
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
hhs oversight is going to be asking for
 
00:45:25.359 --> 00:45:26.790 align:start position:0%
hhs oversight is going to be asking for
something

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
thank you you know the only comment that
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
i would feedback is that we have been
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
working hand in hand across the
 
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.829 align:start position:0%
working hand in hand across the
department

00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
with our data governance and
 
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
understanding that this is that to your
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
point we've had siloed pieces of federal
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
funding supporting a larger system
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
i am confident that there is a
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
leadership team within the department
 
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
that is managing those resources and
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
ensuring that things are being
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
efficiently used and that they are
 
00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
serving the
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure of the department to the
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
degree that is possible as well as us

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.390 align:start position:0%
to make sure
that

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
students that aren't currently enrolled
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
are aware of this
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
financial opportunity so that they can
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
use that information to go enter a
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
program i i just think there's a lot of
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
kids a lot of people
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
that would like to become lpns but if we
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
have this program they may not ever
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
become aware of it and therefore they
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources to go so how do
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
we connect the dots
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's fantastic thing to bring up we
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%

community partners both in the high
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
and connect with not only young people
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
but people who are coming back into the
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
workforce to let them know about these
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
programs part of our
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
outreach and
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
development plans include all of that i

development all over
 
00:50:54.069 --> 00:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
the state and work with our partners to

of the system to help people meet their
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
educational goals because the financial
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
burden is challenging for someone who's
 
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
trying to pull themselves up
 
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
and build a career who maybe was is
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%

00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
sector of the workforce or their first
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%

broadly speaking uh these two items
together

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:11.750 align:start position:0%
together

help the state

make material advances
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
in addressing the long-standing
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
so-called emergency
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
room boarding crisis
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
last year the supreme court ruled
 
00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.150 align:start position:0%
last year the supreme court ruled
that

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
00:56:30.559 --> 00:56:31.910 align:start position:0%
a uh
patient

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
patient
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
for whom there is an invo voluntary uh
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
emergency admission petition filed again
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
must have a probable cause hearing
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
within three days of the signing
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
certificate for admission
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
previously the hearings had been held
 
00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:50.870 align:start position:0%
previously the hearings had been held
upon

00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
upon
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
the patient entering either new
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital or a designated
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
receiving facility
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
what makes the change in law important
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
is now the hearings must be held within
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
three days
 
00:57:02.799 --> 00:57:03.589 align:start position:0%
three days
and

00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
often those patients are in our local
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms waiting for a bed at
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
either the hospital or the drf
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
this crea creates a is
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
required reordering the way these
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
hearings were held
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
and basically the issue came down to
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the patients
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
and the attorneys who are appointed
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
receive notice on a prompt basis
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
the circuit court has
 
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.430 align:start position:0%
the circuit court has
devised

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
devised
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
and engineered a system to ensure that
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
these hearings are held within three
 
00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.270 align:start position:0%
these hearings are held within three
days

00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
with the patient often in the emergency
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
room but that has turned into a very
 
00:57:45.599 --> 00:57:46.549 align:start position:0%
room but that has turned into a very
very

00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
intensive process
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
involving clerks
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
at many of our local circuit courts
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
working closely with hospitals and
 
00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:57.030 align:start position:0%
working closely with hospitals and
clinicians

00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
clinicians
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
and as well as appointed counsel to
 
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:00.549 align:start position:0%
and as well as appointed counsel to
ensure

00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
ensure
 
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
that the patient gets timely notice
 
00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:04.309 align:start position:0%
that the patient gets timely notice
and

00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
and a hearing is held
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
i'm pleased to report that since our new
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
process has been implemented on march
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
21st there have been 176 hearings held
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
in only two
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
instances where the three-day deadline
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
was not met and there was a dismissal
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
and that is a dramatic improvement from
 
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
where we are
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
the issue for the circuit court however
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
is that this is not sustainable we've
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
had to divert both judicial and staff
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
resources to make this work
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
and the proposal in these two items with
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
before you is to create a
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
permanent sustainable system for uh
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
processing these
 
00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:50.549 align:start position:0%
processing these
um

00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:50.559 --> 00:58:51.990 align:start position:0%
um
petitions

00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
petitions
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
and essentially what it involves is the
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
creation of a statewide centralized
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
docket at the circuit court
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
to which we will devote two judges and
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
four staff
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
and they will handle on a centralized
 
00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.390 align:start position:0%
and they will handle on a centralized
basis

00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
all iea petitions wherever they arise
 
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
and we will we believe this will help us
 
00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:19.349 align:start position:0%
and we will we believe this will help us
achieve

00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
the statutory and indeed constitutional
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
mandate to ensure due process for our
 
00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.990 align:start position:0%
mandate to ensure due process for our
patients

00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh while also achieving frankly
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
efficiencies in the system instead of
 
00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.109 align:start position:0%
efficiencies in the system instead of
having

00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
eight separate circuit courts handling
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
hearings on any given day we're going to
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
be doing it in one place with a
 
00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:38.799 align:start position:0%
specialized docket
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
so that manim chair is a summary of
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
these two items the gopher item provides
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
the funding for it and the judicial
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
branch item crete essentially creates
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
the two new judicial positions
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
if you remember members of the committee
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
i was before you we were before you in
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
january seeking the conversion of a
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
mayoral master position there does ex
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
exist authority within
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
statute for us to seek approval of this
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
committee to convert marital master
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
positions to circuit judges judge
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
positions so the judicial branch item
 
01:00:15.839 --> 01:00:16.630 align:start position:0%
positions so the judicial branch item
would

01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
convert two marital master positions to
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
circuit judge positions to facilitate
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
the creation of our statewide mental
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
are there questions senator gaidan
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh chief justice good to see you
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
likewise how many of these iea petition
 
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
cases are there on an annual basis the
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
we estimate that the creation of the
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
stock will involve 2600 cases in and i
 
01:00:46.319 --> 01:00:47.910 align:start position:0%
stock will involve 2600 cases in and i
would

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:48.789 align:start position:0%
would
um

01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
i think that's the right number 2600
 
01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.470 align:start position:0%
i think that's the right number 2600
senator

01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
and that was it follow-up
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you is that based on historical or
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
are there furthers
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald thank you madam chair
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
good morning um there was a newspaper
 
01:01:08.079 --> 01:01:09.349 align:start position:0%
good morning um there was a newspaper
story

01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
story
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
saying that you had sent a memo to the
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
about your pilot test and i i never
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
received it
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you could
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
resend it i i'm wondering if there were
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the article said
 
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
but maybe perhaps it was referring to
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
the item that we submitted i don't know
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
it referred to a four-week pilot program
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
that you've been running and when i
 
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
reread the item
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
it didn't mention a four week program so
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
i thought perhaps there was
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
you're not the only one that didn't oh
 
01:01:51.119 --> 01:01:52.390 align:start position:0%
you're not the only one that didn't oh
okay

so uh
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
senator apparently there were questions
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
that came in to gopher
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh yesterday from the committee and i
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%

01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
there was a memo that was submitted so
 
01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.549 align:start position:0%
there was a memo that was submitted so
i'm

i'm
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
i got that correct
 
01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.190 align:start position:0%
i got that correct
well

01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%

01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
did it got lost in our inbox yeah you
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
received several emails from your
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
pre-fiscal questions so it would be a
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
response from um
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
gopher but you should receive that
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon it wasn't a
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
memo more of an answer to the questions
 
01:02:45.359 --> 01:02:46.150 align:start position:0%
memo more of an answer to the questions
but

01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any specific memo from
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch relative to that
 
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
pilot program um
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
but i can i can absolutely search my
 
01:02:55.039 --> 01:02:55.990 align:start position:0%
but i can i can absolutely search my
inbox

01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
inbox
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
okay for sure okay
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
senator daniels thank you
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
did i understand correctly that the the
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
funding requested in in 149 would at
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
least in part
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
pay for the new positions that you were
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:12.630 align:start position:0%
asking for
yes

01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:15.510 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.549 align:start position:0%
 
where

01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
you are using one-time money through
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
opera to pay for this
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
with a notation that in the event that
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
federal funds are no longer available
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
general funds will not be requested
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
i thought i understood you to say that
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
you were you were looking for this to be
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
an ongoing thing so how is that going to
 
01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.270 align:start position:0%
an ongoing thing so how is that going to
work

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
we would have to come and request
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's what's that's my point is
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
the notation says that you would not be
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
i think he what he's if if i might
 
01:03:52.559 --> 01:03:53.510 align:start position:0%
i think he what he's if if i might
that

01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
he's not
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
with this but the startup of the program
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
he would not be requesting general funds
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
however for continuation of the program
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
which is down in fis 147
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
that would in fact be general funds
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
it's a request for general funds
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
would be budgeted for
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
the future
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
01:04:26.559 --> 01:04:28.549 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
if

01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
the marital masters had had been funded
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
in the current budget
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
for 22 and 23
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
and that um
 
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
this would uh
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
not cost anything for the next two years
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
or the next year and a half
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
but would be um
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
budgeted in 24 and 25.
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
is that sort of right it's that's
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
are there further questions uh
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
you both
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
came across the main question i had
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
given that we're going to be having to
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
budget for this in the out years could
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
we get a sense of what we're talking
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
about are we talking an extra million a
 
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
year to your budget a couple million
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
let's wait until we get to fis
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
22 146 yes ma'am okay that's that's
 
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%

we'll look forward to seeing you in just
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh department of business and economic

uh department of business and economic
affairs

01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
affairs
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
and i notice he doesn't have a helper
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
with him this time
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i think maybe what
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
i might do if it's okay with you is just
 
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
to take one quick moment to
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
give an overview of uh this particular
 
01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:56.630 align:start position:0%
give an overview of uh this particular
item

01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
item
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
which is a request to accept and spend a
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
little over 100 million dollars
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
to address the housing issues that were
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
housing issues we're currently having in
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
the state which i'm sure that you're all
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
acutely aware of
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
there aren't too many businesses in the
 
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
state right now that are not having
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
difficulty finding workforce
 
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
and this in particular uh is caused uh
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
increasingly by the lack of available
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
and affordable housing
 
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
and so this measure is designed to begin
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
to assist in the uh alleviation of those
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
problems by using uh this once really
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
once in a lifetime opportunity
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
to put this amount of money towards
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
this issue here in the state
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
we're currently looking at as you may
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
have heard last week a reduction of our
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate again to two and a
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
half percent
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
and the statewide vacancy rate for two
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
bedroom apartments right now in the
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
state is at point six percent
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
so that is very far from a healthy
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
environment for
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
available and affordable housing
 
01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
so this uh these these there are two
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
main components to
 
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
the item that's in front of you
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
the first is with regard to
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities and their role in
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
in helping to move forward uh housing
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
initiatives locally
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
by giving them
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
some funding that would be associated
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
with the permitting of these rental
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
units in their communities
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
to the tune of ten thousand dollars per
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
unit that they would then be able to
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
have some flexibility in the use of
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
those funds whether it's for uh
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
you know items in direct relation to the
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
project itself or for anything else
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
that that the community may feel they
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
need to use those funds for
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
within that there are two other programs
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
one is regarding uh the
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
zoning process and the planning process
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
to assist communities that would seek to
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
have a review or an update of their
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
zoning regulations
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
that is a program that's currently
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
operates on a lower level uh municipal
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
technical assistance grant program
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
administered by new hampshire housing
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
finance authority
 
01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:11.990 align:start position:0%
finance authority
this

01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
program would potentially be able to
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
improve the ability for that program to
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
provide those services
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
to communities without a match
 
01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:22.870 align:start position:0%
to communities without a match
to

01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
understand what their
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
zoning options might be and what the
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
development options and how
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
projects are funded and how that process
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
goes i think that that would be
 
01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of communities are welcome
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
a welcome uh
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
opportu resource
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
the last piece under the municipality
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
component has to do with the demolition
 
01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:43.349 align:start position:0%
component has to do with the demolition
of

01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
buildings that are no longer habitable
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of situations where we
 
01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:49.110 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of situations where we
have

01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh projects either that are underway or
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
that would would be underway if not for
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
some older infrastructure that is
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
effectively in the way without the
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
resources to remove that structure so
 
01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
that this program would be a grant
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
program that would be available
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
for those communities to take that
 
01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.590 align:start position:0%
for those communities to take that
action

01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
the second part
 
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
of the funding is really project
 
01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.310 align:start position:0%
of the funding is really project
specific

01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
this would be a total of 60 60 million
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
dollars 50 million of which
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
would be aimed at
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
a series of
 
01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.990 align:start position:0%
a series of
um

01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
eligibilities these would be
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
funds that would effectively be last
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
money in a lot of cases to a whole host
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
of different types of projects
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
those projects
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
would come
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
with a demonstrated need to be able to
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
establish a funding gap at the
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
at the far end of the development
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
process and so
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
just a quick overview would be that
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
these are for multi-family projects a
 
01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.070 align:start position:0%
these are for multi-family projects a
rental

01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
rental
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
component rental projects five units and
 
01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.390 align:start position:0%
component rental projects five units and
above

01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
above
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
the funds would be used exclusively for
 
01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.229 align:start position:0%
the funds would be used exclusively for
construction

01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
construction
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
or other hard costs that are associated
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
with the project
 
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
the project itself must add to the
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
housing stock that is available in the
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
community so
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be doing a lot of
 
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation of existing units with
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
this with these funds
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
all the permits would have to be in
 
01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.709 align:start position:0%
all the permits would have to be in
place

01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
which sort of gets to my point of this
 
01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
being further along in the in the
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
development process
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
and all the developers from the small
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
developers right on through
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
this would be a dollar for dollar match
 
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
program so any award that was made the
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
developer would have to demonstrate a
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
dollar for dollar match of investment in
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
that project themselves
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
there is a cap of three million dollars
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
per project
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
that is not going to always be a three
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
million dollar
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
grant that is the upper echelon of what
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
the project
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
would be able to take from this this
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
program uh we would invisib envision
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
probably uh regular
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
um regular funding rounds
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh over the course of the next year
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
through june of 2023
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
there would be
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
a requirement that the projects be
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
completed within 18 months
 
01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.270 align:start position:0%
completed within 18 months
of

01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
the of at least the funding
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
and lastly on that point i would say
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
an important one is that there are
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements that we have to
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
contend with on the federal side of this
 
01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.709 align:start position:0%
contend with on the federal side of this
so

01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
any of the funds that would be requested
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
would be only paid out in a reimbursable
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
basis after there was a review of
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
eligibility and
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
and appropriateness of the of the
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
requested funds to fit into what some of
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
the categories that i talked about there
 
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
there are obviously other details that
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
are going to need to be developed i
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
think this is a good sort of
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
overview of where we are right now
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
you'll recall a couple of months well
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
weeks ago now
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
we talked about some funding that would
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
be associated with the uh hiring of some
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
staff to come start administering and
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
making this program operational
 
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're in the process of getting those
 
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh into those jobs posted and hopefully
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
individuals into those jobs soon to sort
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
of start mapping out the final details
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
as it relates to what i just provided to
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
you so i think maybe i'll just stop
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
right there and if there's questions of
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
course certainly happy to try and answer
 
01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.350 align:start position:0%
course certainly happy to try and answer
them

01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
senator gaidan thank you madam chair and
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
several questions can you discuss the
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
federal eligibility criteria
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
so we would be
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
placing these funds into a bucket called
 
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
revenue replacement
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
which gives us some degree of
 
01:13:46.719 --> 01:13:48.070 align:start position:0%
which gives us some degree of
flexibility

01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
but there are
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
certain restrictions on how the program
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
is used by the developer as it relates
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
to things like two cfr 200 and the use
 
01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
of federal procurement rules
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
a few other
 
01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.229 align:start position:0%
a few other
eligibility

01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
components that we would need to
 
01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.030 align:start position:0%
components that we would need to
consider

01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
for all of these but the basic thrust of
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
it is that
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
with the layout that i just provided you
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's designed uh to fit within the box
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
that we're we're designing we're working
 
01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.310 align:start position:0%
that we're we're designing we're working
with

01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.669 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:14:23.679 --> 01:14:25.189 align:start position:0%
follow-up
so

01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
would it be safe to assume
 
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
dangerous word
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
requirements for certain income levels
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
appropriated with these projects
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
income levels of the project do you mean
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
no income levels of the tenants who will
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
populate these oh so um not within these
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
specific federal rules what the uh pro
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
what the program is designed to do
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
is to be able to help cover gaps again
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
near the end of a project
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
of a whole host of different types of
 
01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:02.070 align:start position:0%
of a whole host of different types of
projects

01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
most of those projects that we will see
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
and that will that will be eligible
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
coming forward will be projects that
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
already have some affordability
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
component built into it so in other
 
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
words they might be using low income
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
housing tax credits or they might be
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
using some other
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
public funded program through new
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire housing finance authority
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
those types of affordability
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
commitments would already be in place
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
for these fun and then these funds would
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
assist sort of get us over the finish
 
01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.390 align:start position:0%
assist sort of get us over the finish
line

01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you paula
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead so you have any sense of
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
how many existing projects there are
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
currently that might be eligible
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
i don't have a good sense of that right
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
now i can only tell you that
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding my recollection is that
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
at least as it relates to projects that
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
are being administered by
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire housing finance
 
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
authority that there's around 1 500
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
units that are in construction process
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
now whether that's a regular churn
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
um it's hard for me to say right at this
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
point but it's i would say it's at least
 
01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
in that category
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
taking my questions
 
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
um as i understand it we had two choices
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
for how to use this money the first way
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
would be to follow hud guidelines and
 
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
that would have required
 
01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.229 align:start position:0%
that would have required
that

01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
the money be used to build affordable
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
housing for people whose incomes were up
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
to 300 percent of the federal
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
poverty level
 
01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:38.790 align:start position:0%
poverty level
or

01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
take to use it as revenue replacement
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
um in which there are no
 
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
income there's no requirement for
 
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
affordability standards so
 
01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:51.350 align:start position:0%
affordability standards so
um

01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
why we chose not to build
 
01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
affordable housing with these public
 
01:16:58.480 --> 01:16:59.669 align:start position:0%
affordable housing with these public
funds

01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:16:59.679 --> 01:17:01.030 align:start position:0%
funds
and

01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
and i i heard your previous answer that
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
some of the projects
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
that you think you'd be investing in
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
already have some income standards and
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
beyond that what are the specific
 
01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.950 align:start position:0%
beyond that what are the specific
rails

01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
rails
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
that gover will have
 
01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:20.630 align:start position:0%
that gover will have
to

01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
assure us that this money will be used
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
to support affordable housing
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
and not
 
01:17:33.630 --> 01:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
market rate housing and what specific
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
transparency measures will there be in
 
01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
thank you senator a couple of questions
 
01:17:40.719 --> 01:17:41.510 align:start position:0%
thank you senator a couple of questions
there

01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
you might have to help me work through
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
them all so
 
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
on on your first question on the
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
transparency issue this program would
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
run um no different from any other
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
program that either gopher or ba has
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
administered where
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
there will be a great deal of
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
transparency as to where the funds are
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
and where they are where they go and
 
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
what they're used for
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
that would not be any different for this
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
program than any of the others
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
with regard to the affordability piece i
 
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
think it's important and i i acknowledge
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
the issue here i i think it's important
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
to to
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
to understand that what we're trying to
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
do with this fund is to create a
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism where we can accelerate
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh the number of units that are coming
 
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
online in the state as i mentioned
 
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
earlier at a point six percent unemploy
 
01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:27.350 align:start position:0%
earlier at a point six percent unemploy
a

01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate across the state uh that
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
a healthy vacancy rate is somewhere
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
between three and five percent
 
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
um i think it's you know when we when we
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
how do we move those projects forward
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
quicker we're looking at projects
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
funding that comes late in the game
 
01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
funding that is
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
flexible enough to be able to fit a host
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
of different projects so for example i i
 
01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
had mentioned like the tax credit
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
programs that are out there if there's a
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
gap that this that is being seen at the
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
end of this project where they can't get
 
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh the project to move forward this
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
would be an opportunity for that project
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
to come forward get some additional
 
01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:08.390 align:start position:0%
to come forward get some additional
money

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
that would uh advance it um i think
 
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh to in to take
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
a situation where you already have
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
affordability commitments in place under
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
the rules and regulations the funding
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
that they're already getting under the
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
tax credit program and then layer that
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
on top of the subsidy that they're
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
already receiving either for the capital
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
for the operating cost
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
would not represent the most flexible
 
01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
way to be able to
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
so that's one i think the other piece is
 
01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.390 align:start position:0%
so that's one i think the other piece is
i

01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
and and we would see
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
a whole host of different types of
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
projects that would be coming
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
to this type of
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
program they would be as i mentioned the
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
affordable projects they would be
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
projects that have a zoning requirement
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
that might be enforced by a locality
 
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
like an inclusionary zoning requirement
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
they might be projects that have uh
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
mixed income within them so there's a
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
component that has an affordability
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
piece to it but then there's a market
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
rate component to that
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
um and they might be in a rural town
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
where you have um you know an old
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
victorian house that somebody's
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
converting into five six seven units
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
those are the types of projects that
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
would be eligible so trying to build a
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
program that allows us to get at all of
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
those different pieces
 
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
recognizing that the funds that we are
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
providing under this program are not in
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
and of themselves going to be the only
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
source of funding for any of these types
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
of projects
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh because the the cost of
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
of building these units far exceeds
 
01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
anything that's close to a three million
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
dollar cap
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a it is as we say a capital
 
01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
uh fund for f for gaps in these types of
 
01:20:53.679 --> 01:20:54.709 align:start position:0%
uh fund for f for gaps in these types of
programs

01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
so i would just fall back on the point
 
01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.350 align:start position:0%
so i would just fall back on the point
that

01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
this is designed to be as flexible as we
 
01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.030 align:start position:0%
this is designed to be as flexible as we
can

01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
recognizing that i believe that the vast
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
majority of the projects that we are
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
going to see and in fact i'd be i'm i'm
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
anticipating that the first several
 
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
rounds of this program would be um
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
would be held
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
exclusively for our non-profit
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
developers who are developing
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
exclusively those types of affordable
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
units and for smaller units smaller unit
 
01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.830 align:start position:0%
units and for smaller units smaller unit
projects

01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's the goal was the flexibility
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
component so i i hope i've
 
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
gotten at that a little bit
 
01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:33.199 --> 01:21:34.629 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:34.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
so of all the units that you believe
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
this money will help bring online
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
what percentage are you predicting will
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
meet that hud
 
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
guideline of
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh family income
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
up to 300 percent
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
i i i'm going to have to say it's
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
impossible for me to be able to say that
 
01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
right now center exactly how many units
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
of which type we're going to have under
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
each category but as i stated there are
 
01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
a number of considerations that any
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
developer is going to have to take into
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
account when they consider using these
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
types of funds
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
larger projects in particular are going
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
to fall within the realms of 2 cfr 200
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
where there are
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.669 --> 01:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
procurement and other types of programs
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
that then would uh be applicable to
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
their project as a result of you
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
utilizing this funding so i think that
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
there's probably going to be some degree
 
01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.390 align:start position:0%
there's probably going to be some degree
of

01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
self-selection that goes on
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh once this sits the actual marketplace
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
that we're looking to
 
01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.310 align:start position:0%
that we're looking to
influence

01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
influence
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
one final thank you
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
um are you aware that the disability
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
community has asked us to oppose this
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
project because
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
they don't believe it will
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
really result in affordable housing and
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
that people with disabilities are
 
01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:03.830 align:start position:0%
that people with disabilities are
disproportionately

01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
disproportionately
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
impacted by the lack of affordable
 
01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.310 align:start position:0%
impacted by the lack of affordable
housing

01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
well i'm i'm not aware of of that
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
madam uh senator but i would say again
 
01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:16.950 align:start position:0%
madam uh senator but i would say again
this

01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
program is not designed to in and of
 
01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:20.950 align:start position:0%
program is not designed to in and of
itself

01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
itself
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
be the sole source of funding for any
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
project that it is it is going to be an
 
01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.030 align:start position:0%
project that it is it is going to be an
addition

01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
addition
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
to multitude of other programs that are
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
already available and operating in the
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of affordable housing
 
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of housing for those
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
with melted illness those in an suv
 
01:23:40.159 --> 01:23:41.430 align:start position:0%
with melted illness those in an suv
situation

01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
or homelessness funding those programs
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
are all still in existence
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
i think as a whole
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
when we look at the fact that we're
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
according to again new hampshire housing
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
finance authority somewhere uh around 20
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
000 units short of what we would
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily need going forward for
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
housing in the state um we need to be
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
able to bring whatever resources we can
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
to bear on all of those types of
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
projects across the spectrum of the
 
01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:09.990 align:start position:0%
projects across the spectrum of the
needs

01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
are there further questions uh
 
01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.149 align:start position:0%
are there further questions uh
representative

01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
all me
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:24.149 --> 01:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
on i've been working in
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
housing in lebanon for
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
25 years now one of the thing with
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
bankers on mostly with bankers
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
on one of the things that we learned
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
through unfortunate experience
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
was that when we built
 
01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:44.629 align:start position:0%
was that when we built
for

01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
the approximately 10 above median income
 
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
in our area
 
01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:51.590 align:start position:0%
in our area
uh

01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
we ended up
 
01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.390 align:start position:0%
we ended up
on

01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.590 align:start position:0%
on
with

01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.830 align:start position:0%
with
housing

01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
helped our growing economy
 
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
but it was all for at least
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
10 percent above median income and it
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
left and
 
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
we were continuing to lose housing for
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
the people
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
below that level which is 60 of the
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
population and which also includes the
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
people that man our restaurants that man
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
our hospitals that uh on
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
everybody who is moving in
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
expected to be there
 
01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:34.070 align:start position:0%
expected to be there
and

01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
and every time we would build
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
at that level
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
we would see no impact on the 60 percent
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
and we would see
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
after a few months no impact because
 
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
on our economy is growing and in the
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
other parts of the state where the
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
seacoast particularly were just
 
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
just like a little piece of sea coast
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
you get that same kind of effect
 
01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.350 align:start position:0%
you get that same kind of effect
so

01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
what i'm
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
i'm really concerned with if there is
 
01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:12.229 align:start position:0%
i'm really concerned with if there is
any

01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh i'm concerned with there not being
 
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
any close tie with housing
 
01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire housing
 
01:26:20.239 --> 01:26:21.510 align:start position:0%
new hampshire housing
which

01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
was created to do this kind of thing i'm
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
not sure why that happened
 
01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:28.709 align:start position:0%
not sure why that happened
and

01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know specifically
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
for this capital grant program
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
could you make
 
01:26:35.679 --> 01:26:36.950 align:start position:0%
could you make
a

01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
a grant to a developer that was building
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
high income housing let's say five
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a unit rent
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
required to pay back his costs
 
01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.229 align:start position:0%
required to pay back his costs
on

01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:26:52.239 --> 01:26:53.270 align:start position:0%
on
under

01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you representative and
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
yes i completely agree with you there is
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
this is a situation where
 
01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:05.990 align:start position:0%
this is a situation where
um

01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an uphill battle in this
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
market right now to address availability
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
and affordability um whether it's
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
the national increase in housing costs
 
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's the supply chain challenges
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
that we're uh seeing
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
it is an all hands on deck type of
 
01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:24.310 align:start position:0%
it is an all hands on deck type of
situation

01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
and i think uh to your account i mean
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
the upper valley has got
 
01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
a number of businesses that are that are
 
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
coming together to form a loan fund
 
01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
for this very purpose um and to be able
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
to make investments in these types of
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
projects to address the issue that
 
01:27:42.149 --> 01:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
you're talking about i will say that new
 
01:27:44.229 --> 01:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire housing finance authority has
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
been very much part of the discussion um
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
in the development of this program
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
and in fact um under the 60 million
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
that is reserved for the individual
 
01:27:54.239 --> 01:27:56.310 align:start position:0%
that is reserved for the individual
project

01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:57.270 align:start position:0%
project
funding

01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
50 million of it would be for this
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
particular program and 10 million of
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
those funds would go to new hampshire
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
housing finance authority to
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
implant into their existing programs
 
01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:06.629 align:start position:0%
implant into their existing programs
like

01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
um whether it's a home program or it's
 
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing fund or whatever
 
01:28:13.110 --> 01:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
the case might be so it is absolutely
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
all hands on deck type of situation
 
01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:18.390 align:start position:0%
all hands on deck type of situation
follow-up

01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
yes with a question thank you yes uh but
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
the 50 million would uh could go
 
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.590 align:start position:0%
the 50 million would uh could go
to

01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
topping off for the developers that are
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
building the highest level of rental
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
housing in the state
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
i've been pretty clear we we have a very
 
01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:39.350 align:start position:0%
i've been pretty clear we we have a very
strong

01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
strong
 
01:28:41.189 --> 01:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
um and we will have a very strong
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
preference for what we refer to
 
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
generically as workforce housing
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
and again i'm trying to
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
walk a line here to be able to
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
build a program that has the flexibility
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
to address
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
a multitude of different needs
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
across the state and while you know
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
there might be
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
um extremely high uh costs in a
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
community like lebanon uh there may be
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
other more rural communities that um
 
01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:09.750 align:start position:0%
other more rural communities that um
that

01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
that where sort of those types of income
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
restrictions might
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
might not be what they're looking to be
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
able to uh make an investment in so
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh i will i will continue to say though
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
that the projects that typically have
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
these gaps are the projects that will
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
already have affordability commitments
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
built into them
 
01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:29.669 align:start position:0%
built into them
and

01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
that is the real goal of the program
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you it and the um i
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
i find it interesting where we're going
 
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
right here because this the uh
 
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
in the budget we certainly continued
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
with making sure that you got the 5
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
million a year to construct constructing
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we put a lot more money
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
into construction in new hampshire and
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
this hundred million
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
which i i think it's great that we chose
 
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
to use that part of opera money um where
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
we don't have the strings
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
attached from the federal government
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
because one of the things that i see was
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
picked up here and i certainly fought
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
for it is the fact that we're going to
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
work with communities that will get
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
applications through in six months
 
01:30:21.669 --> 01:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
because isn't that the plan that we want
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
these to start to happen in a way
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
instead of fighting our local
 
01:30:26.159 --> 01:30:27.669 align:start position:0%
instead of fighting our local
communities

01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
now we're proposing let's work with them
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
i think that's the way to do this i mean
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
we certainly have communities that don't
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
want to work with us on developing we're
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
basically saying to the communities that
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
do want to work with us team up with
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
developers locally and let's get started
 
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
i think the interesting part is that
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to start with non-profits
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
and you're going to
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
do that for the first couple of rounds
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
applications my only concern is we're
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
appropriating 100 million dollars right
 
01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.629 align:start position:0%
appropriating 100 million dollars right
now

01:30:58.629 --> 01:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
and what i'm hearing and this i'm just
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
trying to find out because you did this
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
with gopher you had to reallocate
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
several times because the money didn't
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
get spent under the time period that it
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
had to be
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned that just the calls
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
i'm getting on transformers
 
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
you know in the state of new hampshire
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
are stopping development today
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
i mean 60 weeks for someone that's
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
permitted and ready to make the purchase
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
for the transformers that's how long
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's going to take for them to work with
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
the electric company either of the two
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
big ones that i've talked to so far
 
01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:38.229 align:start position:0%
big ones that i've talked to so far
and

01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that the 2026 deadline is
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
gonna at some point be affected and this
 
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
is a lot of money yeah is there some
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
point where you're going to start to
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
make decisions
 
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
to come back and talk about shifting
 
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
this yeah um yes all good point center i
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
think um you know without question
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned earlier developing any
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
type of housing right now in new
 
01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire is an uphill battle for many
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that you've described
 
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's transformers whether it's
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
refrigerators whether it's all wood
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
products whatever the building
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
construction needs are
 
01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
in addition to the sometimes
 
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
inability to find those products there's
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
also a cost component and again that's
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
the type of thing that we're looking to
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
impart be able to address to move these
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
projects forward to the extent that the
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
funding is available with regard to your
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
other question
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah i think i mentioned earlier that
 
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
we are having a deadline of the program
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
deadline would be the
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
in a year so june of 2023 so well before
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
our obligation deadline of 2024
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh that gives us both the opportunity to
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
work with projects um in order to um you
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
know identify and to accommodate for any
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
of the types of things that you're
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
describing but also gives us an
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see where the funding is
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
at that point and then make any
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
decisions that we would need to from
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
there this is as you'll as you know
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
an accept and expend request so
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that we are going to
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
actually that we will spend all 100
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
million but i have every expectation uh
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
given the state of the marketplace in
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire right now that we are
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
going to get as close to that as we
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
possibly can
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you have that expectation yes
 
01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.229 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you have that expectation yes
sir

01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
sir
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
i think on this committee we all have
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
things that constituents are asking for
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
us to fund right about now you mentioned
 
01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
1500 units in the pipeline one of the
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
things that came up earlier in
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
discussing this
 
01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:37.669 align:start position:0%
discussing this
was

01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
the dates where developers could use
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
this money if they're already in the
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
permitting process
 
01:33:46.629 --> 01:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
and have been through planning board can
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
they get involved in this program yes
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
okay and does that have a look back
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
period to any point in time well we
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
would at this point uh what we would do
 
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
is probably have for the main program uh
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
the date of the governor's state of the
 
01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
state address february 18th i believe
 
01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
that was that the permits would have to
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
be applied for after that point
 
01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:10.149 align:start position:0%
be applied for after that point
okay

01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
and and and just something
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a question
 
01:34:14.719 --> 01:34:16.070 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a question
um

01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
not a chairwoman but
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
i think the public
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
the communities have to look at this
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
in a way that can tie to a lot of things
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
that are going on in the state but this
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars per unit
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
um that a municipality can get if
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
they're bringing units into their
 
01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:36.790 align:start position:0%
they're bringing units into their
communities

01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
would be a great start to tying to all
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
these water projects that we're doing in
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
this state
 
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
because we're at this point trying to
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
tie together about a third coming from
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
the communities and the other two thirds
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
this is a great opportunity
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
as developers are working with
 
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
communities to cooperate and when
 
01:34:59.910 --> 01:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
communities are saying we can't come up
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
with the money um you know 50 units
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
brings you 500 000
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
um that's 150 000 a project that you
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
could tie into so i see that it could be
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
a plus here but i i guess what i'd be
 
01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:15.189 align:start position:0%
a plus here but i i guess what i'd be
asking

01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
asking
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
um and this is my final question is it
 
01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
possible on that june 23rd
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
that you report back to this committee
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
where we are with the money because i do
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
think there's places that could be
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
shifted to that could react quicker
 
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
certainly and i'd be willing to do it
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
even prior to that you know as we as i'm
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
a kind of a regular here these days i'd
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
be happy to give you updates as we go
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
through the program um and once it
 
01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:41.030 align:start position:0%
through the program um and once it
initiates

01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
initiates
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
are there
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
who's going to administer this if i if i
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
know a developer that might be
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
interested where where did that
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
developer go to knock on the door and
 
01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:01.510 align:start position:0%
developer go to knock on the door and
say

01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
i'm interested the administration
 
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
program will happen at the department of
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
business and economic affairs
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
but any of our partners that we work
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
with in the housing space are going to
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
be part of the
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
the day-to-day operation of the program
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
like the new hampshire housing authority
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
yes sir okay thank you
 
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.189 align:start position:0%
yes sir okay thank you
representative

01:36:23.189 --> 01:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro thank you madam
 
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
chairman just two questions uh taylor
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
taylor how do you address the concerns
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
of the disability community that they're
 
01:36:45.189 --> 01:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
going to be they're not going to be
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
positively affected by this i think
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's a concern how do you
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
address that and secondly the
 
01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities receiving uh 40 million
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
don't you think that that there's some
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
concern from the municipalities that
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
this split
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
is not fair for them that they could do
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
a better job if you
 
01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:04.310 align:start position:0%
a better job if you
uh

01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
allocated more of your resources in
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
their direct in their direction so the
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
disabled situation and the way you
 
01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
allocated the funds those two questions
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
please yes sir so on the municipal
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
component uh you know again these are
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
funds that are designed as senator morse
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
pointed out to help
 
01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
incentivize communities that want to
 
01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:26.390 align:start position:0%
incentivize communities that want to
participate

01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
participate
 
01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:27.669 align:start position:0%
participate
in

01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
some level of development in their
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
community to
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
to receive funding that may be
 
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
the funds
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
the new project might impact the
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
community in some way they might want to
 
01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
use those funds to put the the funding
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
back into the project whether it's for
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure whatever the case might
 
01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:45.990 align:start position:0%
infrastructure whatever the case might
be

01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
and it is really aimed at the issue that
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
we have which is
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
we could um have all of this money but
 
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
if we don't have any communities that
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
are willing to um you know use their
 
01:37:58.950 --> 01:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
zoning laws or
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
participate in the us in building
 
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
communities and helping their local
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
economies um there's no no way we can
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
spend that resource and so it's a
 
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
necessary component here so whether it's
 
01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
the per unit piece or whether it's
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
helping them um review and plan for
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
their zoning regulations
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
or the demolition component
 
01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
i think that that is a
 
01:38:23.189 --> 01:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
a worthy investment in an overall
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
strategy to try to again accelerate with
 
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
one-time money within within a very
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
specific window of time
 
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh the maximum number of units that we
 
01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:33.669 align:start position:0%
uh the maximum number of units that we
can

01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
further question
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
well the
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
people are going to gravitate to the
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
urban areas and that's where
 
01:38:40.159 --> 01:38:41.030 align:start position:0%
urban areas and that's where
the

01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
rehab could take place i mean i i see
 
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
many uh buildings in the area that i
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
represent with the with the uh the red
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
cross uh
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
which calls for demolition and that
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's i think the reason why
 
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities think that they should
 
01:38:56.239 --> 01:38:57.270 align:start position:0%
municipalities think that they should
get

01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:00.159 align:start position:0%
more uh more money available to them and
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh that that's going to be a a a key
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
issue all the way around
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
the the vacancy rate obviously is the
 
01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:09.910 align:start position:0%
the the vacancy rate obviously is the
minimus

01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
minimus
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
so the the deed the deed has manifested
 
01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
itself and so
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
but there's the second question i think
 
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
the disability situation we have
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
disability housing in manchester in uh
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
in years it's been it's been run by
 
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
crotchet mountain
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh and uh there's a definite need uh for
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
disability housing and how's that going
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
to be affected by this this plan that
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
you have in place and the municipalities
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
obviously would be the place where
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
disability housing would be most
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
effective because of the abilities that
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
are available to disabled
 
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
yes sir again i think
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
the the way to think of this program is
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
that it is one that is another tool in
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
the toolbox for people that are
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
developing housing of all types in the
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire there are other
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
types of funding that are continue to be
 
01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:59.109 align:start position:0%
types of funding that are continue to be
available

01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
for a multitude of different programs
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
through new hampshire housing or cdfa or
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
others i would hope that by continuing
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
to address the overall vacancy rate
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
program problem and the supply of
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
housing in the state that that will have
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
a ripple effect across
 
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative almi
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
thank you i i've got two questions one
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
of them is are you absolutely sure we
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
can meet the revenue replacement
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
criterion when the federal government
 
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
starts auditing yes ma'am
 
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
100 percent okay
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
on and the other one
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
is when we
 
01:40:43.199 --> 01:40:44.629 align:start position:0%
is when we
uh

01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
does the per unit grant program
 
01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh also have this restriction that the
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
permit has to have been asked for in
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
february 22 which
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
or later which would mean that
 
01:40:59.199 --> 01:41:00.470 align:start position:0%
or later which would mean that
they

01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
can't possibly get anything out of this
 
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh start
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
start on
 
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
working on the project until september
 
01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:13.510 align:start position:0%
working on the project until september
um

01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
my initial action is that it would be
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
but i i
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
your point is well taken we'll have when
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
we get to the point of
 
01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
sort of doing the final rules on this
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
i'll take a a second look at that man
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
but you you make a good point yeah i'd
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
i'd like to uh mention
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
on we have a 400
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
unit permitted building that is supposed
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
to provide housing for the people mostly
 
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
that are going to be
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
on hired anew by uh dartmouth hitchcock
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
now hitchcock health or
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
dartmouth health uh
 
01:41:53.189 --> 01:41:53.199 align:start position:0%
and on if
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
and that is stalled at this point and
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
they're being very close-mouthed about
 
01:41:59.590 --> 01:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
it but originally they said it was
 
01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:00.470 align:start position:0%
it but originally they said it was
because

01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
they could not get a contractor to start
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
working for four years to come which
 
01:42:07.590 --> 01:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
means they're dumping
 
01:42:11.669 --> 01:42:11.679 align:start position:0%
400 people into our housing market all
 
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
at once
 
01:42:15.270 --> 01:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
and uh they're trying to do something
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
about it but
 
01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:17.430 align:start position:0%
about it but
on

01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:18.470 align:start position:0%
on
if

01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
on i believe
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm personally interested
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
in this so that lebanon doesn't end up
 
01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:33.030 align:start position:0%
in this so that lebanon doesn't end up
losing

01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
losing
 
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
every house we had that people could
 
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
live in that were under
 
01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
mark uh
 
01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
senator morris yeah i just want to point
 
01:42:47.109 --> 01:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
out that
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
the thought of starting a program like
 
01:42:49.679 --> 01:42:50.629 align:start position:0%
the thought of starting a program like
this

01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
when we started talking to the governor
 
01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
was because of dartmouth
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
senator hood who's over there was the
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
first person i called because i saw a
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
business teaming up with a developer
 
01:43:07.590 --> 01:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
and that's where this concept started to
 
01:43:09.669 --> 01:43:09.679 align:start position:0%
evolve and then the governor took it a
 
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
hundred miles further but um that's what
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
this was all about trying to get people
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
to get creative in this state and i
 
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
think they've done a good job i think
 
01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:20.719 align:start position:0%
this needs more work like anything else
 
01:43:20.719 --> 01:43:21.510 align:start position:0%
this needs more work like anything else
but

01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
and i can assure you on the revenue side
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
there's probably double that number
 
01:43:28.629 --> 01:43:28.639 align:start position:0%
available in new hampshire
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
 
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair we've been talking
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
about affordable
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
housing but a few minutes ago you said
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
it was your intention that
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
we use this money to invest in workforce
 
01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:47.750 align:start position:0%
we use this money to invest in workforce
housing

01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
those two things are different
 
01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire law so
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
what is this
 
01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719 align:start position:0%
what is the commitment of this fund to
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
affordable housing which is the issue
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
being raised by the disability community
 
01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.310 align:start position:0%
being raised by the disability community
versus

01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
workforce housing which speaks to a
 
01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
higher income level
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
um well as you know senator the
 
01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
linguistics of affordable workforce
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
housing are um are constantly in motion
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
um again i the the program that we're
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
that we're proposing today would be able
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
to invest in uh programs that have
 
01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
affordability requirements in place now
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
those requirements
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
take a different form depending on the
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
program that is used is being used to
 
01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
fund the
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
the the project so again if we were
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
using low-income housing tax credit
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
program that would have a different
 
01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
affordability requirement or commitment
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
built into it than a program that might
 
01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
use the community development block
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
grant program so
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
while we're not necessarily stating a
 
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
specific level
 
01:44:59.590 --> 01:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh that you know you have to meet this
 
01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:00.629 align:start position:0%
uh that you know you have to meet this
particular

01:45:00.629 --> 01:45:00.639 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:45:02.310 --> 01:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
threshold in order to be funded to the
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
program what we're saying is that we
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
want to be able to invest in all of
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
those types of programs and not
 
01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:09.669 align:start position:0%
those types of programs and not
necessarily

01:45:09.669 --> 01:45:09.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:45:12.629 --> 01:45:12.639 align:start position:0%
change the subs the underlying subsidy
 
01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
requirements that are in place for any
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
particular project so again it's the
 
01:45:19.590 --> 01:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
flexibility piece this being a separate
 
01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:20.470 align:start position:0%
flexibility piece this being a separate
tool

01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
tool
 
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
not the exclusive tool that is important
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.870 --> 01:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
i know you've talked about
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
getting the rules getting the program
 
01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
established when do you think that's
 
01:45:41.109 --> 01:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
well our goal right now is to have this
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
program be available by june of this
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
year okay so that means you'll have
 
01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:49.830 align:start position:0%
year okay so that means you'll have
whatever

01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
people need to know about it to apply
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
yes it may yeah okay so we're looking at
 
01:45:56.239 --> 01:45:57.189 align:start position:0%
yes it may yeah okay so we're looking at
june

01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
june
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
yeah i am i'm writing it down okay
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
there's a a lot of i'll tell you there's
 
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of interest in this program from
 
01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
people that i have heard from and uh
 
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
that's been one of the major questions
 
01:46:17.199 --> 01:46:18.310 align:start position:0%
that's been one of the major questions
so

01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:20.629 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
could i have a motion to accept move the
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%

madam chair yes
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
it sounded like you're asking for
 
01:47:33.189 --> 01:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
something to be written and delivered to
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
us in june
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
could could we ask that they uh include
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
a section on what we're going to do to
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
make sure there's a full and open uh
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
competition for these grants and and i
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with 100 million
 
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
dollars just uh curious to i'm just
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
interested in making sure that this is a
 
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
fair process and not a favored process
 
01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:57.270 align:start position:0%
fair process and not a favored process
so

01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:59.830 align:start position:0%
so
okay

01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
no problem right
 
01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:04.719 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
01:48:04.719 --> 01:48:05.830 align:start position:0%
okay so um
we'll

01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
see what happens in june
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
okay now we move on to
 
01:48:10.639 --> 01:48:14.470 align:start position:0%
okay now we move on to
fis22151

01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
actually could we take a five minute
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:16.070 --> 01:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
oh tab
 
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:39.430 --> 01:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:42.709 --> 01:56:42.719 align:start position:0%
my only question is where are you going
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
to find these 21 people
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
i know that mr arlinghaus will
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
come to grips with that for us in a
 
01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:59.350 align:start position:0%
little bit
so

01:56:59.350 --> 01:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:00.639 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
so seven of
 
01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
only seven of the positions will not be
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
filled with existing hampstead employees
 
01:57:09.030 --> 01:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
so all of the rest of the 21 will be
 
01:57:11.189 --> 01:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
filled with existing employees of
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
hampstead hospital
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
so we only need to recruit for seven and
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh i agree i
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
expect that we'll be working with
 
01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
administrative services trying to fill
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
those positions i also think there are
 
01:57:23.910 --> 01:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
some advantages to the positions being
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the southern tier of the state it
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
does draw a different population than
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:32.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
okay i i have one other question
 
01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:43.350 align:start position:0%
okay i i have one other question
um

01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:44.229 align:start position:0%
um
what

01:57:44.229 --> 01:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
are you anticipating the effect on the
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
budget will be in
 
01:57:49.679 --> 01:57:53.109 align:start position:0%
budget will be in
2425

01:57:53.109 --> 01:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
sure and i forgot to state my name again
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
for the record karen lucas chief
 
01:57:58.629 --> 01:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
financial officer hhs
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:58:04.629 --> 01:58:04.639 align:start position:0%
the effect on the on the 2425 budget is
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
still being determined
 
01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
so if it was based solely on this item
 
01:58:12.070 --> 01:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
then i would say that the request would
 
01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
be for nine million dollars a year in
 
01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
general funds but what we don't know
 
01:58:17.189 --> 01:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
because we're not operating the facility
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
yet is what the actual revenues will be
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
so what will class
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
revenue class 009 look like when we're
 
01:58:26.709 --> 01:58:26.719 align:start position:0%
actually operating the budget and i
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
think fortunately
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
we will have a little time it probably
 
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
won't be until the house or potentially
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
even the senate phase before we have a
 
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
better idea
 
01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
so it the agency budget probably will
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
look a lot like this
 
01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
but the uh we'll be able to adjust that
 
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
in later phases as we get a better sense
 
01:58:48.149 --> 01:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
of what the revenue actually is the
 
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
other thing i just want to mention about
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
this fiscal item is this is a 12 month
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal item with the exception of one
 
01:58:57.189 --> 01:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
class line class line 12 which is
 
01:58:59.589 --> 01:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
half of the anticipated budget because
 
01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
those positions are budgeted in the
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
purchase item that we came with a couple
 
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
weeks ago the other reason i wanted to
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
mention that this is a 12-month budget
 
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
is that the department may be back with
 
01:59:11.109 --> 01:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
an additional item
 
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
if the the close happens uh prior to 6
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
30. we the reason that we are doing it
 
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:18.639 align:start position:0%
this way is one we wanted to get an item
 
01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
forward to you because we need to bring
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
a contract forward for the contractor as
 
01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
soon as possible and two
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
we wanted the picture to be 12 months so
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
we may see a smaller item come back from
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
the department um a little later okay

would you please introduce yourselves
 
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chair my name is
 
02:13:04.709 --> 02:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
michelle lebron i'm the chair of the
 
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
board of tax and land appeals
 
02:13:09.750 --> 02:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is ann stellmack
 
02:13:10.950 --> 02:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
i'm the clerk of the board of tax and
 
02:13:12.550 --> 02:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
land appeals
 
02:13:16.709 --> 02:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
02:13:18.629 --> 02:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
uh represent edwards
 
02:13:21.030 --> 02:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um
 
02:13:24.069 --> 02:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
so so this looks like it's uh an attempt
 
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and
 
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
contract out a review appraiser rather
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
than using in-house talent
 
02:13:33.109 --> 02:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
that's the way i read it but is that is
 
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
that accurate and what's going to be the
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
net effect of this year over year
 
02:13:41.830 --> 02:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's somewhat accurate
 
02:13:44.550 --> 02:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
we've had a vacancy in that position for
 
02:13:47.189 --> 02:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
over a year now and have not been able
 
02:13:48.550 --> 02:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
to fill it
 
02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
so it's an attempt to try
 
02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
and get some qualified people through
 
02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:55.669 align:start position:0%
and get some qualified people through
contracts

02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
to do some of the role that role said
 
02:14:01.270 --> 02:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
are necessary for the board to function
 
02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:04.629 align:start position:0%
are necessary for the board to function
um

02:14:04.629 --> 02:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:08.950 --> 02:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:11.830 --> 02:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
represent army
 
02:14:15.430 --> 02:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
you madam chair on i know we've got a
 
02:14:18.149 --> 02:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
major shortage of qualified assessors in
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
this state now
 
02:14:23.189 --> 02:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
and it's getting worse and
 
02:14:25.270 --> 02:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
are you going to have to contract from
 
02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
out of state from people that
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know our systems
 
02:14:32.950 --> 02:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
we are hoping that we will not have to
 
02:14:34.709 --> 02:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
because we we think they should be
 
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
qualified and know this state in order
 
02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:38.069 align:start position:0%
qualified and know this state in order
to

02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
function in the in the way that they
 
02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:42.229 align:start position:0%
function in the in the way that they
should

02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
should
 
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:48.149 --> 02:14:48.159 align:start position:0%

is we're either going to be forced to
 
02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of money on basically
 
02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
sewer treatment plants to attach to
 
02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
these hatcheries at some point
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
the other option came up as a change of
 
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
management technique so right now most
 
02:19:34.629 --> 02:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
of our hatcheries are run with uh you've
 
02:19:36.549 --> 02:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
probably seen them raceways or flat
 
02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
bottom tanks
 
02:19:41.349 --> 02:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
so the a newer methodology are actually
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
they're they're a round tank they look
 
02:19:45.190 --> 02:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
like our round tanks but they have a
 
02:19:47.669 --> 02:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
cone at the bottom the water goes in at
 
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
an angle creating a certifical force in
 
02:19:51.990 --> 02:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
the water
 
02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
and that forces all of the solids to the
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:59.429 --> 02:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
it's a lot cheaper for us to remove
 
02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
phosphorus while it's
 
02:20:04.150 --> 02:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
whether it be spent feed or fish feces
 
02:20:06.309 --> 02:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
than it is once that phosphorus starts
 
02:20:07.750 --> 02:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
breaking down
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
and then it's a chemical that we have to
 
02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:12.230 align:start position:0%
and then it's a chemical that we have to
remove

02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
remove
 
02:20:14.230 --> 02:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
so as we looked at the problems we're
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
having environmentally it became obvious
 
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
that it would behoove us to upgrade our
 
02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
hatcheries that we have
 
02:20:22.309 --> 02:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
the condition of the hatcheries that
 
02:20:25.590 --> 02:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
report that we sent around on on the
 
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
report we gave the governor on the
 
02:20:28.630 --> 02:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
hatcheries you will see
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
their hatcheries are old the newest one
 
02:20:32.230 --> 02:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
we have is at milford it's about 50
 
02:20:35.349 --> 02:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
years old uh our next one is 75 the next
 
02:20:37.349 --> 02:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
one is 90 and then we have three over
 
02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
100 years old
 
02:20:41.190 --> 02:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
and through time you know we've we've
 
02:20:42.630 --> 02:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
done maintenance
 
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
but we probably haven't kept up at to
 
02:20:46.469 --> 02:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
the level that we needed to to keep
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
these things going indefinitely and it
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
is time to you know between the issue of
 
02:20:52.950 --> 02:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
the maintenance and the issue of trying
 
02:20:55.110 --> 02:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
to improve the environmental footprint
 
02:20:57.030 --> 02:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
of the hatcheries and reduce the
 
02:20:58.870 --> 02:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
the phosphorus that we're releasing into
 
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
the streams
 
02:21:05.349 --> 02:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:07.270 --> 02:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any
 
02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up just just
 
02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:10.309 align:start position:0%
follow-up just just
it

02:21:10.309 --> 02:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:21:12.150 --> 02:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
we talked about it we're talking about
 
02:21:13.990 --> 02:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
an investment but we can't
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
or can we we can't save all of them can
 
02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:17.510 align:start position:0%
or can we we can't save all of them can
we

02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:21:17.520 --> 02:21:18.870 align:start position:0%
we
um

02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
it would be expensive we are we're we
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
are doing a study right now the entire
 
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
system um and we will be looking at
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
whether we can condense our operations
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
down i think we can
 
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
but we're not going to be making any
 
02:21:37.349 --> 02:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
decisions until we finish up that study
 
02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
as far as what the total number exactly
 
02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
where they'll be what we'll start with
 
02:21:43.590 --> 02:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
these construction projects are the
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
hatcheries that we know we're going to
 
02:21:47.190 --> 02:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
be continuing with and that we can get
 
02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
done as you're all well aware the two
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
issues the the the the two stumbling
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
blocks or pinch points that we have with
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
opera you know we have to have the the
 
02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
funds in place by the end of 24 and we
 
02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
have to have them spent by the end of
 
02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:01.429 align:start position:0%
have to have them spent by the end of
26.

02:22:01.429 --> 02:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
26.
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
and we just felt that by the time we got
 
02:22:05.190 --> 02:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
done the entire study we would not be
 
02:22:07.349 --> 02:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
able to you know complete the project by
 
02:22:09.190 --> 02:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
the end of 26th so we're going to try to
 
02:22:11.590 --> 02:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
move ahead uh with two of our hatcheries
 
02:22:13.590 --> 02:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
and then we will come back probably
 
02:22:16.469 --> 02:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
before capital budget
 
02:22:19.030 --> 02:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up yes so
 
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
what effect will that have would stocky
 
02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh as the goal is
 
02:22:27.030 --> 02:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
is to hopefully maintain
 
02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:28.230 align:start position:0%
is to hopefully maintain
um

02:22:28.230 --> 02:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
production throughout um construction
 
02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:33.349 align:start position:0%
production throughout um construction
um

02:22:33.349 --> 02:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
we may get in a pinch where we're to
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
have to cut back temporarily during you
 
02:22:39.349 --> 02:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
know during construction but
 
02:22:39.359 --> 02:22:41.030 align:start position:0%
know during construction but
um

02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:42.550 --> 02:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
most of our hatcheries actually have
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of land so the concept that
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
we're trying to trying to look at is can
 
02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
we set over and build a new facility
 
02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
while the old facility's still being run
 
02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:22:56.150 --> 02:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know turn the water on to the new
 
02:22:58.150 --> 02:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
facility and when it's time for the you
 
02:23:01.750 --> 02:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:05.270 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
questions

02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%

okay we now move to the informational
 
02:23:57.190 --> 02:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
items are there any questions
 
02:23:59.510 --> 02:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
on any of
 
02:24:03.190 --> 02:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none
 
02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:11.429 --> 02:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
call up health and human services who's
 
02:24:13.030 --> 02:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
give us a little bit of an update on
 
02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:18.389 align:start position:0%
give us a little bit of an update on
arpa

02:24:18.389 --> 02:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
arpa
 
02:24:20.710 --> 02:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
and you have
 
02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
at your seat
 
02:24:25.510 --> 02:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
a sheet that looks a sheet that looks
 
02:24:33.270 --> 02:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:35.349 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:24:35.349 --> 02:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:24:35.359 --> 02:24:37.510 align:start position:0%
yeah
great

02:24:37.510 --> 02:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
first of all thank you i certainly
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate all of the kind words um and
 
02:24:44.309 --> 02:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
i probably can't say much more than that
 
02:24:46.150 --> 02:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
without tears coming so i'm just gonna
 
02:24:48.070 --> 02:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
stick with that so thank you it's only
 
02:24:49.250 --> 02:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
because you changed your name
 
02:24:49.260 --> 02:24:51.510 align:start position:0%
because you changed your name
[Laughter]

02:24:51.510 --> 02:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:24:52.790 --> 02:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
you know just creating a little
 
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
confusion um
 
02:24:57.429 --> 02:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
alessandro would tell you that that's
 
02:24:58.870 --> 02:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
just part of what i do create a little
 
02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
bit of confusion uh
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
so this document that i provided i know
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
the chair asked for a presentation and
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
this is not a presentation per se and i
 
02:25:10.469 --> 02:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
want to explain
 
02:25:13.270 --> 02:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
why and then talk about um how i'd like
 
02:25:14.870 --> 02:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
to move forward with it or how the
 
02:25:17.349 --> 02:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
department will move forward with it
 
02:25:17.359 --> 02:25:18.550 align:start position:0%
department will move forward with it
um

02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:23.110 --> 02:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
we have about 75 plus grants that have
 
02:25:25.190 --> 02:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
come to the department directly in arpa
 
02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
funding that are not through a gopher
 
02:25:31.270 --> 02:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
so none of what is reported here are
 
02:25:34.550 --> 02:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
grants that came through gopher
 
02:25:36.710 --> 02:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
as you all know i don't like to reinvent
 
02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
the wheels so what i did is we started
 
02:25:41.990 --> 02:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
with uh the document that the lba has
 
02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
created for all funds that have been
 
02:25:47.429 --> 02:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
accepted either through the governor's
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
emergency powers or through your
 
02:25:49.359 --> 02:25:50.710 align:start position:0%
emergency powers or through your
committee

02:25:50.710 --> 02:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:51.590 align:start position:0%
committee
and

02:25:51.590 --> 02:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:25:53.670 --> 02:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
a governor governor and council asked
 
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
for an update on spending about a month
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
and a half ago
 
02:26:01.270 --> 02:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
um and so we took the lba's document and
 
02:26:03.590 --> 02:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
added a spending column and that is what
 
02:26:05.190 --> 02:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
we provided to governor and council
 
02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
you'll note that the date on this is as
 
02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
of january 13th and that is why because
 
02:26:11.910 --> 02:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
i used that same document i provided to
 
02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
governor and council
 
02:26:15.910 --> 02:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
what i did for your committee is then
 
02:26:17.670 --> 02:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
also have
 
02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
my staff add a fiscal narrative column
 
02:26:21.990 --> 02:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
to go through
 
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
what each of them are and
 
02:26:26.630 --> 02:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
then you'll be get a sense of what the
 
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
spending has been on
 
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
and i think what makes the most sense is
 
02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:32.550 align:start position:0%
and i think what makes the most sense is
to

02:26:32.550 --> 02:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
give you all some time to digest this i
 
02:26:35.990 --> 02:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
know that this was just given to you
 
02:26:38.150 --> 02:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
this morning and then
 
02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
ask the department to present on um
 
02:26:44.230 --> 02:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
grants of interest things that you're
 
02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
interested in understanding better what
 
02:26:48.230 --> 02:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
the money was spent on or what it will
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
be spent on
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
just one caveat the expended column is
 
02:26:54.790 --> 02:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
truly expended so if it's been
 
02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
encumbered meaning that there is a
 
02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
contract already in place that governor
 
02:27:00.150 --> 02:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
and council is approved for spending
 
02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
those funds that is not represented in
 
02:27:04.150 --> 02:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
that column it is only if we've paid the
 
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
vendor so you may see a couple that you
 
02:27:07.590 --> 02:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
read the description you say why they've
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
not spent that money it's likely just we
 
02:27:11.429 --> 02:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
have not been billed yet by the vendor
 
02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
um so that is just something to keep in
 
02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:15.510 align:start position:0%
um so that is just something to keep in
mind

02:27:15.510 --> 02:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
mind
 
02:27:17.590 --> 02:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
but that uh that was how i decided to
 
02:27:20.389 --> 02:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
approach it rather than creating a 75
 
02:27:22.550 --> 02:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
slide powerpoint and sitting here for an
 
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
hour and a half walking you through each
 
02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
of them and having each director come up
 
02:27:28.630 --> 02:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
i thought you might appreciate having um
 
02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know a more um
 
02:27:34.309 --> 02:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
a more succinct approach to the things
 
02:27:39.910 --> 02:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
02:27:45.750 --> 02:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
so um so you're right i've i've i've not
 
02:27:48.150 --> 02:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
digested this document yet but so i'll
 
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
just ask my standard question which is
 
02:27:53.750 --> 02:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
is there a summary of all of the
 
02:27:56.710 --> 02:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
disparate it requests so that we
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
understand just in a kind of a nutshell
 
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
all the moving parts under the i.t
 
02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:03.750 align:start position:0%
all the moving parts under the i.t
upgrades

02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
upgrades
 
02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
so i that is was not specifically called
 
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
out on this document if that's something
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
you're interested in that is something
 
02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
we can prepare for you and tell you
 
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
which of these grants uh are being used
 
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
for it projects
 
02:28:18.790 --> 02:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
well and it's not just that the full
 
02:28:21.349 --> 02:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
grant is being used for an i.t project
 
02:28:24.630 --> 02:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
as i recall a few of them uh the it was
 
02:28:28.469 --> 02:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
embedded within a grant and so um so the
 
02:28:30.870 --> 02:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
idea of of tracking it gets to be a
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more complicated because it's
 
02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:33.510 align:start position:0%
little bit more complicated because it's
not

02:28:33.510 --> 02:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
at the top level it's buried within so
 
02:28:39.030 --> 02:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
so just just so that i'm consistent i'm
 
02:28:40.469 --> 02:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say that i've been
 
02:28:40.479 --> 02:28:41.990 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say that i've been
concerned

02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
that on the good side of things you now
 
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
have money to do all the i.t refresh
 
02:28:50.230 --> 02:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
that we know of but i just am concerned
 
02:28:53.590 --> 02:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
that we're not able to have visibility
 
02:28:57.030 --> 02:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
into them as a set of i.t projects
 
02:28:58.710 --> 02:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:29:00.309 --> 02:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
so i don't know how to form that in a
 
02:29:02.710 --> 02:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
request other than to continue to say i
 
02:29:04.630 --> 02:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
at some point i i would really like to
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
see what the i.t portfolio looks like
 
02:29:09.990 --> 02:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
i think in in the interest of my
 
02:29:11.429 --> 02:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
favorite term not in reinventing the
 
02:29:12.870 --> 02:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
wheel you had suggested that you were
 
02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
going to bring a request forward to the
 
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
health and human services committee
 
02:29:17.910 --> 02:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
which uh
 
02:29:19.510 --> 02:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
director weeders attends on a regular
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
basis and so that's probably the better
 
02:29:23.910 --> 02:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
venue for that question and getting that
 
02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
information sort of wholesale rather
 
02:29:27.990 --> 02:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
than piecing out what's in these arpa
 
02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
grants and then you want to know the
 
02:29:31.349 --> 02:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
bigger picture um because i think that
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
would create some double work for us i i
 
02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
hate double work um i i
 
02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
i've asked the chairman of hhs oversight
 
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
to schedule this particular
 
02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:42.550 align:start position:0%
to schedule this particular
topic

02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
topic
 
02:29:44.389 --> 02:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know how mr weeders would do it
 
02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
without your help or whoever is
 
02:29:48.309 --> 02:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
replacing you you can't be replaced but
 
02:29:50.389 --> 02:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
whoever whoever it is and you're in your
 
02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
seat um so
 
02:29:55.349 --> 02:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh but okay i i hear you and i i
 
02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate you saying that and
 
02:29:57.120 --> 02:29:57.910 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate you saying that and
um

02:29:57.910 --> 02:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:59.110 --> 02:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
you're giving me an opportunity to just
 
02:30:00.550 --> 02:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
say one thing that's very important to
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
me i am truly just a face in this
 
02:30:05.190 --> 02:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
department every piece of information
 
02:30:07.110 --> 02:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
you've received is from somebody on my
 
02:30:10.150 --> 02:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
staff and i have seen every single one
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
of them grow exponentially in the past
 
02:30:13.429 --> 02:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
four years and so i am entirely
 
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
confident that you're gonna still
 
02:30:16.790 --> 02:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
receive good information you'll just see
 
02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
a different face here
 
02:30:21.510 --> 02:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
and and i have to say to that that uh
 
02:30:24.469 --> 02:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
your leadership i think is critical
 
02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
because i've sensed nothing but
 
02:30:29.030 --> 02:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
integrity coming from you and your staff
 
02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
and that's a that's a personal attribute
 
02:30:33.429 --> 02:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
that has been passed on to the staff and
 
02:30:36.070 --> 02:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm gonna hopefully not miss that
 
02:30:38.710 --> 02:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
you will not i'm certain of it
 
02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:44.309 --> 02:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald thank you
 
02:30:46.950 --> 02:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
um would you be able to email this
 
02:30:49.510 --> 02:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
document so that we could blow it up and

search it yes i thought of you
 
02:30:52.469 --> 02:30:52.479 align:start position:0%

uh dashboard
 
02:31:14.469 --> 02:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
yes so actually that is a project that
 
02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
the department has been working on um i
 
02:31:18.630 --> 02:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
have been working on that project with
 
02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh mary kalise who many of you know is
 
02:31:22.230 --> 02:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
the deputy cfo and nathan white who's
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
the director of contracts uh and we have
 
02:31:26.469 --> 02:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
a follow-up meeting
 
02:31:28.469 --> 02:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
with this senior executive team at the
 
02:31:30.790 --> 02:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
department next week uh so i do
 
02:31:32.710 --> 02:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
anticipate that you will see a draft of
 
02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
that dashboard uh towards the end of the
 
02:31:36.710 --> 02:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year but we are actively working
 
02:31:38.070 --> 02:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
on that and
 
02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
making a much nicer and easier to read
 
02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
dashboard yeah
 
02:31:44.870 --> 02:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
the other thing is maybe you could get
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
rid of this font
 
02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
and then that way they wouldn't be able
 
02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
to use it so if if i understand
 
02:31:52.240 --> 02:31:53.830 align:start position:0%
to use it so if if i understand
correctly

02:31:53.830 --> 02:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
02:31:53.840 --> 02:31:54.710 align:start position:0%
correctly
uh

02:31:54.710 --> 02:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:57.030 --> 02:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
the department would like us to read
 
02:31:58.870 --> 02:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
through this
 
02:32:03.270 --> 02:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
and figure out which of these projects
 
02:32:06.630 --> 02:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
are ones that we're interested in yes
 
02:32:08.950 --> 02:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
and that we should get that back to you
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
by when
 
02:32:15.760 --> 02:32:15.770 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:15.770 --> 02:32:19.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:32:21.190 --> 02:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
after may 5th no uh
 
02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
no really truly whatever works for the
 
02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
committee i'm happy to you know work
 
02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
with the team to you know put together
 
02:32:28.389 --> 02:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
like i said i think a powerpoint is
 
02:32:30.389 --> 02:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
totally appropriate i just didn't want
 
02:32:33.429 --> 02:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
to do 75 slides so um i suspect there
 
02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
are certain grants that people are more
 
02:32:37.030 --> 02:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
interested in than others
 
02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
if i task you to
 
02:32:46.469 --> 02:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
have something to michael by may 5th
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
is that enough time or do we want more
 
02:32:48.479 --> 02:32:50.950 align:start position:0%
is that enough time or do we want more
time

02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:54.309 --> 02:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
okay may 5th it is
 
02:32:59.830 --> 02:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:59.840 --> 02:33:01.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:33:01.270 --> 02:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:33:03.830 --> 02:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much oh yes let
 
02:33:07.750 --> 02:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
me ask a question surely thank you yes
 
02:33:09.910 --> 02:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
so you showed six billion dollars looks
 
02:33:13.590 --> 02:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
like in total grant funding
 
02:33:13.600 --> 02:33:14.710 align:start position:0%
like in total grant funding
so

02:33:14.710 --> 02:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:15.830 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:33:15.830 --> 02:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think i totaled last page on the
 
02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:22.800 --> 02:33:23.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:33:23.830 --> 02:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:33:26.070 --> 02:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
yes but i think that's all the grants on
 
02:33:27.990 --> 02:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
this document i don't think that's just
 
02:33:30.550 --> 02:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
the grants that went to dhhs
 
02:33:32.070 --> 02:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
okay so i shouldn't ask a question about
 
02:33:33.510 --> 02:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
what the non-grant funding represents
 
02:33:35.510 --> 02:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
what's on the on the very last page uh
 
02:33:37.429 --> 02:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
no you could ask the lba that this is
 
02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
that part is their document i just like
 
02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
i said i tried to
 
02:33:44.230 --> 02:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
keep it on in a format that you all have
 
02:33:45.990 --> 02:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
seen before to try to make it a little
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
bit easier but um the ones that don't
 
02:33:50.630 --> 02:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
have an amount
 
02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
expended or a fiscal narrative are not
 
02:34:00.830 --> 02:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:04.710 --> 02:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
okay so we all have a task
 
02:34:06.309 --> 02:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
then hhs will have a task so
 
02:34:12.550 --> 02:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
okay and if you don't mind i'm we are
 
02:34:13.990 --> 02:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
going to head out unless there was a
 
02:34:15.510 --> 02:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
question that we should stay for the
 
02:34:17.190 --> 02:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
audit item
 
02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:19.040 align:start position:0%

a uh
 
02:35:05.590 --> 02:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
basically a verbal recitation of the
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
different programs that we've are we
 
02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
that we are running uh
 
02:35:11.990 --> 02:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
that apply to the 150 million dollars on
 
02:35:14.550 --> 02:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
our grants uh that we've received
 
02:35:17.429 --> 02:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
and the other table uh is
 
02:35:19.190 --> 02:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
set of tables is
 
02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
the status and the the offers that have
 
02:35:23.429 --> 02:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
gone out to the different uh systems
 
02:35:26.710 --> 02:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
both uh wastewater and drinking water
 
02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:35:32.070 --> 02:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
any case i will uh so this realification
 
02:35:33.510 --> 02:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
both these documents when we're done
 
02:35:34.550 --> 02:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
here we'll send those to you
 
02:35:37.349 --> 02:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
electronically uh and my intent is to
 
02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
briefly walk through the narrative
 
02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:40.550 align:start position:0%
briefly walk through the narrative
here

02:35:40.550 --> 02:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:35:40.560 --> 02:35:41.670 align:start position:0%
here
so

02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:44.469 --> 02:35:44.479 align:start position:0%
by way of backgrounds uh
 
02:35:46.710 --> 02:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
our estimate not including water
 
02:35:49.990 --> 02:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
contamination issues and
 
02:35:51.990 --> 02:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
future growth
 
02:35:54.150 --> 02:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
our understanding of the need for water
 
02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
and wastewater infrastructure
 
02:35:59.190 --> 02:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh work is in the for new hampshire's in
 
02:36:01.590 --> 02:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
excess of two billion dollars
 
02:36:04.309 --> 02:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh with that in mind we were very very
 
02:36:06.630 --> 02:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
pleased to be able to uh use you know
 
02:36:08.630 --> 02:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
last year you you were gracious enough
 
02:36:10.710 --> 02:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
to allocate 150 million dollars in opera
 
02:36:12.070 --> 02:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
funds to us
 
02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh what we have had done at that time uh
 
02:36:18.790 --> 02:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
and by way of background historically
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh we run uh this for clean water and
 
02:36:25.590 --> 02:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
when i say clean water that's uh
 
02:36:28.309 --> 02:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
waste water storm water and drinking
 
02:36:30.309 --> 02:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
water state revolving loan program so
 
02:36:34.469 --> 02:36:34.479 align:start position:0%
that's a annual uh program that we run
 
02:36:36.070 --> 02:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
and with that we do a annual
 
02:36:40.469 --> 02:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
solicitation for pre-applications uh so
 
02:36:42.469 --> 02:36:42.479 align:start position:0%
anticipating that there would be arpa
 
02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
funding coming
 
02:36:48.309 --> 02:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh staff signaled to the the usual
 
02:36:50.389 --> 02:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
parties if you will
 
02:36:52.630 --> 02:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
that's a possib that's more likely we
 
02:36:54.870 --> 02:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
will see that the opera funding
 
02:36:56.790 --> 02:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
to be coming from so within that with
 
02:36:59.510 --> 02:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
that in mind last june submittal
 
02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:00.309 align:start position:0%
that in mind last june submittal
for

02:37:00.309 --> 02:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:37:02.790 --> 02:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
applications for these loans was in
 
02:37:05.190 --> 02:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
excess of a billion dollars uh that we
 
02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
received for applications and we use
 
02:37:11.510 --> 02:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
that that that process
 
02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
in the first round to to basically uh
 
02:37:18.389 --> 02:37:18.399 align:start position:0%
augment the existing uh
 
02:37:20.790 --> 02:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
process we have for awarding uh funds
 
02:37:22.389 --> 02:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
for the state revolving loan fund so
 
02:37:25.030 --> 02:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
what what what staff was able to do is
 
02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
use the same criteria
 
02:37:30.870 --> 02:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh you a lot of them the system sent uh
 
02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
had applications into us and we were
 
02:37:35.349 --> 02:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
able to send offer letters to them uh to
 
02:37:37.590 --> 02:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
the extent good news you've gotten a
 
02:37:39.030 --> 02:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
state revolving loan fund that you've
 
02:37:40.150 --> 02:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
asked for
 
02:37:42.150 --> 02:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
better news instead of this amount it's
 
02:37:44.389 --> 02:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
going to be x amount alone and x amount
 
02:37:47.510 --> 02:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
of uh arpa funding to go with that
 
02:37:49.750 --> 02:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
once we ran out of the the amount of
 
02:37:51.670 --> 02:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
money allocated for state revolving loan
 
02:37:52.950 --> 02:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
fund offers
 
02:37:54.389 --> 02:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
then there was
 
02:37:55.750 --> 02:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
further uh
 
02:37:57.590 --> 02:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
monies that were allocated for our
 
02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
grants so those letters look to the
 
02:38:01.429 --> 02:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
extent that uh obviously i'm
 
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing bad news sorry you didn't
 
02:38:07.670 --> 02:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
qualify for an uh a srf loan this this
 
02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
year however
 
02:38:11.670 --> 02:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
you've been awarded a 20 grant for your
 
02:38:12.870 --> 02:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
project for
 
02:38:14.550 --> 02:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
for arpa
 
02:38:16.389 --> 02:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
and if you're able to put the rest of
 
02:38:19.110 --> 02:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
the project funding together you'll have
 
02:38:21.030 --> 02:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
this monies so
 
02:38:24.150 --> 02:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
and the reason why i mentioned offers so
 
02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:25.349 align:start position:0%
and the reason why i mentioned offers so
uh

02:38:25.349 --> 02:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:38:27.429 --> 02:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
a couple items on this
 
02:38:27.439 --> 02:38:28.630 align:start position:0%
a couple items on this
so

02:38:28.630 --> 02:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:38:30.150 --> 02:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
we don't just write a check if you've
 
02:38:32.230 --> 02:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
been awarded it's it's work that you
 
02:38:35.030 --> 02:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
have to meet milestones uh understanding
 
02:38:36.469 --> 02:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
that arpa
 
02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
has very definitive guidelines and i
 
02:38:40.469 --> 02:38:40.479 align:start position:0%
think we all agree we don't do not want
 
02:38:41.910 --> 02:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
to be giving money back to the federal
 
02:38:43.429 --> 02:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
government the money needs to be
 
02:38:45.670 --> 02:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
obligated by the end of the 24 and the
 
02:38:48.550 --> 02:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
project associated needs to be completed
 
02:38:51.270 --> 02:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh by december 2026
 
02:38:53.429 --> 02:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
so it's it's important also recognize
 
02:38:55.190 --> 02:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
that we put on these offer letters we
 
02:38:58.710 --> 02:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
put milestones in for instance often uh
 
02:39:00.630 --> 02:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
town meeting is required to to do
 
02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:01.830 align:start position:0%
town meeting is required to to do
approvals

02:39:01.830 --> 02:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
approvals
 
02:39:04.070 --> 02:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
and so it's it is possible as you look
 
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
through this list that some of these
 
02:39:07.830 --> 02:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
projects don't happen they're not able
 
02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
to meet the milestones that we put forth
 
02:39:12.150 --> 02:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
and we'll be in a mode where we'll need
 
02:39:14.469 --> 02:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
to reallocate if they haven't met them
 
02:39:16.230 --> 02:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
else the uh
 
02:39:18.150 --> 02:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
the milestones so that we can make sure
 
02:39:19.910 --> 02:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
a deserving project is able to get done
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
and the money is not sent back to the
 
02:39:23.030 --> 02:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
02:39:25.670 --> 02:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
so with that if you look at the
 
02:39:27.830 --> 02:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
the package uh
 
02:39:29.190 --> 02:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
with the narrative
 
02:39:31.910 --> 02:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh table one gives you an idea of the
 
02:39:34.150 --> 02:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
monies that have been offered so far so
 
02:39:39.910 --> 02:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:41.190 --> 02:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
and i'll explain the different
 
02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
categories here as we go through so that
 
02:39:45.510 --> 02:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
the main category is what i just
 
02:39:47.830 --> 02:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
described is is utilizing our our
 
02:39:50.070 --> 02:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
existing state revolving loan fund
 
02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:51.590 align:start position:0%
existing state revolving loan fund
programs

02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:39:53.270 --> 02:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
both for wastewater treatment storm
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
water drinking water and development of
 
02:39:56.950 --> 02:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
new water supplies
 
02:39:58.710 --> 02:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
the arpa grants
 
02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
associated with those range from 20 to
 
02:40:02.469 --> 02:40:02.479 align:start position:0%
50 percent
 
02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
we are doing another
 
02:40:07.270 --> 02:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
set round of applications for that to do
 
02:40:09.590 --> 02:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
the same type of thing and that that
 
02:40:11.910 --> 02:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
will be uh the applications will be
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
received up to june 1st of 2022 so
 
02:40:16.630 --> 02:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
that's a fairly typical thing we do so
 
02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's on an ongoing thing
 
02:40:20.870 --> 02:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
so that will add to the list that you
 
02:40:23.030 --> 02:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
you see on the the first table
 
02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
the other program we put together using
 
02:40:27.269 --> 02:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
the arpa funds is we're calling it
 
02:40:29.590 --> 02:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
assistance for disadvantaged communities
 
02:40:31.110 --> 02:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
and this has to do with residential
 
02:40:33.030 --> 02:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
owned communities manufacturing home
 
02:40:35.269 --> 02:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
cooperatives for co-ops
 
02:40:37.349 --> 02:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
so we have monies grant monies for them
 
02:40:39.670 --> 02:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
they're typically not able to leverage
 
02:40:42.230 --> 02:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
loans like some of the bigger systems so
 
02:40:44.870 --> 02:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
this has been a big help we out of the
 
02:40:46.630 --> 02:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
first solicitation
 
02:40:49.110 --> 02:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh from last year for srf loans we were
 
02:40:51.190 --> 02:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
able to pick eight projects that met the
 
02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:52.469 align:start position:0%
able to pick eight projects that met the
criteria

02:40:52.469 --> 02:40:52.479 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
02:40:55.269 --> 02:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh we are we have a sec first
 
02:40:57.349 --> 02:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
solicitation directly for these type of
 
02:40:59.670 --> 02:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
communities with applications due on one
 
02:41:03.670 --> 02:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
june 22 so we expect more for that
 
02:41:06.070 --> 02:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
the the third category is planning and
 
02:41:08.550 --> 02:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
long-term sustainability grants
 
02:41:11.830 --> 02:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh so we have a category here for
 
02:41:14.230 --> 02:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
you know as you may imagine especially
 
02:41:15.910 --> 02:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
the wastewater systems but the drinking
 
02:41:19.110 --> 02:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
water systems as well these things don't
 
02:41:21.190 --> 02:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
don't come out of nowhere they require a
 
02:41:23.190 --> 02:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
lot of a lot of planning up front to
 
02:41:25.590 --> 02:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
make all the pieces work so we were able
 
02:41:27.670 --> 02:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
to provide some funding for that
 
02:41:29.510 --> 02:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
and the other part of that is we're
 
02:41:31.670 --> 02:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
calling it system sustainability so
 
02:41:34.230 --> 02:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
asset management which is
 
02:41:36.389 --> 02:41:36.399 align:start position:0%
sounds easy but you'd be amazed at the
 
02:41:38.710 --> 02:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
number of systems that don't know where
 
02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
what their assets are where they are or
 
02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
the condition of them so obviously if
 
02:41:44.710 --> 02:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to be funding a project
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's pretty important for them to have
 
02:41:49.269 --> 02:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
that kind of information uh so so we we
 
02:41:51.349 --> 02:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
have long we have typically funded out
 
02:41:53.910 --> 02:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
of srf uh that type of activity and we
 
02:41:55.590 --> 02:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
will do that also and have been doing
 
02:41:57.510 --> 02:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
that with the arpa funds
 
02:41:59.510 --> 02:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
energy audits water
 
02:42:01.670 --> 02:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
audits and a new thing is uh cyber
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
security uh work uh which i'll talk
 
02:42:06.550 --> 02:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
about in a moment
 
02:42:10.469 --> 02:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
so the the cyber security uh work uh is
 
02:42:12.550 --> 02:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
where we are working with uh us
 
02:42:14.550 --> 02:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
department of homeland security
 
02:42:17.030 --> 02:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh we're recognizing that these systems
 
02:42:18.469 --> 02:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
nationally and certainly within the
 
02:42:20.070 --> 02:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
state too are vulnerable to cyber
 
02:42:22.469 --> 02:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
security uh vulnerabilities
 
02:42:24.389 --> 02:42:24.399 align:start position:0%
so we've worked with epa they have a
 
02:42:26.469 --> 02:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
contractor in us department of homeland
 
02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
security and we're offering free
 
02:42:29.750 --> 02:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
assessments for
 
02:42:31.590 --> 02:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
these systems once they have the
 
02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
assessments done they basically get a
 
02:42:35.429 --> 02:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
checklist of recommendations for things
 
02:42:36.469 --> 02:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:42:38.950 --> 02:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
and for those systems we're offering
 
02:42:41.269 --> 02:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
grants up to fifty thousand dollars for
 
02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
for per drinking water system or a
 
02:42:44.469 --> 02:42:44.479 align:start position:0%
wastewater system
 
02:42:46.070 --> 02:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh so far we've received five
 
02:42:48.630 --> 02:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
applications that may sound like not a
 
02:42:50.309 --> 02:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
lot but again you have to get the the
 
02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
assessment done first so that will be an
 
02:42:54.550 --> 02:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
ongoing effort for us that's being
 
02:42:57.190 --> 02:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
looked at nationally as a
 
02:42:59.429 --> 02:42:59.439 align:start position:0%
as a best practice by the way
 
02:43:01.510 --> 02:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh another area we're able to get at
 
02:43:03.510 --> 02:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
with the arpa funding that we typically
 
02:43:05.750 --> 02:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to do with srf money
 
02:43:07.990 --> 02:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
because there's just so much demand is
 
02:43:10.950 --> 02:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
flood risk uh so so funding projects for
 
02:43:12.870 --> 02:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
flood resilience storm water management
 
02:43:15.030 --> 02:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
planning and assessment work as well as
 
02:43:17.670 --> 02:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
implementation so uh you know that
 
02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
includes projects on the coast obviously
 
02:43:21.750 --> 02:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
but also obviously the western part of
 
02:43:23.429 --> 02:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
the state last year had a lot of flood
 
02:43:25.590 --> 02:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
flood damage and that type of thing so
 
02:43:28.389 --> 02:43:28.399 align:start position:0%
we're we're able to with this expanded
 
02:43:29.990 --> 02:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
pot of money we're able to actually get
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
at some of the funding for those type of
 
02:43:33.190 --> 02:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
projects also
 
02:43:35.269 --> 02:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
and then unfortunately it seems like i
 
02:43:36.950 --> 02:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
can't have any discussion without the
 
02:43:39.030 --> 02:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
four-letter word of pfas
 
02:43:41.670 --> 02:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
so we are also uh able to leverage some
 
02:43:44.230 --> 02:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
of this money as a grant program
 
02:43:46.389 --> 02:43:46.399 align:start position:0%
that leverages the loan program that the
 
02:43:48.309 --> 02:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
legislature was able to do a few years
 
02:43:48.319 --> 02:43:49.910 align:start position:0%
legislature was able to do a few years
ago

02:43:49.910 --> 02:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:43:51.910 --> 02:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
they allowed us to bond up to 50 million
 
02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:53.269 align:start position:0%
they allowed us to bond up to 50 million
dollars

02:43:53.269 --> 02:43:53.279 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:43:55.830 --> 02:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
to fund pfas remediation for those
 
02:43:57.750 --> 02:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
systems so we're able to to match some
 
02:43:59.349 --> 02:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
of that money also
 
02:44:01.429 --> 02:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
and the last category we're calling it
 
02:44:03.429 --> 02:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
that we've been funding is we're calling
 
02:44:05.750 --> 02:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
it strategically important water supply
 
02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:07.750 align:start position:0%
it strategically important water supply
projects

02:44:07.750 --> 02:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
projects
 
02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
and so we've we so far funded for those
 
02:44:12.630 --> 02:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
projects those are on the table also uh
 
02:44:14.950 --> 02:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
one of them was the scoping project for
 
02:44:16.230 --> 02:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
the fist hatcheries you just talked
 
02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:17.590 align:start position:0%
the fist hatcheries you just talked
about

02:44:17.590 --> 02:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:20.230 align:start position:0%
about
and

02:44:20.230 --> 02:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:23.429 --> 02:44:23.439 align:start position:0%
excuse me my voice is failing um and one
 
02:44:25.349 --> 02:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
is also to help the title londonderry
 
02:44:26.469 --> 02:44:26.479 align:start position:0%
they are
 
02:44:26.479 --> 02:44:27.910 align:start position:0%
they are
the

02:44:27.910 --> 02:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:44:29.429 --> 02:44:29.439 align:start position:0%
largest concentration of private
 
02:44:30.950 --> 02:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
drinking water wells in the state right
 
02:44:32.630 --> 02:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
now that that have been addressed for
 
02:44:34.710 --> 02:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
pfas contamination so we're working with
 
02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
them on
 
02:44:38.309 --> 02:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
some planting money on how to best best
 
02:44:39.670 --> 02:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
scope out
 
02:44:41.670 --> 02:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully a water system to replace
 
02:44:42.950 --> 02:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
those drinking water wells that are
 
02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:44.630 align:start position:0%
those drinking water wells that are
contaminated

02:44:44.630 --> 02:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
contaminated
 
02:44:46.950 --> 02:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
so with that uh certainly happy to
 
02:44:48.710 --> 02:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
answer any questions i realize it's late
 
02:44:50.150 --> 02:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
in the day also
 
02:44:53.830 --> 02:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh again our intent is to to send out uh
 
02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
these materials also electronically
 
02:44:57.349 --> 02:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
especially this one has a lot of links
 
02:44:59.510 --> 02:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
on it you will note when you see that
 
02:45:01.349 --> 02:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
our website is
 
02:45:02.630 --> 02:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
basically talks about everything that
 
02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
i've been talking about is on our
 
02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:05.349 align:start position:0%
i've been talking about is on our
website

02:45:05.349 --> 02:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
website
 
02:45:06.550 --> 02:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd be happy to take
 
02:45:10.070 --> 02:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:11.990 --> 02:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
senator morris yeah i'd just like to
 
02:45:16.150 --> 02:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
point out so there's no surprises on the
 
02:45:18.790 --> 02:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
house side uh the commissioner reminded
 
02:45:21.830 --> 02:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
me when he came in today um we will have
 
02:45:23.510 --> 02:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
to put money
 
02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:24.630 align:start position:0%
to put money
um

02:45:24.630 --> 02:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:28.630 --> 02:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
to match the srf money that's coming
 
02:45:29.830 --> 02:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:45:32.230 --> 02:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
to the state for 23
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
so i think it's 22 and 23 actually
 
02:45:38.550 --> 02:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
so we'll be putting an amendment on
 
02:45:40.070 --> 02:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
something and sending it over to the
 
02:45:40.080 --> 02:45:41.269 align:start position:0%
something and sending it over to the
house

02:45:41.269 --> 02:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:45:43.110 --> 02:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
so that we can take the additional money
 
02:45:47.110 --> 02:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
that washington has right now on srf
 
02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:48.070 align:start position:0%
that washington has right now on srf
okay

02:45:48.070 --> 02:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:45:50.070 --> 02:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me so
 
02:45:53.830 --> 02:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
we put our srf money in in the budget
 
02:45:56.230 --> 02:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
but because of the new money we have to
 
02:45:59.910 --> 02:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
add to the srf is that so
 
02:46:02.790 --> 02:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
in the chart that i've been
 
02:46:05.030 --> 02:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
following that mike has
 
02:46:07.670 --> 02:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
we actually have it on there and the srf
 
02:46:09.349 --> 02:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
funding is on there
 
02:46:14.309 --> 02:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
the additional srf funding so okay
 
02:46:16.630 --> 02:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
well some things come with good news and
 
02:46:18.389 --> 02:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
some things come with the only thing is
 
02:46:22.230 --> 02:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
as we talk about who can have the money
 
02:46:25.830 --> 02:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
that is for the poorer communities not
 
02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:26.710 align:start position:0%
that is for the poorer communities not
for

02:46:26.710 --> 02:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:46:28.950 --> 02:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
the wealthier community so there's a
 
02:46:31.429 --> 02:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
couple things going on there so but it
 
02:46:33.830 --> 02:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
does have a high level of forgiveness
 
02:46:36.070 --> 02:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
with it so okay
 
02:46:37.429 --> 02:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
that's great
 
02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
are there
 
02:46:41.349 --> 02:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
i i really i really appreciate this and
 
02:46:43.349 --> 02:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:46:45.429 --> 02:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
you have summed this up very well in
 
02:46:48.469 --> 02:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
your um in in your presentation
 
02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:56.150 --> 02:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry senator gaida i'd just like
 
02:46:58.150 --> 02:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
to request a couple of minutes with you
 
02:46:59.750 --> 02:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
after we're done assuming we're done
 
02:47:01.990 --> 02:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
fairly shortly thanks that's fine i'll
 
02:47:05.990 --> 02:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
but this is uh this is the kind of thing
 
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
that uh i think it's important for us to
 
02:47:14.710 --> 02:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
know how we're
 
02:47:17.750 --> 02:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
spending this money
 
02:47:19.429 --> 02:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
wherever it is so
 
02:47:21.429 --> 02:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
02:47:23.269 --> 02:47:23.279 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:47:23.279 --> 02:47:25.110 align:start position:0%
very much
and

02:47:25.110 --> 02:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:47:31.750 --> 02:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:36.710 --> 02:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:39.590 --> 02:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
how come did i miss that on here
 
02:47:42.070 --> 02:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
no it was not on the agenda um you would
 
02:47:43.190 --> 02:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
ask the commissioner to come back and
 
02:47:50.230 --> 02:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:52.950 --> 02:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
hi hi
 
02:47:54.469 --> 02:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
i'm charlie arlinghaus i'm the
 
02:47:56.230 --> 02:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner of administrative services
 
02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
but maybe you knew that um
 
02:48:01.269 --> 02:48:01.279 align:start position:0%
so i'm here to talk to you as much as
 
02:48:04.389 --> 02:48:04.399 align:start position:0%
you want about vacancies um i passed out
 
02:48:05.750 --> 02:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
i didn't pass out
 
02:48:08.389 --> 02:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
mike did actually um but i handed it to
 
02:48:10.950 --> 02:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
him um four sheets of paper which give
 
02:48:13.110 --> 02:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
you a sense of what i think i want to
 
02:48:15.190 --> 02:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
give you every month the sheet that says
 
02:48:16.469 --> 02:48:16.479 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates for the state of new
 
02:48:16.479 --> 02:48:17.510 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates for the state of new
hampshire

02:48:17.510 --> 02:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:48:19.910 --> 02:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
and then the total by department
 
02:48:19.920 --> 02:48:20.870 align:start position:0%
and then the total by department
um

02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:22.870 --> 02:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
page three is a list where we broke it
 
02:48:24.230 --> 02:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
out based on some things people were
 
02:48:25.349 --> 02:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
asking about
 
02:48:27.590 --> 02:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
um the class 10s and the class 59s are
 
02:48:29.990 --> 02:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
separate so you can understand both by
 
02:48:32.790 --> 02:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
department etc how those look
 
02:48:34.630 --> 02:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
um i think those charts are
 
02:48:37.750 --> 02:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory um the page four i gave
 
02:48:39.750 --> 02:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
you is is we've started looking trying
 
02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
to do some data analysis on trends
 
02:48:44.309 --> 02:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
and understand what's going on when it
 
02:48:46.790 --> 02:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
started when it's stopping etc and this
 
02:48:49.030 --> 02:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
is just a quarterly snapshot for you
 
02:48:50.070 --> 02:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
when you look at the numbers at the
 
02:48:52.309 --> 02:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
bottom you can see how they're growing
 
02:48:54.870 --> 02:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
although they appear to tick down
 
02:48:57.030 --> 02:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
0.1 percentage point in the last eight
 
02:49:00.309 --> 02:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
days which i suppose is nice um but i
 
02:49:02.389 --> 02:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
want to mention uh the chairman had a
 
02:49:04.870 --> 02:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
specific question about
 
02:49:07.269 --> 02:49:07.279 align:start position:0%
um class 59 positions and we've created
 
02:49:08.870 --> 02:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
about 104
 
02:49:10.630 --> 02:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
um i actually asked our data people to
 
02:49:13.110 --> 02:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
do this is this is close but not exactly
 
02:49:15.030 --> 02:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
the same thing probably because then
 
02:49:16.630 --> 02:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes some positions aren't stood up
 
02:49:17.910 --> 02:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
right away and there's so there's
 
02:49:19.830 --> 02:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
probably an overlap issue but
 
02:49:21.990 --> 02:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
since july 1st we've stood up about 106
 
02:49:25.429 --> 02:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
positions and 77 of them are filled and
 
02:49:28.150 --> 02:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
and that's i for yours for your question
 
02:49:29.590 --> 02:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
about whether we're filling positions or
 
02:49:31.510 --> 02:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
not whether we're taking care of them or
 
02:49:34.150 --> 02:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
not um that's a more useful data point
 
02:49:35.910 --> 02:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
than the um
 
02:49:39.349 --> 02:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
185 of 407 positions are filled
 
02:49:41.990 --> 02:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
um i want to mention a couple things are
 
02:49:43.670 --> 02:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
we losing ground yeah we're losing
 
02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:44.710 align:start position:0%
we losing ground yeah we're losing
ground

02:49:44.710 --> 02:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
ground
 
02:49:46.950 --> 02:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
our goal the whole reason as we started
 
02:49:48.790 --> 02:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
this standing up a statewide recruitment
 
02:49:52.469 --> 02:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
unit is to stop losing ground
 
02:49:54.550 --> 02:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
and and i think that's gonna happen we
 
02:49:56.790 --> 02:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
hired three very very good people
 
02:49:59.110 --> 02:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
um congratulations yeah well we do what
 
02:50:02.389 --> 02:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
we can yeah um so in fact one of them uh
 
02:50:04.790 --> 02:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
behind me or probably behind joe i'm
 
02:50:06.550 --> 02:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
gonna do this without turning around
 
02:50:08.230 --> 02:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
cassie keene is our deputy commissioner
 
02:50:09.750 --> 02:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know cassie laurie roos the director
 
02:50:12.150 --> 02:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
of personnel but we hired kate uh
 
02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
malavey who's over here um and she comes
 
02:50:17.990 --> 02:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
to the state service from the military
 
02:50:19.429 --> 02:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna say nice things about her
 
02:50:22.150 --> 02:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
or she could probably kill me um which
 
02:50:24.389 --> 02:50:24.399 align:start position:0%
we're against um just broadly speaking
 
02:50:27.269 --> 02:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
but kate is heading that unit um i'll be
 
02:50:29.510 --> 02:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
meeting with her regularly i did on her
 
02:50:31.510 --> 02:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
first day which was a week ago
 
02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:32.870 align:start position:0%
first day which was a week ago
um

02:50:32.870 --> 02:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:35.269 --> 02:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
and we're we're doing things for example
 
02:50:37.110 --> 02:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's a week so i don't you know
 
02:50:39.510 --> 02:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
don't expect every uh everything to turn
 
02:50:41.590 --> 02:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
around in a day you know the queen mary
 
02:50:44.790 --> 02:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't pivot it gradually
 
02:50:47.269 --> 02:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
turns um but we did some work on we did
 
02:50:49.750 --> 02:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
a uh an email blast to lna's you know
 
02:50:51.429 --> 02:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
this is a this isn't brain surgery right
 
02:50:52.790 --> 02:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
you get a list of the
 
02:50:56.230 --> 02:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
lnas and uh from licensing and then you
 
02:50:57.510 --> 02:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
email them and say do you know the
 
02:50:59.590 --> 02:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
state's hiring and
 
02:51:02.630 --> 02:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
we had uh we had 10 interviews within 24
 
02:51:04.870 --> 02:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
hours and so it's little things like
 
02:51:06.950 --> 02:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
that that this is going to happen
 
02:51:10.550 --> 02:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
i i want you to understand that in in if
 
02:51:13.110 --> 02:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
you look at the current fiscal year just
 
02:51:17.269 --> 02:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:19.590 --> 02:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
it's easy for us to look at the number
 
02:51:21.429 --> 02:51:21.439 align:start position:0%
of vacant positions as a snapshot in
 
02:51:24.469 --> 02:51:24.479 align:start position:0%
time oh my god we can't hire anybody
 
02:51:26.469 --> 02:51:26.479 align:start position:0%
well i would tell you this we hired
 
02:51:29.190 --> 02:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
we've hired in the state about 4 000
 
02:51:29.200 --> 02:51:30.469 align:start position:0%
we've hired in the state about 4 000
people

02:51:30.469 --> 02:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:51:32.710 --> 02:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
in the last nine months
 
02:51:34.790 --> 02:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
and so and i i got at this i started
 
02:51:36.230 --> 02:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
looking at my own department you know
 
02:51:37.670 --> 02:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
some of those are from other agencies
 
02:51:40.870 --> 02:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
about half right but we've hired 1900
 
02:51:43.830 --> 02:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
ish 1911 i think don't hold me to that
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
um people from outside new hires or
 
02:51:48.950 --> 02:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
rehires which is just a term for someone
 
02:51:50.790 --> 02:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
who worked for the state six months ago
 
02:51:54.230 --> 02:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
or 20 years ago but 1900 new people
 
02:51:57.190 --> 02:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
coming in we have people leaving
 
02:51:59.269 --> 02:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
and that's an issue and the goal is to
 
02:52:01.990 --> 02:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
is to get that to change are
 
02:52:03.510 --> 02:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
are people leaving in greater numbers
 
02:52:04.870 --> 02:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
than they used to
 
02:52:06.790 --> 02:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
preliminary look is that it doesn't look
 
02:52:09.110 --> 02:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
like it um and i'm trying to compare
 
02:52:10.710 --> 02:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
apples to apples which turns out to be
 
02:52:12.150 --> 02:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
harder than you think
 
02:52:13.990 --> 02:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
um but and so part of this is there's
 
02:52:15.670 --> 02:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of data analysis over
 
02:52:17.590 --> 02:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
the next um
 
02:52:19.429 --> 02:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
months going and i'm i'm actually going
 
02:52:20.950 --> 02:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
to try to do a lot of that myself i sort
 
02:52:22.389 --> 02:52:22.399 align:start position:0%
of like data
 
02:52:24.870 --> 02:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
um and um and it seems like it'd be an
 
02:52:26.150 --> 02:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
interesting thing to do and it makes it
 
02:52:28.070 --> 02:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
easier for me to talk about when i've
 
02:52:30.950 --> 02:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
actually looked at it directly um
 
02:52:33.190 --> 02:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
but we hire a lot of people and and so
 
02:52:34.630 --> 02:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's not that people aren't interested
 
02:52:36.070 --> 02:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
in the state as an employer they still
 
02:52:38.230 --> 02:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
are 2 000 people who didn't used to work
 
02:52:40.070 --> 02:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
here do work here again
 
02:52:43.030 --> 02:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
but we've lost ground in in recent time
 
02:52:46.630 --> 02:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
but the idea is to is to is to push that
 
02:52:49.990 --> 02:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
and turn it slowly and get there and i
 
02:52:51.910 --> 02:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
think i think that's the point that
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes we fall back on
 
02:52:57.030 --> 02:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
um we fall back on a narrative right
 
02:52:58.870 --> 02:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
that you this is sort of a newspaper
 
02:53:01.429 --> 02:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
level analogy or the not newspaper level
 
02:53:04.309 --> 02:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
headline level right the you know hiring
 
02:53:06.550 --> 02:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
impossible and in our heads we draw a
 
02:53:07.990 --> 02:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
picture of
 
02:53:09.510 --> 02:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
you know i post a position and no one
 
02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
applies and nobody interviews and i
 
02:53:12.309 --> 02:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
can't get anybody
 
02:53:14.630 --> 02:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
i spend half my life interviewing every
 
02:53:16.070 --> 02:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
final interview i've mentioned this year
 
02:53:18.950 --> 02:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
before i'm i do usually cassie and i do
 
02:53:20.870 --> 02:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
02:53:22.150 --> 02:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
because i think it's important for the
 
02:53:24.790 --> 02:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
culture of the department um but i feel
 
02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
like i'm doing them all the time it's
 
02:53:29.670 --> 02:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
not true it's a few a week but
 
02:53:31.349 --> 02:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of hiring going on people
 
02:53:33.269 --> 02:53:33.279 align:start position:0%
are posting positions regularly
 
02:53:35.269 --> 02:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
obviously at 20 vacancy rates you post
 
02:53:37.670 --> 02:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
positions a lot we get applicants we get
 
02:53:39.990 --> 02:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of very good applicants i'm not
 
02:53:41.910 --> 02:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
hiring mediocre people when they come to
 
02:53:44.469 --> 02:53:44.479 align:start position:0%
the door i'm hiring very good people um
 
02:53:47.110 --> 02:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
we often leave that interview um saying
 
02:53:49.590 --> 02:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
not something like like they seem like
 
02:53:51.670 --> 02:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
they might be okay but wow i really
 
02:53:53.349 --> 02:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
liked her she was great
 
02:53:55.510 --> 02:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
and um and i want a lot of that and
 
02:53:57.750 --> 02:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
let's hope i'm right right that you know
 
02:54:00.950 --> 02:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
she seemed great um but um
 
02:54:03.190 --> 02:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of that going on but a big
 
02:54:04.790 --> 02:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
piece of it is that there's a lot
 
02:54:07.269 --> 02:54:07.279 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to do a high vacancy rate
 
02:54:09.349 --> 02:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
does a couple things um gives you a lot
 
02:54:11.110 --> 02:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
of opportunity to rebuild your team and
 
02:54:13.030 --> 02:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
to do new things with your team
 
02:54:15.590 --> 02:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
but it also means that that there's a
 
02:54:18.389 --> 02:54:18.399 align:start position:0%
lot of work that goes on before
 
02:54:19.670 --> 02:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of work that goes into
 
02:54:19.680 --> 02:54:20.389 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of work that goes into
that

02:54:20.389 --> 02:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:54:21.590 --> 02:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
and one of the i think one of the
 
02:54:23.349 --> 02:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
hardest things for hiring managers i'm
 
02:54:25.269 --> 02:54:25.279 align:start position:0%
trying to develop sympathies
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
for hiring managers is um
 
02:54:31.269 --> 02:54:31.279 align:start position:0%
hiring is a job it's a lot of work
 
02:54:33.190 --> 02:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
and it's particularly a lot of work in a
 
02:54:36.309 --> 02:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
system like ours which involves a lot of
 
02:54:38.469 --> 02:54:38.479 align:start position:0%
paperwork and things like that and i'm
 
02:54:39.990 --> 02:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that a lot of it's not
 
02:54:41.990 --> 02:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
important because we you know taxpayer
 
02:54:44.389 --> 02:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
protections etc
 
02:54:45.910 --> 02:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
but it's a lot of work and sometimes
 
02:54:47.429 --> 02:54:47.439 align:start position:0%
you're thinking yourself i've got a job
 
02:54:49.190 --> 02:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
i can barely keep up with
 
02:54:51.349 --> 02:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
and now i got to devote
 
02:54:53.429 --> 02:54:53.439 align:start position:0%
10 hours a week for a few weeks to doing
 
02:54:55.510 --> 02:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
something that's not quote-unquote my
 
02:54:58.309 --> 02:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
job but helps me do my job so there's a
 
02:55:00.150 --> 02:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
lot of that and and i think a big piece
 
02:55:02.150 --> 02:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
of what we're going to try to do is to
 
02:55:04.469 --> 02:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
help people along with that and you know
 
02:55:05.990 --> 02:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're not going to we're not we don't
 
02:55:07.429 --> 02:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
have a statewide recruitment unit to
 
02:55:09.030 --> 02:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
help with every position
 
02:55:11.190 --> 02:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
but we have a recruitment unit to help
 
02:55:13.750 --> 02:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
everybody and everybody get further down
 
02:55:15.269 --> 02:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
the road and i think that's what's gonna
 
02:55:17.030 --> 02:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
happen we really are trying to turn the
 
02:55:20.070 --> 02:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
queen mary around not um
 
02:55:23.750 --> 02:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
not to uh donuts in the parking lot
 
02:55:27.990 --> 02:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
i think that works as an analogy yeah
 
02:55:29.830 --> 02:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions uh
 
02:55:31.990 --> 02:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
02:55:35.990 --> 02:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair um
 
02:55:39.030 --> 02:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
one one was the last time
 
02:55:39.040 --> 02:55:40.150 align:start position:0%
one one was the last time
our

02:55:40.150 --> 02:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:55:42.790 --> 02:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh public-facing
 
02:55:46.150 --> 02:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh website the application uh when was
 
02:55:48.309 --> 02:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
the last time it was updated
 
02:55:50.870 --> 02:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh and and the genesis of this question
 
02:55:52.790 --> 02:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
is about three years ago
 
02:55:55.269 --> 02:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
i went and played around with the uh the
 
02:55:58.150 --> 02:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
job from from the public's perspective
 
02:56:00.950 --> 02:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
if i knew i wanted a job with the state
 
02:56:03.269 --> 02:56:03.279 align:start position:0%
the search function was just horrible it
 
02:56:06.070 --> 02:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
was the one of the worst websites i've
 
02:56:08.870 --> 02:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
ever seen and so i talked to dennis
 
02:56:10.870 --> 02:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
goulet about it and he said the good
 
02:56:13.429 --> 02:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
news is that the application underneath
 
02:56:13.439 --> 02:56:14.230 align:start position:0%
news is that the application underneath
that

02:56:14.230 --> 02:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
was free
 
02:56:18.070 --> 02:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
so i suggested to him that we probably
 
02:56:20.790 --> 02:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
want to spend some money so that we can
 
02:56:23.830 --> 02:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
improve our public-facing
 
02:56:26.389 --> 02:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
search engine so that they can find jobs
 
02:56:29.429 --> 02:56:29.439 align:start position:0%
that they are qualified for so so back
 
02:56:32.389 --> 02:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
to the question when was the last time
 
02:56:35.990 --> 02:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
that software uh that faces the public
 
02:56:38.710 --> 02:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
was updated do you know we're uh so
 
02:56:40.950 --> 02:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
we're in the process of uh redoing it
 
02:56:44.230 --> 02:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
regularly um as as you may know the the
 
02:56:45.910 --> 02:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
governor had a very similar experience
 
02:56:48.630 --> 02:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
in late 2017 early 2018
 
02:56:48.640 --> 02:56:49.750 align:start position:0%
in late 2017 early 2018
um

02:56:49.750 --> 02:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:51.830 --> 02:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
and expressed himself in fairly similar
 
02:56:53.910 --> 02:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
terms terms from his playing around on
 
02:56:56.870 --> 02:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
it and um i forget how he described his
 
02:56:58.710 --> 02:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
assessment of the performance of it but
 
02:56:58.720 --> 02:56:59.670 align:start position:0%
assessment of the performance of it but
um

02:56:59.670 --> 02:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:01.910 --> 02:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
there's probably words i can't use
 
02:57:03.830 --> 02:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
um so we've looked at that the the
 
02:57:06.870 --> 02:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
latest iteration probably went went up
 
02:57:10.389 --> 02:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:11.750 --> 02:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say a year and a half ago
 
02:57:13.269 --> 02:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
but don't hold me to that it might be it
 
02:57:15.030 --> 02:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
might be just before covet or it might
 
02:57:17.190 --> 02:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
be just in the beginning of covid that's
 
02:57:19.590 --> 02:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
not to say that we updated and looked
 
02:57:21.110 --> 02:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
pretty good we made some improvements to
 
02:57:23.030 --> 02:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
it there are under there's underlying
 
02:57:24.710 --> 02:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
functionality with the system that's
 
02:57:27.269 --> 02:57:27.279 align:start position:0%
problematic um the the system as you
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
probably know are our our system is run
 
02:57:31.590 --> 02:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
by infor our enterprise resource system
 
02:57:34.070 --> 02:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
is run by infor and it was developed as
 
02:57:37.269 --> 02:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
in sort of a hybrid fashion um the the
 
02:57:39.429 --> 02:57:39.439 align:start position:0%
bid was run one 10 years ago 12 years
 
02:57:41.990 --> 02:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
ago whenever 16 years ago joe maybe
 
02:57:43.910 --> 02:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
by a company called lawson
 
02:57:45.510 --> 02:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the underlying technology
 
02:57:46.870 --> 02:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
comes from lawson which is a company
 
02:57:49.110 --> 02:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
that infor bought and a lot of that
 
02:57:51.590 --> 02:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
technology i think people call it the s3
 
02:57:53.910 --> 02:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
side is
 
02:57:56.389 --> 02:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
mediocre and it was a company that won
 
02:57:58.309 --> 02:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh they were the low bidder
 
02:58:00.070 --> 02:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
and uh somebody once said well you got
 
02:58:01.349 --> 02:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
what you paid for
 
02:58:03.110 --> 02:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
there's another side of it which is more
 
02:58:04.710 --> 02:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
developed with infor infor has been
 
02:58:07.990 --> 02:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
updating their product um we're uh we're
 
02:58:09.349 --> 02:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
looking we've been meeting regularly
 
02:58:11.670 --> 02:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
with dennis actually over the last
 
02:58:14.230 --> 02:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know six eight weeks and and
 
02:58:15.830 --> 02:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
i know cassie can shake her head behind
 
02:58:17.349 --> 02:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
me if i have the timing wrong but we had
 
02:58:18.790 --> 02:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
a big meeting to talk about what do we
 
02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
do do we get a whole new system and and
 
02:58:23.830 --> 02:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind that the job function is
 
02:58:26.630 --> 02:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
integrated into the system for uh for
 
02:58:28.150 --> 02:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
management reasons
 
02:58:30.389 --> 02:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
um do we get a whole new system you know
 
02:58:32.230 --> 02:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
we oracle and workday and everybody else
 
02:58:34.710 --> 02:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
bids on it and how much does that cost
 
02:58:36.550 --> 02:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
do we do nothing which is the state
 
02:58:38.230 --> 02:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
approach of the 80s and 90s we did
 
02:58:40.550 --> 02:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
nothing in ghrs and ifs eventually
 
02:58:42.710 --> 02:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
disintegrated uh to the point where
 
02:58:44.790 --> 02:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
nobody could fix them anymore
 
02:58:47.429 --> 02:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
and we had to reprocure or do we do the
 
02:58:49.910 --> 02:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
next iteration of infor which includes
 
02:58:52.230 --> 02:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
moving from land-based to cloud-based
 
02:58:54.630 --> 02:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
um and a significant upgrade which they
 
02:58:56.309 --> 02:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
call cloud suite which is different from
 
02:58:58.230 --> 02:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
being on the cloud i think that's where
 
02:58:59.510 --> 02:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to land but it's an
 
02:59:02.550 --> 02:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
expensive long proposition
 
02:59:04.309 --> 02:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
that will improve things but we can't
 
02:59:06.550 --> 02:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
wait for that to improve things
 
02:59:09.110 --> 02:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
the application is mediocre or the
 
02:59:10.870 --> 02:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
application process is mediocre for
 
02:59:12.630 --> 02:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
example when i interview people i hate
 
02:59:12.640 --> 02:59:13.269 align:start position:0%
example when i interview people i hate
it

02:59:13.269 --> 02:59:13.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:59:15.670 --> 02:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
when the so what happens is our our
 
02:59:17.269 --> 02:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
managers give me
 
02:59:19.269 --> 02:59:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh resumes to look at and i want a
 
02:59:21.269 --> 02:59:21.279 align:start position:0%
resume i don't want our application and
 
02:59:22.950 --> 02:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
that tells me something right that the
 
02:59:25.190 --> 02:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
fact that i hate the state application
 
02:59:26.630 --> 02:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
and it's the state application we do
 
02:59:29.590 --> 02:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
means it's bad um so we're we're trying
 
02:59:31.510 --> 02:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
to improve it some of it is written into
 
02:59:33.429 --> 02:59:33.439 align:start position:0%
the rules and so we're in the process of
 
02:59:35.349 --> 02:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
doing a rules upgrade i actually have a
 
02:59:38.070 --> 02:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
have a very preliminary draft of
 
02:59:39.830 --> 02:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
personnel rules upgrades and one of the
 
02:59:42.870 --> 02:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
goals is to take
 
02:59:44.309 --> 02:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of ways to do rules but
 
02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
one of them is you specify every line
 
02:59:47.910 --> 02:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
item and the rules will just decide you
 
02:59:50.550 --> 02:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
know what's in box 12 what's in box 13
 
02:59:52.710 --> 02:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
which i think is insane and we're trying
 
02:59:54.630 --> 02:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
to get away from that if the
 
02:59:57.030 --> 02:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
if the officer rules lets us
 
02:59:58.469 --> 02:59:58.479 align:start position:0%
um and we're gonna so we're gonna change
 
03:00:00.469 --> 03:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
our rules so we're gonna get there but a
 
03:00:03.190 --> 03:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
big piece of recruitment is to make this
 
03:00:06.550 --> 03:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
is to make it easier to apply one
 
03:00:08.150 --> 03:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
um well first of all easier to find out
 
03:00:10.550 --> 03:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
about job two easier to apply three
 
03:00:12.710 --> 03:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
easier to certify for a job we've made
 
03:00:14.870 --> 03:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
some significant progress in that some
 
03:00:16.710 --> 03:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
some i think very important rule changes
 
03:00:18.469 --> 03:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
that actually other states are adopting
 
03:00:18.479 --> 03:00:19.349 align:start position:0%
that actually other states are adopting
now

03:00:19.349 --> 03:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:00:19.359 --> 03:00:20.469 align:start position:0%
now
um

03:00:20.469 --> 03:00:20.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:22.950 --> 03:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
and then easier for a manager to hire
 
03:00:25.349 --> 03:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
you and get the
 
03:00:27.590 --> 03:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
that processed so that you can get in
 
03:00:30.150 --> 03:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
the door because everything that extends
 
03:00:32.710 --> 03:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
the time i apply for three jobs
 
03:00:35.670 --> 03:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
and um i get an offer from
 
03:00:38.389 --> 03:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
you know deca in four days i'm not going
 
03:00:39.590 --> 03:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
to wait a month for the state to get
 
03:00:41.750 --> 03:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
back to me so
 
03:00:43.190 --> 03:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
we've updated recently but we have a
 
03:00:46.309 --> 03:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:48.389 --> 03:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
did you want to follow up yes
 
03:00:50.790 --> 03:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
very comprehensive answer glad to hear
 
03:00:53.269 --> 03:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
that you have visibility of it because i
 
03:00:55.110 --> 03:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
i do think one of the reasons we have
 
03:00:57.910 --> 03:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
trouble hiring people is people can't
 
03:01:01.030 --> 03:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
try to be hired very well so the other
 
03:01:03.030 --> 03:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
part i just would ask you to keep your
 
03:01:03.990 --> 03:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
eye on
 
03:01:07.030 --> 03:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of our jobs were able to
 
03:01:09.269 --> 03:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
offer a veteran's preference
 
03:01:11.750 --> 03:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
and as i recall the application there
 
03:01:13.670 --> 03:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
was no way to search
 
03:01:16.389 --> 03:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
to say i'm a veteran tell me which jobs
 
03:01:18.790 --> 03:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
are available for which a veteran would
 
03:01:21.429 --> 03:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
have preference so so that was a
 
03:01:23.670 --> 03:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
specific functionality that i thought
 
03:01:26.070 --> 03:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
should be included but oh i'll look into
 
03:01:27.910 --> 03:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
that i know i looked at veterans
 
03:01:29.590 --> 03:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
preferences a while ago and i and i
 
03:01:31.750 --> 03:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't remember the outcome i think when
 
03:01:33.349 --> 03:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
it was originally developed it was it
 
03:01:34.790 --> 03:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
03:01:36.950 --> 03:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
the structure of the law was predicated
 
03:01:39.269 --> 03:01:39.279 align:start position:0%
upon examination-based positions which
 
03:01:41.190 --> 03:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
we have very few of anymore
 
03:01:44.309 --> 03:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
um and so let me look into that
 
03:01:47.910 --> 03:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh senator daniels thank you we're
 
03:01:50.070 --> 03:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
seeing seeing numerous bills come
 
03:01:51.990 --> 03:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
through the legislature and through this
 
03:01:54.230 --> 03:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
committee numerous requests for
 
03:01:56.630 --> 03:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
establishing new positions to what
 
03:01:59.510 --> 03:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
extent is das approving
 
03:02:02.230 --> 03:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
the establishment of new positions as
 
03:02:04.950 --> 03:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to looking at the vacancies that
 
03:02:07.510 --> 03:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
exist in changing those vacancies over
 
03:02:07.520 --> 03:02:08.550 align:start position:0%
exist in changing those vacancies over
to

03:02:08.550 --> 03:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:02:08.560 --> 03:02:10.309 align:start position:0%
to
positions

03:02:10.309 --> 03:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:02:11.750 --> 03:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't would not establish new
 
03:02:11.760 --> 03:02:12.950 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't would not establish new
ones

03:02:12.950 --> 03:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
ones
 
03:02:15.590 --> 03:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
a couple things the the quick answer to
 
03:02:16.950 --> 03:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
that is new positions are approved by
 
03:02:19.269 --> 03:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
the legislature not by um not by
 
03:02:21.349 --> 03:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
administrators so i have an
 
03:02:22.870 --> 03:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
administrative function not a policy
 
03:02:25.910 --> 03:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
function um so you approve positions um
 
03:02:28.070 --> 03:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
i i don't i process them
 
03:02:30.389 --> 03:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
um so that's one thing secondly
 
03:02:33.030 --> 03:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
um the repurposing of vacant
 
03:02:35.190 --> 03:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
vacant positions is a difficult thing
 
03:02:36.950 --> 03:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's meant to be difficult right the the
 
03:02:39.190 --> 03:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
budget is approved on a position basis
 
03:02:40.950 --> 03:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
you approve the expenditure of money for
 
03:02:42.710 --> 03:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
a specific purpose
 
03:02:45.429 --> 03:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
you may hire 14 electricians you can't
 
03:02:47.030 --> 03:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
say oh i got them to approve 14
 
03:02:48.389 --> 03:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
electricians now i'm going to convert
 
03:02:50.230 --> 03:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
them all to accountants
 
03:02:51.990 --> 03:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
and and because that's a that becomes a
 
03:02:54.070 --> 03:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
policy decision and i end up going
 
03:02:55.910 --> 03:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
before committee and senator morris goes
 
03:02:57.510 --> 03:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
oh i didn't say you could do that and
 
03:02:59.830 --> 03:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
then i'm in trouble so
 
03:03:01.990 --> 03:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
however um you know there are elements
 
03:03:04.230 --> 03:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
of 21g that suggested that managers are
 
03:03:05.349 --> 03:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
meant to manage that you're supposed to
 
03:03:06.309 --> 03:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
run your department the way you're
 
03:03:08.870 --> 03:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to manage it and um
 
03:03:10.550 --> 03:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
and there's a reclassification process
 
03:03:11.910 --> 03:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's outlined in the rules it's a
 
03:03:14.389 --> 03:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
fairly cumbersome process and it and it
 
03:03:16.710 --> 03:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
it anticipates you taking an individual
 
03:03:16.720 --> 03:03:18.230 align:start position:0%
it anticipates you taking an individual
position

03:03:18.230 --> 03:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:03:18.240 --> 03:03:19.349 align:start position:0%
position
um

03:03:19.349 --> 03:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:21.510 --> 03:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
filling out paperwork to convert it but
 
03:03:25.349 --> 03:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
our job as a uh as our regulatory
 
03:03:28.150 --> 03:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
function personnel's regulatory function
 
03:03:30.309 --> 03:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
is to look at the paperwork you you do
 
03:03:31.429 --> 03:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
as a department let's say you're an
 
03:03:33.990 --> 03:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
agency you do as an agency and make sure
 
03:03:35.830 --> 03:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
that the position you're creating is
 
03:03:37.990 --> 03:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately classified that based on
 
03:03:39.670 --> 03:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
the job duties you outline that as an
 
03:03:42.070 --> 03:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
administrator too it's not a
 
03:03:43.750 --> 03:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
project manager for whatever the
 
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
classifications are and that you've
 
03:03:47.990 --> 03:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
selected the appropriate pay range and
 
03:03:49.990 --> 03:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
that when that paperwork is done it
 
03:03:52.309 --> 03:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
meshes in the in the grid
 
03:03:55.349 --> 03:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
it is not our role responsibility or
 
03:03:58.230 --> 03:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
authority frankly to guess whether
 
03:03:59.830 --> 03:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
that's a legitimate business need of
 
03:04:01.990 --> 03:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
yours or not that is a discussion
 
03:04:04.389 --> 03:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
between you as an agency head and the
 
03:04:06.070 --> 03:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
legislature and the governor
 
03:04:08.309 --> 03:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
um our job is merely to uh is a
 
03:04:11.110 --> 03:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
ministerial function as opposed to a um
 
03:04:13.510 --> 03:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh approval function i don't have policy
 
03:04:16.790 --> 03:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:19.510 --> 03:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
03:04:23.190 --> 03:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
i do have one comment um
 
03:04:25.750 --> 03:04:25.760 align:start position:0%

already today
 
03:04:33.429 --> 03:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
