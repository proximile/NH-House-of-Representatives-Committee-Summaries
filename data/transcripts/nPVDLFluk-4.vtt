00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 align:start position:0%

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 align:start position:0%
we do that I'd ask you to please join me
 
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
 
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
United States of America and to the
 
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands
 
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
one nation under God indivisible with
 
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
and again I'd like to thank all of you
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%

00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
attending this this hearing
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh just a few remarks I'd like to make
 
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
before we get underway
 
00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:51.419 align:start position:0%
whether you intend to speak or simply to
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
observe or provide model support for
 
00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:55.979 align:start position:0%
someone who is speaking here today we do
 
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
appreciate your attendance
 
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
we have two bills for which we'll be
 
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:01.860 align:start position:0%
hearing testimony
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
as is the case with all of the bills
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
that come before the legislature these
 
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
are important and citizen input is very
 
00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.650 align:start position:0%
are important and citizen input is very
valuable

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
before I open the first hearing I'd like
 
00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
to explain how we will proceed
 
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
it has become the established practice
 
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
of this committee to recognize the main
 
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill and give them a
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
flexible amount of time to explain the
 
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
background of the bill
 
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
why it was introduced and so forth
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
after the main sponsor speaks and has
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
finished answering questions everyone
 
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039 align:start position:0%
who has completed a pink card is
 
00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:38.099 align:start position:0%
recognized one by one
 
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fairness and in order to
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
ensure that everyone has an equal
 
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
we have a time limit for each person
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
thereafter of three minutes
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
this time limit will be enforced
 
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.910 align:start position:0%
this time limit will be enforced
strictly

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
strictly
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
when you have spoken for two minutes and
 
00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
45 seconds I will advise you that you
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
have 15 seconds and to begin wrapping up
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
your remarks
 
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
at the end of three minutes I will ask
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
if you are accepting questions from the
 
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
committee members and if you are I will
 
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
then ask the committee members if they
 
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
have any questions
 
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
when the committee is finished asking
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
questions of one individual we will then
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
move on to the next person and the next
 
00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:19.019 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
well three minutes may not seem like a
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
very long period of time it is the best
 
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
way for us to give every one of you an
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
equal chance to speak
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
I would ask all of you to please be
 
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
respectful of one another while someone
 
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
is speaking and the words you choose
 
00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
I know that there are strong feelings on
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
all sides of the legislation we are
 
00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:39.959 align:start position:0%
considering here today
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
although there may be disagreement let
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
there not be disrespect
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
finally in keeping with decorum
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
especially here in the house chamber
 
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
please do not share or jeer or clap in
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
response to the testimony you hear
 
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
Plex also reminded me that a gentlemen
 
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
are wearing hats please remove them
 
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
again it's a matter of the decorum of
 
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
the house chamber
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
now the first bill for us to consider
 
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
today is House Bill 619 and I would like
 
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
to recognize representative boy the
 
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor to introduce this bill
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative Roy
 
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you members
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you members of
 
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
the public to come out for the this
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
important discussion my name is
 
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
representative Roy I represent
 
00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:44.339 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 31.
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
I brought this bill at the request of
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
parents in my district
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
at least five different sets of parents
 
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
came to me a year ago and asked me to
 
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
bring this bill
 
00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:57.660 align:start position:0%
I was very hesitant to bring this bill
 
00:10:59.329 --> 00:10:59.339 align:start position:0%
because I knew of the controversy that
 
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
it would cause
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
what sealed that for me was when I got a
 
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
call from a doctor in my district
 
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
and that doctor asked me to bring this
 
00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:09.899 align:start position:0%
bill as well
 
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
I bring this bill not with the intention
 
00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:15.779 align:start position:0%
that it will necessarily end up as
 
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
Banning these procedures I bring this
 
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:20.220 align:start position:0%
bill with the intention that we have
 
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
something that heretofore we have not
 
00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:24.899 align:start position:0%
been able to have and that's a public
 
00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:28.279 align:start position:0%
discussion about these treatments
 
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
heretofore parents who have tried to
 
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
bring it up at school boards or with
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
medical professionals have been shut
 
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:37.740 align:start position:0%
down canceled threatened
 
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
and the same goes for doctors I got an
 
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
email from a doctor a prestigious doctor
 
00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:45.779 align:start position:0%
in this state who told me that he
 
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
supported the bill but was afraid to
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
come forward because he might lose his
 
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.650 align:start position:0%
come forward because he might lose his
position

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:53.700 align:start position:0%
in this country we should be able to
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
have a rational discussion about what is
 
00:11:58.970 --> 00:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
best for our children without people
 
00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:04.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:07.700 align:start position:0%
this treatment and gender affirming care
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
for children
 
00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:14.459 align:start position:0%
is a relatively new area of Medicine
 
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
it's not proven it's debated in country
 
00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
after country no one is exactly sure
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
what is best no one is sure the
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
long-term effects
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
but what we are sure of
 
00:12:32.569 --> 00:12:32.579 align:start position:0%
is when someone goes with it and takes
 
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
it to its fullest extent they cannot go
 
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.870 align:start position:0%
it to its fullest extent they cannot go
back

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
every day we hear new stories of people
 
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
who started this process as children and
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to de-transition
 
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
and at that point all the medical and
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
support groups that were there for them
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
to transition are no longer there
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
and since their parents have been
 
00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
alienated when they were left out of the
 
00:12:57.889 --> 00:12:57.899 align:start position:0%
discussion they don't even have them
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
and the toughest question for this
 
00:13:02.329 --> 00:13:02.339 align:start position:0%
legislature and we as a public to answer
 
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
is when a young girl or a young boy
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
comes forward when they reach adulthood
 
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
and they ask how do I get my breasts
 
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.449 align:start position:0%
and they ask how do I get my breasts
back

00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:11.459 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
how can I have babies now that I'm
 
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.329 align:start position:0%
how can I have babies now that I'm
sterile

00:13:14.329 --> 00:13:14.339 align:start position:0%
sterile
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
we need to have these conversations and
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
if this bill was the only way for us to
 
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
have this debate in discussion and then
 
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
so be it
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
if it turns out that this gender
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
affirming care is the best thing for our
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
children then prove it and then it will
 
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
be so
 
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
but if it can't be proven then we need
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
to put a pause on it before we do damage
 
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
to our children that we cannot repair
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
the different parts of the bill speak
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
for themselves I will be submitting a
 
00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:47.459 align:start position:0%
detailed testimony online that's all of
 
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
your time I'm going to take today and I
 
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
won't be taking any questions on this
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.690 --> 00:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
okay what I'm going to be as we proceed
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
with a testimony from other individuals
 
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:04.220 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to do is call up a person
 
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
and after that and I'm gone also at the
 
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
same time announce the person who will
 
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
be speaking after them so that that
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
person who will be speaking next will be
 
00:14:14.329 --> 00:14:14.339 align:start position:0%
able to stop moving near a microphone
 
00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
and again to expedite the proceedings
 
00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:18.530 align:start position:0%
and again to expedite the proceedings
today

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:20.459 align:start position:0%
next up to speak is representative
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
good morning I rise in support of the
 
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.449 align:start position:0%
good morning I rise in support of the
bill

00:14:29.449 --> 00:14:29.459 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
first off I off I just want to tell
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
everyone that we don't hate anybody here
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
we have great concerns for the kids
 
00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:42.779 align:start position:0%
I have family members who identify as
 
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:44.220 align:start position:0%
the opposite sex
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
I myself was a tomboy when I was a kid
 
00:14:48.769 --> 00:14:48.779 align:start position:0%
and I outgrew it
 
00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
I also want to mention
 
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
a woman named Renee Jacks who was born a
 
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:54.710 align:start position:0%
a woman named Renee Jacks who was born a
male

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
male
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
I met her and her story broke my heart
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
she's been taking artificial hormones
 
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
hormones for well over 30 years now she
 
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
still has to shave every morning so she
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like a man
 
00:15:08.569 --> 00:15:08.579 align:start position:0%
the hormones are wreaking havoc on her
 
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
body because it's so unnatural I I can
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
it would take a long time to tell all
 
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
the things that have happened to her her
 
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.210 align:start position:0%
the things that have happened to her her
body

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:17.220 align:start position:0%
body
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
from this from these artificial hormones
 
00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:22.019 align:start position:0%
but you can look her up when you have
 
00:15:23.569 --> 00:15:23.579 align:start position:0%
time so I don't want to take up too much
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
time Renee Jax is her name she's also an
 
00:15:26.279 --> 00:15:28.310 align:start position:0%
time Renee Jax is her name she's also an
author

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
author
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
and I won't be taking any questions I
 
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
have to get back to my own committee
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Narda
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
next step to speak is Dr simran Baal to
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
good morning honorable members of the
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
committee my name is simran ball I live
 
00:15:59.689 --> 00:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
in Hanover New Hampshire I am a
 
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
physician and a member of the American
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
College of Physicians New Hampshire
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
Governor's Council and the New Hampshire
 
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
Medical Society and today I'm here to
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
testify in strong opposition to hb619 my
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
testimony also represents that of the
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
two organizations that I have mentioned
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
which also oppose this bill
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
today I'm testifying that as a doctor
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'm highly concerned about the
 
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
repercussions of this bill in terms of
 
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
the effect that it may have on New
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's youth as a physician one of
 
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
the best parts of my job has been caring
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
for people of all walks of life and I
 
00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:37.139 align:start position:0%
wanted to just share one small anecdote
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
from my time in medical training when I
 
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
was early in residency I was working in
 
00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
the emergency room and took care of a
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
young adult transgender patient who was
 
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
coming in with blood kind of seeping
 
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
through the long sleeves of their shirt
 
00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
and from their jeans and after examining
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
and talking to this patient we learned
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
that this patient had had severe
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideation from shame and
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
bullying that they had experienced in
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
not having supportive social
 
00:17:06.169 --> 00:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
environments and supported family
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
structures to me that was just
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
incredibly like unfathomable and
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking and it represents to me
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
what happens too often which is that
 
00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
transgender youth are not able to access
 
00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
supportive social environments and have
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
difficulties accessing gender affirming
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
care and this results in anxiety
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
depression higher rates of homelessness
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
and higher rates of self-harm rates of
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
suicide are as high as 40 percent in
 
00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:34.919 align:start position:0%
transgender use which means that if
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
there are a hundred people in this room
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
imagine that 40 of us would have
 
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide to me that is again
 
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.010 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide to me that is again
heartbreaking

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes to ban gender
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
affirming care it would ban those
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
supportive social structures in school
 
00:17:51.169 --> 00:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
and it would legalize conversion therapy
 
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
and thus it would exacerbate the health
 
00:17:54.529 --> 00:17:54.539 align:start position:0%
care disparities that I've already
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
pointed out I want you to imagine for a
 
00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
moment putting yourself in my shoes as a
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
physician or as a parent a teacher and
 
00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
remembering kind of that pain that you
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
may experience if some child's life ends
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
too early because of suicide due to the
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
harms that this bill propagates I do
 
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
want to point out it doesn't need to be
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
this way at all in medicine we follow
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
very careful evidence-based protocols
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
that show us the importance of accepting
 
00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:24.419 align:start position:0%
transgender identities that also involve
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
the use of medications which were
 
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
carefully used to put a temporary pause
 
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
on puberty these physical changes that
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
happen to youth can be distressing and
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
it allows us to temporarily halt those
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
changes we've also notably used these
 
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
medications for the past 30 years to
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
help children who are diagnosed with the
 
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
early onset of puberty or Central
 
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
precocious puberty I also want to point
 
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
out that there are studies Studies by
 
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
recognize that point out in large
 
00:18:58.970 --> 00:18:58.980 align:start position:0%
cohorts that accessing these medications
 
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
is really crucial and is associated with
 
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
lower odds of suicide I think with that
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
I want to go ahead and close but just
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
recognize that this bill would put
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
medical decisions into the hands of
 
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
government rather than between the
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
patient family and physician
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you are you taking questions
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
any questions from committee members yes
 
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sitting on thank you representative
 
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.010 align:start position:0%
I'm sitting on thank you representative
Barber

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair we're all getting
 
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
used to the space
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
which is not our normal home
 
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
um would would you please could I ask
 
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
you a bit about what kind of Parental
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
involvement there is when you see a
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
minor who wants this kind of treatment
 
00:19:59.930 --> 00:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so much so I think when I
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
see patients in clinic there are two
 
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
sides of the spectrum I think one side
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
is that we really carefully want the
 
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
child to have all of the supports in
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
their life that help them make this
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
decision and that can be parental role
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
models who often accompany them to
 
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
appointments and help them step by step
 
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
think through this decision on the other
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
hand we often encounter patients who may
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
not be supportive and in that case the
 
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
child turns to other trusted role models
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
in their life like teachers peers and
 
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
others in the community who are leaders
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
so I worry that not accessing those
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
supportive social supports will mean
 
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
difficulties in accessing care and going
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
through a potential transition
 
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
other questions from committee members
 
00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
yes representative Murphy I believe it
 
00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
is thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned the
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
medications are reversible is there a
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
time Beyond which they are not
 
00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
reversible once they are started that's
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
a good question I don't believe so but I
 
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
can look into that more definitively and
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
get back to you we use them often for
 
00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:06.539 align:start position:0%
children who have had early onset of
 
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
puberty and so we wait you know a number
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
of years until that time of puberty like
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
is like to catch up like if they went
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
through puberty at age six for example
 
00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
waiting until age 12 but I can get more
 
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
like definitive information to you too
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question so obviously you know
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
a person who's going through this
 
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of confusion
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
and you talk about the bullying as well
 
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
um so could you maybe describe for the
 
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
community the process that you take to
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
go through to decide this is going to be
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
the decision because for some it may be
 
00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:48.299 align:start position:0%
seen as an easy way out so what what's
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
the process that you go through to kind
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
of get this is the road we have to take
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so much for the question
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
I think when we think about transition
 
00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
we recognize that it is not an easy
 
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
decision to make and we look for
 
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
sustained kind of evidence where a child
 
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
really feels that they were not born
 
00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
into the right body that fits their
 
00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
gender identity going back years often
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
patients that I've seen in clinic will
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
report that this began in childhood and
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
that the people around them felt like
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
they could not listen to them for
 
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
example or that they felt unsafe in
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
bringing these concerns out so we listen
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
to that narrative and we help patients
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
sort of sort of understand the Journey
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
of where it began and I think the other
 
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
parts too is that we typically have a
 
00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
number of different office visits where
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
we talk through this and we think about
 
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
other like comorbidities for example
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
anxiety depression things like that that
 
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
may make it harder to transition as well
 
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.850 align:start position:0%
may make it harder to transition as well
follow-up

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
um so part of your testimony said we
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
really don't want to have the
 
00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
legislature involved in this but from
 
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
like medical rules and I'm not a doctor
 
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
so but medical rules and practice are
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
these kind of is this process defined or
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
is this pretty much different you know
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
doctor or doctor or is it a defined
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
protocol thank you so much for the
 
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
question again and I think that this is
 
00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
why it's so helpful that we are having
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
this discussion because it really is an
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
evidence-based process we utilize
 
00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:26.220 align:start position:0%
guidance from the American Academy of
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics which is well recognized and
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
the endocrine Society itself which also
 
00:23:33.289 --> 00:23:33.299 align:start position:0%
put like publishes protocols that help
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
us think through the transition that may
 
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
be medical involving hormone-based
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
medications and the psychological
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
transition but we use well-recognized
 
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
evidence to make the decision and to go
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
through the process it's not like an
 
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
individual making these decisions it's
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
really a body of evidence in the medical
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:24:00.409 --> 00:24:00.419 align:start position:0%
any other questions for committee
 
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
members okay thank you very much
 
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
okay next step to speak is Dr Wankel to
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.409 --> 00:24:30.419 align:start position:0%
uh good morning to the members of the
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
House Health and Human Services
 
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:34.919 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Brett Wankel I'm a
 
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
resident physician of internal medicine
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
and I live in Lebanon New Hampshire I'm
 
00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:42.539 align:start position:0%
here to testify strongly in opposition
 
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
to hb619
 
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
prior to becoming a physician I was a
 
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
volunteer with the Trevor Project an
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
organization dedicated to preventing
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
suicide and gay and trans youth as
 
00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:55.820 align:start position:0%
you've heard by now
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
40 percent of transgender individuals
 
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
report a history of suicide attempts
 
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
within this group those who are rejected
 
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
by their families and their communities
 
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.059 align:start position:0%
and those who are deprived opportunities
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
to transition are even more likely to
 
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
attempt suicide
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
these are ramifications I'm sadly
 
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
however transgender individuals who are
 
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
received with acceptance and support are
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
protected and experience severe mental
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
illness and attempt suicide at lower
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
rates in a country where deaths of
 
00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:36.299 align:start position:0%
Despair are rising among young people we
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
should not codify their isolation and
 
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
limit doctors abilities to help
 
00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:44.039 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are asking why not
 
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
wait until adulthood the answer is
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
simple gender incongruence typically
 
00:25:51.649 --> 00:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
presents during adolescence if not
 
00:25:51.659 --> 00:25:52.669 align:start position:0%
presents during adolescence if not
earlier

00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
this bill would restrict both education
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
and health care for young people when
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
they need it
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
this bill as it stands will Outlaw best
 
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
practice medicine and would punish
 
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
Physicians who attempt to give their
 
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:06.830 align:start position:0%
Physicians who attempt to give their
patients

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
the best care possible
 
00:26:12.409 --> 00:26:12.419 align:start position:0%
these standards are not experimental but
 
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
are established by the Pediatric
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
endocrine Society the American Academy
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
of Pediatrics and the academic Pediatric
 
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
Association based on a synthesis of data
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
in gender affirming care
 
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
while this bill highlights the risk of
 
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
medication it overlooks the benefits as
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
well as the risks in action poses
 
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
it is up to patients and their doctors
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
to determine the best path forward
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
this legislation will remove a central
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
pillar of the American Health Care
 
00:26:45.409 --> 00:26:45.419 align:start position:0%
System autonomy
 
00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:47.940 align:start position:0%
many adolescents possess the requisite
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
insight to participate meaningfully in
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
informed medical discussions and
 
00:26:54.409 --> 00:26:54.419 align:start position:0%
participate in their health care
 
00:26:54.419 --> 00:26:55.789 align:start position:0%
participate in their health care
decisions

00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:55.799 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
this would take away this decision from
 
00:27:00.169 --> 00:27:00.179 align:start position:0%
patients and families and leave it with
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:03.779 align:start position:0%
this is not only bad medicine but it is
 
00:27:06.169 --> 00:27:06.179 align:start position:0%
an infringement of Liberty
 
00:27:09.049 --> 00:27:09.059 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time I'll try to
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
answer questions if there are any
 
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Doctor any questions from
 
00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:18.140 align:start position:0%
committee members representative Shapiro
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
taking this question my understanding is
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
that the predominant
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
um medical or surgical intervention
 
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
would be puberty blockers before age 18
 
00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:36.419 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if um you're aware of
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
research about the long-term effects of
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers and if you are if you
 
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
would be able to comment on it and
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
forward that information to the
 
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
committee uh so I'm not off the top of
 
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
my head intimately familiar with the the
 
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
research as Dr ball highlighted in these
 
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers have been used for
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
decades and children in the treatment of
 
00:28:03.409 --> 00:28:03.419 align:start position:0%
central precocious puberty and it's not
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
believed that there are long-term
 
00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:07.210 align:start position:0%
believed that there are long-term
irreversible

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:07.220 align:start position:0%
irreversible
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
consequences for delaying puberty
 
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
any other questions from committee
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
members I see none okay thank you very
 
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
much sir thank you
 
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
next up to speak is Dr Conway to be
 
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
followed by representative Murray
 
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
good morning honorable members of the
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Heather Conway and
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
I live in Enfield New Hampshire I'm here
 
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
today to testify in strong opposition to
 
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.789 align:start position:0%
today to testify in strong opposition to
hb619

00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
hb619
 
00:28:39.649 --> 00:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
I will be testifying today as a
 
00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
physician as a New Hampshire resident
 
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
and as a sibling of a transgender person
 
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
about my concern for the potential
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
negative consequences of this bill on
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
transgender Youth and all those that
 
00:28:51.409 --> 00:28:51.419 align:start position:0%
care for them
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
it's a well-known Trope that every
 
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
unhappy family is unhappy in their own
 
00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
way growing up much to my regret now I
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
would have described a lot of my
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
family's unhappiness to my brother's
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
Behavior he had so much internalized and
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
externalized anger that my parents and I
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
just could not understand
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
he would get into trouble at school and
 
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
I would see the distress in my parents
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
faces as they tried to help him well we
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
did not realize then was that every time
 
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:17.700 align:start position:0%
we called him by his birth name or he
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
was instructed to go change in the wrong
 
00:29:21.889 --> 00:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
locker room we were compounding his
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
Indescribable hurt Indescribable because
 
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
none of us had the language that we
 
00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.169 align:start position:0%
none of us had the language that we
needed

00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
when my brother came out as trans a few
 
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
years later and started receiving gender
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
affirming care the transition within my
 
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
whole family was equally Indescribable
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
he is so much happier now and more
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable in his own skin but I can't
 
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
help to wonder how different things
 
00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
might have been if he didn't have to
 
00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
first suffer through all of those years
 
00:29:48.529 --> 00:29:48.539 align:start position:0%
this is just anecdotal data from my own
 
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
personal experience but now as a
 
00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
physician I practice evidence-based
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
medicine and what the evidence shows us
 
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
is that providing gender affirming care
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
to trans youths saves lives
 
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
you've already heard the studies
 
00:30:03.889 --> 00:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
conducted by the American Academy of
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics have found a significant
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
reduction in moderate and severe
 
00:30:09.769 --> 00:30:09.779 align:start position:0%
depression and a significant reduction
 
00:30:12.529 --> 00:30:12.539 align:start position:0%
in suicidality among transgender and
 
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
non-binary youth who receive puberty
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
blockers and gender-affirming care
 
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
bills such as hb619 that aim to
 
00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
legislate against LGBT education and
 
00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
safe learning environments for
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
transgender youth do not prohibit
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
Children and adolescents from the
 
00:30:30.769 --> 00:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
experience of being transgender but it
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
does limit their access to the medical
 
00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
and educational interventions that they
 
00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:35.389 align:start position:0%
and educational interventions that they
need

00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
I would like to reiterate my opposition
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
to hb619 and sincerely thank you all for
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
your time and attention and I'm happy to
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if I can
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from committee
 
00:30:46.679 --> 00:30:48.710 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from committee
members

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no questions thank you very
 
00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.029 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no questions thank you very
much

00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:54.779 align:start position:0%
next step to speak is representative
 
00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
Murray to be followed by Kearney
 
00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:03.230 align:start position:0%
Murray to be followed by Kearney
ponierney

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
Sandra Rodriguez Marine I represent
 
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
Manchester Ward 9. and I'm a trans
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
non-binary person many of you my
 
00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues may not know that
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
um yet I've been able to make good
 
00:31:18.289 --> 00:31:18.299 align:start position:0%
friends on both sides of the aisle does
 
00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
hearing this now change your perception
 
00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:22.919 align:start position:0%
of me negatively does being trans negate
 
00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
all the qualities you have seen and
 
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
appreciated me
 
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
I know for some it will as I found out
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
after tweeting about this bill yesterday
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
after saying how scared I was to be a
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
trans legislator in the New Hampshire
 
00:31:36.649 --> 00:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
state house in a time where bills like
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
this one just work to destroy me and my
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
people I received dozens of hate
 
00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
comments and emails and I'm going to
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
read one of them to you now
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
hello Alessandra you should feel lucky
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
that you are able to hold any kind of
 
00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
public office when white nationalists
 
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
take power someday and
 
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
homosexuals will not be able to hold
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
public office or be around children in
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
any capacity I submitted online
 
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
testimony today and supported the three
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
bills that will protect children from
 
00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
your degenerate filth I discuss it at
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
the link below and urge all white
 
00:32:09.169 --> 00:32:09.179 align:start position:0%
nationalists to submit testimony as well
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
and then he includes the link to the Gap
 
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
post that he made using my content to
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
encourage people to support these bills
 
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
clearly these bills enable hate they
 
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
enable violence they dehumanize and
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
ostracize trans and queer people making
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
it even harder to exist in a world that
 
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
is set against us you are not protecting
 
00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:33.539 align:start position:0%
children with these bills you are making
 
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.059 align:start position:0%
it harder for them increasing suicidal
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
ideolation and mental health struggles
 
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
it has proven that validating a child's
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
trans or queer identity can be
 
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
life-saving if you all pass this bill
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
you are saying you would rather a child
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
die than be trans
 
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
validating trans children does not mean
 
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:55.980 align:start position:0%
immediate surgery getting gender
 
00:32:57.529 --> 00:32:57.539 align:start position:0%
affirmative care is actually extremely
 
00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:00.419 align:start position:0%
difficult I am 28 years old and when I
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
tried to get a consult for Top surgery
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
it took a year to get an appointment and
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
then at that appointment I found out
 
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
insurance wouldn't cover the procedure
 
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
because I hadn't proved that I was trans
 
00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:11.269 align:start position:0%
because I hadn't proved that I was trans
enough

00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
this is me as an adult facing immense
 
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
hurdles to get the health care that I
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
deserve now imagine how much harder it
 
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
is for a child to do so
 
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:22.980 align:start position:0%

pokorny from Derry and thank you for
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
your time this morning I wanted to come
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
in today because I am a transgender man
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
and the fact is as I knew that I was
 
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:20.220 align:start position:0%
trans at the age of four years old
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
um for me going through puberty was a
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
very traumatic experience if having the
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
hormone blockers to be able to stop that
 
00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
process and not have the long-term
 
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
effects of the health that
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
having to go on to hormones and the
 
00:34:41.089 --> 00:34:41.099 align:start position:0%
cancer risk that does come from being on
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
long-term hormones if we can start
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
earlier for those that do truly know
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
that they are trans and that this was
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
not a thing that I consider this was a
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
life or death thing for me this was
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
something that had to be done I knew
 
00:34:59.810 --> 00:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
from the age of starting to be able to
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
explain who I was as a person Elementary
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
School for those that actually want to
 
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
go through this whole process of
 
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
transitioning it's never a question in
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
their mind
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
and we need to make sure that we're
 
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
being we're giving them the best
 
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
resources that we can to have a full
 
00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
healthy life
 
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
I also want to speak on the part of this
 
00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:23.579 align:start position:0%
bill that goes into
 
00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:24.170 align:start position:0%
bill that goes into
um

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
relative to sex and gender in our Public
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
Schools I think that teaching gender
 
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
identity in our Public Schools is an
 
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
important step in creating a safe and
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
inclusive learning environment for all
 
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
students gender identity education can
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
help students better understand
 
00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
themselves and their peers while also
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
providing them with the tools to
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
navigate the complexities of gender
 
00:35:50.569 --> 00:35:50.579 align:start position:0%
identity in our society the fact is that
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
this is our new reality or this next
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
generation is a lot more comfortable
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
with being gender fluid and being able
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
to not have to fit themselves into one
 
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
sex or the other and
 
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
we should we should allow that to be
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
expressed and learned about so that the
 
00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
bullying and the shame that comes from
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
that within our Public Schools is to
 
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
diminished the fact is is that this
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
argument is a losing one we are going to
 
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
continue to evolve as a society and
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
become more accepting and more accepting
 
00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
and if the house is not going to get up
 
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
with the times and this next
 
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
generation's expectations of you then
 
00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
the next generation is going to come and
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
take your seats and make sure that you
 
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
this isn't accepted so I hope that you
 
00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:45.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
next up to speak is Zachary Terrell to

trans to our family
 
00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:19.940 align:start position:0%
the least surprising thing
 
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
she could have done excuse me
 
00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.849 align:start position:0%
she could have done excuse me

um
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
two years old that we've known
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
for 13 years
 
00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
that this person in in their mind
 
00:37:53.569 --> 00:37:53.579 align:start position:0%
and and who they were
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
that may not be what they were assigned
 
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
through every interaction with this
 
00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.349 align:start position:0%
through every interaction with this
person

00:38:08.349 --> 00:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
they they chose to watch cartoons that
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
had female protagonists they loved My
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
Little Pony they chose all the sorts of
 
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
things that you might consider
 
00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
stereotypically feminine
 
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
through their whole life
 
00:38:29.569 --> 00:38:29.579 align:start position:0%
we were very supportive of that but we
 
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.140 align:start position:0%
also knew it was something that they
 
00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
held very personally
 
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
um they didn't necessarily tell their
 
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
friends that they chose to sleep in more
 
00:38:42.589 --> 00:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
of a nightgown style pajamas instead of
 
00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
the athletic shorts that their brother
 
00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:45.950 align:start position:0%
the athletic shorts that their brother
wore

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
wore
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
this has always been her reality and who
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
she is
 
00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
so when she came out last year to to my
 
00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.190 align:start position:0%
so when she came out last year to to my
parents

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
my father a blue collar worker formerly
 
00:39:09.609 --> 00:39:09.619 align:start position:0%
a firefighter a gun shop owner
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
his question was
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
can I still call you buddy and she said
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
of course
 
00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.849 align:start position:0%
of course
um

00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
so this bill
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
to me is concerning that she won't be
 
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
able to get the care right and and the
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
doctors have spoken this isn't this
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
isn't a situation where she gets to
 
00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
um you know show up at a hospital and
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
say you know give me give me gender
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
affirming care it's a process there's
 
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
there's psychologists involved there's
 
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
many many doctors involved and and we've
 
00:39:52.849 --> 00:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
been a year in this journey with her and
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
the medical
 
00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
boards uh but of 13 years of
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
experiencing it in our in our lives uh
 
00:40:02.569 --> 00:40:02.579 align:start position:0%
she's still not on puberty blockers
 
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
there's still a process there's so many
 
00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:06.980 align:start position:0%
people who have to sign off the medical
 
00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
profession takes this very serious 15
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
seconds Sir and they're very careful so
 
00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
so please consider that there's real
 
00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:17.220 align:start position:0%
people in your districts who would be
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
negatively affected if um if this bill
 
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
was to go through so thank you for your
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is if this bill were
 
00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
to pass would you feel that your rights
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
is apparent to be able to parent your
 
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
child would be infringed
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
yes I very much so
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for telling us your
 
00:40:52.079 --> 00:40:53.450 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for telling us your
story

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
story
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
other questions from committee members
 
00:40:59.930 --> 00:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing on thank you sir
 
00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
our next step to speak is Dr Leonard
 
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
small to be followed by representative
 
00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:10.190 align:start position:0%
small to be followed by representative
Granger

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
pediatrician I graduated from Dover High
 
00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
and I practiced in Dover for 34 years
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
I stand in opposition to this bill very
 
00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.470 align:start position:0%
I stand in opposition to this bill very
strongly

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
strongly
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
there are many false and misleading
 
00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
statements in this bill but two major
 
00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
areas of concern one is suicide and one
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
is the government practice in medicine
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
I won't go in more to the suicide I'm
 
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
going to written in my statement because
 
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
I think others can express that very
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
well can express the distress that they
 
00:41:44.089 --> 00:41:44.099 align:start position:0%
grow up with knowing that their identity
 
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
is different from what people want
 
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
but I think if you all think back to
 
00:41:50.569 --> 00:41:50.579 align:start position:0%
when you were two to four years old you
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
knew who you were as a person you knew
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
you're a male or a female
 
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
but just think of that knowledge was in
 
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
contradiction to what Society said and
 
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
what uh you bought your physical body
 
00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
says so that can lead to a lot of
 
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
distress and suicide and I won't go into
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
that more
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
my other concern is the government
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
practicing medicine
 
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire gave me a license to
 
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
practice medicine after acquiring
 
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
College medical school and residency
 
00:42:26.089 --> 00:42:26.099 align:start position:0%
that training and that license carried
 
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
the expectation that I would act in the
 
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
best interests of my patients relying on
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
evidence-based medicine
 
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
when faced with a problem I would rely
 
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
on a search of the literature
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
and the policies the relevant medical
 
00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.069 align:start position:0%
and the policies the relevant medical
societies

00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
societies
 
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
not doing so could subject me to
 
00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.450 align:start position:0%
not doing so could subject me to
malpractice

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
malpractice
 
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
for Trans children
 
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
evidence-based medicine is clear that
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
gender affirmative care is the standard
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
for the mental and physical well-being
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
the American Medical Association
 
00:43:00.359 --> 00:43:01.849 align:start position:0%
the American Medical Association
Association

00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:01.859 align:start position:0%

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
the American Academy of Pediatrics and
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
the American Psychiatric association all
 
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
endorse gender affirming care and
 
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
opposed government intervention
 
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
this bill forces the physician to ignore
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
or deny that standard
 
00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:20.780 align:start position:0%
it forces the physician to commit
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
malpractice in order to avoid civil
 
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.550 align:start position:0%
malpractice in order to avoid civil
penalties

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
it is a government practicing medicine
 
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.010 align:start position:0%
it is a government practicing medicine
for

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:30.020 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
non-evidence-based medicine
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
which would be unacceptable in any other
 
00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.650 align:start position:0%
which would be unacceptable in any other
situation

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
trans kids are born with a certain
 
00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:39.890 align:start position:0%
trans kids are born with a certain
identity

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
identity
 
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
they did not choose it
 
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
is who they are
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
it cannot be changed
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
much of society does not accept this
 
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
fact of medicine and science does
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
this bill these trans kids at
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
significant risk of suicide
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
this makes government not evidence the
 
00:44:02.809 --> 00:44:02.819 align:start position:0%
determinant of the standard of care
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
for the mental and physical health by
 
00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.050 align:start position:0%
for the mental and physical health by
children

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
and for the ethical well-being of our
 
00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.410 align:start position:0%
and for the ethical well-being of our
physicians

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
physicians
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
I strongly urge you to defeat this bill
 
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
and I'll think any questions thank you
 
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.809 --> 00:44:20.819 align:start position:0%
I'm saying none uh sir do you have a
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
copy of your written testimony or yep
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
thank you next up to speak is
 
00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:32.579 align:start position:0%
representative Ranger to be followed by
 
00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:35.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Michael Granger
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
representing Stratford II it is often
 
00:44:43.609 --> 00:44:43.619 align:start position:0%
said that history never repeats itself
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
but that it often Rhymes Eugenics has a
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
long and interesting history in the
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
1930s Germany had a euthanasia program
 
00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:52.740 align:start position:0%
that involved excluding the genetically
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
unfit Germans from the national
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
Community before the end of the decade
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
over 5 000 physically and mentally
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
disabled children were murdered through
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
starvation or lethal overdoses of
 
00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.430 align:start position:0%
starvation or lethal overdoses of
medication

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
medication
 
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
but in the United States at the same
 
00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
exact time the concept of euthanizing
 
00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
social undesirables was also a popular
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
idea it was almost always countered
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
however with humanitarian sentiment that
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
the lower classes shouldn't be killed
 
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
but merely prevented from breeding
 
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
this lowly logic is all the rage during
 
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
the Progressive Era after all why bother
 
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
murdering them when you can simply
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
sterilize them instead this was the
 
00:45:29.089 --> 00:45:29.099 align:start position:0%
geogenesis Viewpoint back in the day
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
from their Viewpoint that's nine tenths
 
00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:33.300 align:start position:0%
to benefit with one-tenth the risk of
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
social condemnation
 
00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
after World War II and the full horrors
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
of the Holocaust became well known and
 
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
well taught the idea that we should
 
00:45:41.569 --> 00:45:41.579 align:start position:0%
engage in any eugenic activity to
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
prevent the propagation of undesirable
 
00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
traits felt to an all-time low in
 
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
popularity the ideas themselves didn't
 
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
die however those who held on to these
 
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
Progressive ideas kept it to themselves
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
and took time to modify and adapt the
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
viewpoints and make them more marketable
 
00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
the GI generation who fought in World
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
War II is mostly dead and when a
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
generation dies Society loses memories
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
there are less than a quarter million
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
Americans Alive Now who fought in World
 
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
War II and that number is unfortunately
 
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
decreasing every day each time one of
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
these people dies Society has one less
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
person to ask about the ideas that the
 
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
generation defeated
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
we forget ideas that are incredibly
 
00:46:20.329 --> 00:46:20.339 align:start position:0%
dangerous incredibly evil and Incredibly
 
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
wrong and if we don't remember we can't
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
recognize them when they come again
 
00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
the ideas that have been sleeping since
 
00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:29.220 align:start position:0%
World War II now have an opportunity to
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
come back for there are none left who
 
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
remember them Eugenics is wrong it is
 
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
wrong to sterilize minors even if they
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
are exhibiting what some consider
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
non-gender conforming Behavior so what
 
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
if a boy thinks he's a girl children are
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
full of imaginative thoughts and if they
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
want to play pretend that is not a crime
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
let's not punish a child's creativity by
 
00:46:56.809 --> 00:46:56.819 align:start position:0%
amputating their sex organs these
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
children's are incredibly valuable their
 
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
genes are worth spreading frankly it's
 
00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
cool to take advantage of confused
 
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
adolescents and trick them into
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
destroying their lineages every single
 
00:47:08.569 --> 00:47:08.579 align:start position:0%
person alive today comes from a long
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
line of survivors every one of us had a
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
father and a mother both of them
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
survived long enough to produce
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
Offspring each of our parents also had
 
00:47:17.329 --> 00:47:17.339 align:start position:0%
parents who survived long enough to have
 
00:47:19.609 --> 00:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
kids this chain goes back for at least a
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
couple dozen years probably much longer
 
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
and each one of our ancestors survived
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
long enough to have kids kids with
 
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria are no different they
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
should not be called from the gene pool
 
00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
I repeat do not call non-gender
 
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
conforming children from the gene pool
 
00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
there's nothing wrong with a boy who
 
00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
likes baking and sewing and wearing
 
00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
dresses there's nothing wrong with a
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
girl going fishing and climbing trees
 
00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
everyone in this room engages in
 
00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
non-gender conforming behavior from time
 
00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
to time and that's okay if you truly
 
00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
care for these kids and want them to
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
have full meaningful lives don't let
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
them be castrated before they are able
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
to breed
 
00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
they deserve to have an opportunity to
 
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
have kids of their own many of them may
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
not make it and each time each one that
 
00:47:59.329 --> 00:47:59.339 align:start position:0%
is not able to contribute genetic
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
material to the future of humanity is a
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
shame but to deny them the ability to
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
even try that's just evil Eugenics is
 
00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
wrong so please OTP hb619 thank you for
 
00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
your time I'm available for questions
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay any questions from committee
 
00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:20.579 align:start position:0%
taking the question are you comparing
 
00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
the extermination of Jews and others
 
00:48:25.089 --> 00:48:25.099 align:start position:0%
with giving gender affirming care
 
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
correct both of them were attempts to
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
reduce please correct both of those were
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
attempts to remove people from the gene
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
pool both of them were genocide trans
 
00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.230 align:start position:0%
pool both of them were genocide trans
genocide

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
genocide
 
00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
as a Jew I find that hey please please
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
again no disrespect everybody had the
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
right to breathe even my enemies have a
 
00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
right to breed they disagree with me
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
they have a right to breed any other
 
00:48:48.119 --> 00:48:49.309 align:start position:0%
they have a right to breed any other
questions

00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
thank you sir

type of care to this population in

in the packet they came around I
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
provided written testimony from three

Alyssa herwertz who's this ID

as legislators you're tasked with a
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
great challenge to balance individual
 
00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
liberties and government intervention
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's a hard balance
 
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
but House Bill 619 would directly impede
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
our patients abilities and their individ
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
to access care and their individual
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
liberties it would interfere with their
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
personal freedoms
 
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:39.660 align:start position:0%

are the patients that we treat and we
see

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
as parents can you imagine not being
 
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
able to access care for your for your
 
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
kiddo that has a complex Health disease
 
00:50:54.049 --> 00:50:54.059 align:start position:0%
I can't I'm a parent of a kid who has
 
00:50:54.059 --> 00:50:55.309 align:start position:0%
I can't I'm a parent of a kid who has
one

00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
um as an adult a patient can you imagine
 
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
living in a in a state where you can't
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
access health care that you need and
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
that you want I can't imagine a state
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
our patients come to us because they're
 
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
seeking care they want and they need
 
00:51:11.329 --> 00:51:11.339 align:start position:0%
parents come to us to consent to
 
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
treatment because they want to need this
 
00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
for their kids they are trying to
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
support their children
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth house is proud to provide
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
those evidence-based care and um we work

next step to speak is Peyton Durkee to
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Peyton jerky I'm a New

of Nashua New Hampshire
 
00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:56.220 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to strongly oppose House
 
00:51:58.609 --> 00:51:58.619 align:start position:0%
Bill 619 and to explain to you why this
 
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
bill is dangerous and discriminatory for
 
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Youth and for their
 
00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:02.630 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Youth and for their
families

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
this bill claims quote only a small
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
percentage of the American population uh
 
00:52:09.049 --> 00:52:09.059 align:start position:0%
defined experiences distressed and
 
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:10.740 align:start position:0%
identifying with their biological sex in
 
00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:11.589 align:start position:0%
identifying with their biological sex in
quotes

00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
quotes
 
00:52:16.329 --> 00:52:16.339 align:start position:0%
.005 to 0.1014 of males and
 
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
.002.003 of females according to the
 
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
American Psychiatric association who
 
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:24.180 align:start position:0%
also all supports gender affirming care
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
what this bill refers to as a small
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
percentage it's actually hundreds of
 
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
thousands of transgender and gender
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
non-conforming Americans if this bill
 
00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
passes thousands of trans non-binary
 
00:52:34.849 --> 00:52:34.859 align:start position:0%
youth will be denied the medical care
 
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
they need in New Hampshire
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
why are these medical services so
 
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.309 align:start position:0%
why are these medical services so
necessary

00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
I'm looking to 2020 study from the

gender affirming care compared to youth
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
that did suicide attempts or 11.7
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
percent higher in youth that wanted this
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
care but did not receive it compared to
 
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
youth that did
 
00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
but gender affirming hormone therapy is
 
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
not the most popular form of gender
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
affirming care it's just one of the many
 
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
forms of transition that this bill is
 
00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:17.579 align:start position:0%
aiming to ban
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
the language of this bill is very
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
concerning calling young trans girls
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
children threats to their cisgender
 
00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
teammates by claiming their inclusion
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
would be quote dangerous and unfair to
 
00:53:29.329 --> 00:53:29.339 align:start position:0%
female athletes
 
00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
the safety of every single student in
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is in the hands of their
 
00:53:34.849 --> 00:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
coaches their referees their teachers
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
and their parents this bill also claims
 
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
that allowing transgender young girls to
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
participate on their preferred gender
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
teams quote diminishes female
 
00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
achievement sets back women's rights and
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
denies cisgender girls their recognition
 
00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
this blatantly discriminatory saying in
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
so many words that transgender young
 
00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:53.339 align:start position:0%
women and girls and their athletic
 
00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:55.140 align:start position:0%
achievements are not to be considered
 
00:53:57.290 --> 00:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
legitimate or real like their cisgender
 
00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:58.370 align:start position:0%
legitimate or real like their cisgender
teammates

00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
teammates
 
00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
and claims their personal achievements
 
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
take away from or harm the subsist
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
gender girls this is not true women's
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
rights include transgender women's
 
00:54:08.089 --> 00:54:08.099 align:start position:0%
rights trans women and trans young girls
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
are not a threat to cisgender women
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
trans youth in New Hampshire deserve
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
medical autonomy over their bodies
 
00:54:17.569 --> 00:54:17.579 align:start position:0%
modern medicine has made so many
 
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
evidence-based gender affirming
 
00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
procedures safe and successful and more
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
accessible unless this bill were to pass
 
00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:26.339 align:start position:0%
it's up to trans kids their parents and
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
their trusted medical professionals to
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
make these age-appropriate decisions
 
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
that are in the children's best interest
 
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:34.140 align:start position:0%
the government should have no
 
00:54:35.809 --> 00:54:35.819 align:start position:0%
the government should have nothing to do
 
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
with these personal medical choices and
 
00:54:39.049 --> 00:54:39.059 align:start position:0%
this bill will strip these freedoms of
 
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire kids and their families it
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
does not need to exist in the state
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
gender affirming Health Care has and
 
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
will continue to save young lives thank
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
you and I am accepting questions if you
 
00:54:52.849 --> 00:54:52.859 align:start position:0%
have any thank you any questions
 
00:54:57.530 --> 00:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
next up to speak is Vivian Murphy to be
 
00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:55:09.049 --> 00:55:09.059 align:start position:0%
my name is Vivian Murphy I stand today
 
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill and I speak
 
00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
from my personal experience as a trans
 
00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:16.010 align:start position:0%
from my personal experience as a trans
woman

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
woman
 
00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
first we were considered deviants
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
dressing as women only to gain access to
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
female spaces to inflict harm
 
00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
then we wanted to engage in women's
 
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
sports so we could steal their
 
00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:28.309 align:start position:0%
sports so we could steal their
accomplishments

00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
accomplishments
 
00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
now we have child abusers for wanting to
 
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:32.339 align:start position:0%
create a more comfortable path to
 
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
Wellness rather than the confused and
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
heart-wrenching ordeal that we as adult
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
trans people were forced to endure
 
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:43.140 align:start position:0%
who comes next why is our experience so
 
00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
through our existence so threatening
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
have the people proposing these
 
00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:50.700 align:start position:0%
uninformed and mean-spirited laws ever
 
00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
met a trans person or a child
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
where does their authority to impose
 
00:55:57.049 --> 00:55:57.059 align:start position:0%
pain reside
 
00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
where is their compassion and morality
 
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
it was once believed that women's bodies
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
were too fragile to ride in a locomotive
 
00:56:08.589 --> 00:56:08.599 align:start position:0%
the blacks lacked intelligence to vote
 
00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
gays were child Predators Mexicans were
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
lazy etc
 
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:14.390 align:start position:0%
lazy etc
etc

00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
etc
 
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.230 align:start position:0%
etc
etc

00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
etc
 
00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
all these beliefs have been proven false
 
00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
I quote the voice of the majority is no
 
00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
proof of justice for a direct shower
 
00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:26.569 align:start position:0%
proof of justice for a direct shower
philosopher

00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:26.579 align:start position:0%
philosopher
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
loss to force de transitioning have been
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
passed in South Dakota and Tennessee
 
00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
there are hundreds of anti-transgender
 
00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
laws being composed around the country
 
00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
motivate motivated by fear or worse yet
 
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
by people who are willing at all costs
 
00:56:45.049 --> 00:56:45.059 align:start position:0%
to maintain power and position
 
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
the rights of parents to seek
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
life-saving medically appropriate health
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
care for their child and being trampled
 
00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
medical evidence is being attacked
 
00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
mocked and ignored anyone trying to help
 
00:56:59.450 --> 00:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
these trans kids are being labeled as
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
groomers what does that mean why are
 
00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
these people that knew such things and
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
why are there tiny numbers with loud
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
branched self-righteous voices being
 
00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
listened to
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
when this is in when we crawl back in
 
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
our holes and suffer in silence because
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
some are uncomfortable by our presence
 
00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
we do not identify as women or men we
 
00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
are women men or even sometimes we fall
 
00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
in between
 
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
this is not a choice it's an innate
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge of who we are that is carried
 
00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
from birth at 72 I have never had one
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
moment where I have felt comfortable as
 
00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:39.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:42.300 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
okay Banning something is the argument
 
00:57:48.049 --> 00:57:48.059 align:start position:0%
of the uneducated or bigoted mind
 
00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.220 align:start position:0%
compassion and empathy is where the
 
00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
majority of society resides
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
we've been here before women blacks Jews
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
gays every ethnic group that has come to
 
00:57:59.809 --> 00:57:59.819 align:start position:0%
our Shores and those that were here
 
00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:02.220 align:start position:0%
before us have all been demonized
 
00:58:04.329 --> 00:58:04.339 align:start position:0%
dehumanized legislated against
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
physically attacked and emotionally
 
00:58:06.599 --> 00:58:08.089 align:start position:0%
physically attacked and emotionally
tortured

00:58:08.089 --> 00:58:08.099 align:start position:0%
tortured
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
the fourth time I've come to Concord to
 
00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
testify on trans issues
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
this bill does not affect me personally
 
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
but having lived through the guilt shame
 
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
and hopelessness of being trans growing
 
00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
up in the 50s and sadly still today I
 
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
want these kids to receive the dignity
 
00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
and care that modern medicine and
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
enlightened social awareness makes
 
00:58:28.079 --> 00:58:29.690 align:start position:0%
enlightened social awareness makes
possible

00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
to remove and criminalize the right of
 
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
self-determination to be who you truly
 
00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
are what is the real child of news here
 
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
sorry please wrap up my voice my beard
 
00:58:44.809 --> 00:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
my body shape my male features are all
 
00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
on display bringing unwanted attention
 
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
and threats I'm willing to endure this
 
00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:51.180 align:start position:0%
as judgment
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
to live the life I only dreamed of cried
 
00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
about as a child I had to hide from the
 
00:58:59.329 --> 00:58:59.339 align:start position:0%
world and adopt a false Persona just to
 
00:59:02.329 --> 00:59:02.339 align:start position:0%
be safe from school and ridicule and
 
00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
harm being transgender is nothing new we
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
have always existed the evidence is
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
there if you look we are simply a small
 
00:59:11.329 --> 00:59:11.339 align:start position:0%
portion of the Human Condition with
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
every right to exist and flourish okay

you ever written testimony you want to
 
00:59:27.049 --> 00:59:27.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:28.849 --> 00:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
next up is the Reverend Eliza Tweedy to
 
00:59:42.289 --> 00:59:42.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
sorry I thought I hit that already I'm
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
here to stand in opposition to House
 
00:59:50.089 --> 00:59:50.099 align:start position:0%
Bill 619. the house bill is full of
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
Faith language so I respond in kind
 
00:59:55.849 --> 00:59:55.859 align:start position:0%
the disciple Philip one day in the
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
earliest days of the church encountered
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
an Ethiopian eunuch studying scripture
 
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
now the unit would not have been allowed
 
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
into the worship space because of
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
cultural perceptions around his gender
 
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:08.460 align:start position:0%
and sexuality does that sound familiar
 
01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:09.710 align:start position:0%
and sexuality does that sound familiar
y'all

01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
y'all
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
but though eunuch asked Philip what is
 
01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
to prevent me being baptized and Philip
 
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
baptized them made the eunuch a full
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
member of the body of Christ because the
 
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
ways of God the ways of Grace and love
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
aren't always the ways of humans now you
 
01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
might say that that was Philip not Jesus
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
but in Matthew 19 Jesus said that there
 
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
are eunuchs folks who fall outside of
 
01:00:38.089 --> 01:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
our gender binary by birth by choice and
 
01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
even by faith those are who are outside
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
the binary quote for the sake of the
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
Kingdom of Heaven a statement which
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
holds no condemnation in the Greek or in
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
the English
 
01:00:50.809 --> 01:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
Matthew's gospel goes on with famous
 
01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:52.859 align:start position:0%
words about how our treatment of one
 
01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
another reflects directly on our
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
relationship with God I won't quote it
 
01:00:59.809 --> 01:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
all here it's in the 25th chapter and it
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
ends with the note just as you do to the
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
least of these who are members of my
 
01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
family you did it to me now Beyond
 
01:01:08.329 --> 01:01:08.339 align:start position:0%
noting that there is no judgment
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
attached to the people whom we are
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
called to care for it's not those who
 
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
are sick unless they're Samaritans or
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
those who are hungry unless they're
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
queer it's interesting to me that Jesus
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
is calling us to love those who are
 
01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:25.859 align:start position:0%
specifically not like us to learn to be
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
in relationship with those who are not
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
like us and that there is nowhere In
 
01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
this passage a call to conversion of
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
those people
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
so I am at a loss today that we are
 
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
debating the rights of parents to keep
 
01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
their children from those relationships
 
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
the rights of the state to keep those
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
children from those relationships in the
 
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
name of the Christ who calls us to love
 
01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
now Paul reminds us in a very famous
 
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:55.140 align:start position:0%
passage that love is not arrogant or
 
01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
boastful or rude that love does not
 
01:01:59.690 --> 01:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
insist on its own way rather that love
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
seeks the truth perhaps indeed the same
 
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
truth that Jesus and Philip knew that
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
God's love cannot be confined in human
 
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
cultural understandings even about
 
01:02:12.289 --> 01:02:12.299 align:start position:0%
gender and yet we debate here today
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
about removing the right of parents to
 
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
love their children and support them in
 
01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
who they know themselves to be we debate
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
about communities loving children and
 
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
giving them the space and the safety to
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
explore who they are we pervert the
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
concept of love into something that
 
01:02:31.609 --> 01:02:31.619 align:start position:0%
would make Jesus flip tables because
 
01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
frankly creating laws that would
 
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
absolutely lead to increased rates of
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
suicide and self-harm Trauma and fear is
 
01:02:41.809 --> 01:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
anathema to the gospel
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
and the fact that it's being done in the
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
name of Christianity despite Jesus and
 
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
Philip and Paul is abhorrent
 
01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
scapegoat in one Community for the sake
 
01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
of scoring political points targeting
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people to create a monolithic
 
01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
culture has been tried
 
01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
it never ends well
 
01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
and this I know it is the mark of
 
01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
fearful not faithful people it is the
 
01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:12.299 align:start position:0%
mark of Temptation not discipleship and
 
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
Jesus never stands with those who are in
 
01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
power but always and forever with those
 
01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
who are being harmed and excluded so I
 
01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:22.940 align:start position:0%
call on you today to stand with love
 
01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
inclusion and Justice if you ever wanted
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
to say you stand with Jesus and to
 
01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
please mark this bill as itl thank you
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
so much
 
01:03:39.970 --> 01:03:39.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:45.500 align:start position:0%
are you taking questions Reverend
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman my question could be
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
answered by the clerk I just didn't get
 
01:03:52.609 --> 01:03:52.619 align:start position:0%
the name of the person who just
 
01:03:52.619 --> 01:03:54.230 align:start position:0%
the name of the person who just
testified

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
testified
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
I'm the Reverend Eliza Tweedy I'm the
 
01:03:58.970 --> 01:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
pastor of First Church Congregational in
 
01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
Rochester thank you very much and thank
 
01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
you Freda any other questions
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
next up to speak is Joy Douglas
 
01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
Robertson to be followed by James
 
01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.470 align:start position:0%
Robertson to be followed by James
Marshall

01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
hello members of the committee my name
 
01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:19.980 align:start position:0%
is Joy I'm a member for the party uh of
 
01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
the party for socialism and Liberation
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
and today I'm testifying strongly
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
against hb619 but I would note that what
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
I say speaks the entire slate of hateful
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
and reactionary Bills currently
 
01:04:31.609 --> 01:04:31.619 align:start position:0%
disgracing these Halls
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
these bills are all fundamentally about
 
01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
the same reactionary principles and
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
therefore can be addressed as one
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
massive hateful gibberish
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
firstly one of the strategies used by
 
01:04:44.569 --> 01:04:44.579 align:start position:0%
the far right is to highlight those who
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
regret transition and exceedingly low
 
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
number compared to the usual statistics
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
on operational regret and yet whereas
 
01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
the outrage over their regret rate for
 
01:04:58.250 --> 01:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
hip replacement surgeries
 
01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
where's the New York Times articles and
 
01:05:02.089 --> 01:05:02.099 align:start position:0%
the alarmist testimonials on the dangers
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
who here is aware of the fact that 97
 
01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
97 of transgender people are happy with
 
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
their decision to transition
 
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:18.299 align:start position:0%
now who here is aware that 65 percent of
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
the general population polls regretted
 
01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
their own cosmetic plastic surgery
 
01:05:26.329 --> 01:05:26.339 align:start position:0%
where is the outrage
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
we sit here in light of these facts but
 
01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
some of you want us to highlight a
 
01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
statistical anomaly they would have us
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
look at the sky and declare it made of
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
steel because they've seen a jet go by
 
01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.250 align:start position:0%
steel because they've seen a jet go by
it

01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
secondly components of this anti-trans
 
01:05:41.809 --> 01:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
bill claim to be fighting for parents
 
01:05:44.089 --> 01:05:44.099 align:start position:0%
rights and indeed what a wonderful
 
01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
Legacy to claim
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
parents race was first used to defend
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
child labor factories
 
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
and sense has been tied to every
 
01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
reactionary principle Under the Sun
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
let's not forget when parental rights
 
01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
were appealed to to combat School
 
01:05:59.030 --> 01:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
integration parental rights has always
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
been a dog whistle for the worst kind of
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
politics and has never been a vehicle
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
for protecting children which we are
 
01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
apparently all here to discuss
 
01:06:09.289 --> 01:06:09.299 align:start position:0%
we're holding all right so we are told
 
01:06:10.849 --> 01:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
that this is also about protecting
 
01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
children from grooming and this is
 
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
rather curious because I do not recall
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
the moral outrage and calls to action
 
01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
from far-right demagogues when child
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
beauty pageants were enjoying a popular
 
01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
Spotlight on reality TV shows when it
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
came to the actual sexualization of
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
children by their own parents for a cash
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
prize via giant Monopoly paycheck uh
 
01:06:32.569 --> 01:06:32.579 align:start position:0%
what do we get from these alarmists
 
01:06:32.579 --> 01:06:34.069 align:start position:0%
what do we get from these alarmists
silence

01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
silence
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's worth mentioning mentioning
 
01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
that nearly a thousand people are soon
 
01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
suing the sununu Youth Services Center
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
for childhood abuse
 
01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
and now they launch an attack against
 
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
children who are trying their best to
 
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
survive in a system that wants to
 
01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
eliminate them
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
what other hypocrisy what a transparent
 
01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
farce and first it is because at its
 
01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
root this is not actually about trans
 
01:06:57.890 --> 01:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
Identity or protecting children this
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
mockery of legislation is about one
 
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
thing it's about mobilizing cisgender
 
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
white workers against Escapo this is
 
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
about keeping the people who are people
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
separated by encouraging those without
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
power to attack those with even flesh
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
this is the causes belly of modern
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
American fascism trans people have been
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
identified as the easiest Target to keep
 
01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:22.700 align:start position:0%
us all from recognizing that our enemies
 
01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
are that our enemies are not amongst the
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
have-nots but in fact they are the
 
01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
people making Wars for profit they are
 
01:07:30.170 --> 01:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
the people withholding housing and
 
01:07:31.609 --> 01:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
health care they're the people hoarding
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
the billions and wealth that their
 
01:07:34.609 --> 01:07:34.619 align:start position:0%
workers create and the politicians
 
01:07:36.289 --> 01:07:36.299 align:start position:0%
judges and police employed to make sure
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
they can continue to do so our enemies
 
01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
are not trans people the state is
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
already bleeding teachers medical
 
01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
providers and young people in the state
 
01:07:46.490 --> 01:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
what it needs most is compassion
 
01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
community and new generations these
 
01:07:50.329 --> 01:07:50.339 align:start position:0%
bills are documents of a creeping
 
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
fascism and they must be thoroughly
 
01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
rebuked and rejected for what they are
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
okay next step to speak is um James
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.510 align:start position:0%
Marshall to be followed by Court Reed
hi

01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
hi
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
thank you chairwoman McDonald and
 
01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:12.059 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Jim
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
Marshall from Derry New Hampshire and
 
01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify against HB 619 I
 
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
specifically just
 
01:08:20.650 --> 01:08:20.660 align:start position:0%
mentioned chairwoman as he had
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
incorrectly gendered a previous speaker
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
almost 20 years ago my wife and I were
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
anxiously awaiting the birth of our
 
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
second child I was in the delivery room
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
holding the scissors to cut the
 
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
umbilical cord as the baby was born
 
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
there were no cries I looked over as the
 
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
doctor and nurse ran away with the baby
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
in their hands and a dark purple color
 
01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:43.259 align:start position:0%
I can only assume I looked at my wife
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
with a horrified look on my face
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
after a torturous few seconds went by
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
the baby began to cry I don't think I
 
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
heard the doctors tell me what the sex
 
01:08:55.249 --> 01:08:55.259 align:start position:0%
of the baby was didn't it didn't matter
 
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
I was relieved that I was alive
 
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
fast forward 13 or 14 years my youngest
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
was in eighth or ninth grade they hated
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
going out in school going out to school
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
joining groups being in public they felt
 
01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
out of place different
 
01:09:10.249 --> 01:09:10.259 align:start position:0%
it was very clear to us that this was a
 
01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
after a few weeks we went to a therapist
 
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
that specialized in depression and
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
transgender issues not once did our
 
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
after several months of this therapy we
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
just we
 
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
proceeded two trans a transgender care
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
service provider getting hormone
 
01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
treatments we noticed a marked
 
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
improvement in my in my son's care and
 
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
his mood his willingness to come out of
 
01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:46.259 align:start position:0%
his room his willingness to go to school
 
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
he actually joined groups in school
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
where he belonged because they were
 
01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:52.550 align:start position:0%
where he belonged because they were
accepted

01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
I've taken him shooting I've helped him
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
learn how to drive I've helped him with
 
01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
homework and other things parents do
 
01:09:59.209 --> 01:09:59.219 align:start position:0%
with their kids
 
01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
I sit here in front of you today without
 
01:10:03.169 --> 01:10:03.179 align:start position:0%
a single doubt in my mind
 
01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
that he would not be here today if I and
 
01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
my wife did not support him and get him
 
01:10:10.150 --> 01:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
the care that he needed
 
01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
hb619 will prevent parents from doing
 
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
what I had the ability to do
 
01:10:17.209 --> 01:10:17.219 align:start position:0%
set my trial to get the appropriate care
 
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
that they needed to continue living and
 
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
to be happy
 
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
HB 619 intentionally or not will cause
 
01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
kids to retreat Into Darkness
 
01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
or even for
 
01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
if my son went to school and they had no
 
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
clubs or groups or other gender
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
affirming rules or policies it would
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
have made this process so much more
 
01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:35.930 align:start position:0%
have made this process so much more
difficult

01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
schools are here to teach kids not only
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
the three honors but to help them become
 
01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
socially aware and productive members of
 
01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:43.729 align:start position:0%
socially aware and productive members of
society

01:10:43.729 --> 01:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
society
 
01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
we should not force someone to be an
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
outcast simply because some people fear
 
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
them or of their lives
 
01:10:53.689 --> 01:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
in regards to the so-called conversion
 
01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
therapy just like an abused spouse or
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
child believes it is their fault that
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
they are getting abused or that they did
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
something to deserve it a child
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
approached by a parent or a religious
 
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
leader will be forced to realize their
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
parents think they are defective you
 
01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
have 15 seconds so please and they will
 
01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
need to be fixed
 
01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
I think we can all agree that the vast
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
majority of children want their parents
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
to love them and understand them and
 
01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
their approval as such they have no way
 
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
to truly oppose a push by their parents
 
01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
to participate in this type of thing
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
department of justice justice statistics
 
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
show that hate crimes against the lgbtq
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
community is second only to those for
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
race and ethnicity intentional or not
 
01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
this bill will exacerbate that thank you
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
for your time I urge you to vote against
 
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
this bill if you have any questions I'll
 
01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:39.780 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer them questions from
 
01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
next up to speak is Court read to be
 
01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:06.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time my name is
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
Courtney Reed and I'm here to testify in
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
opposition to H.B 619 on behalf of the
 
01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
American civil liberties Union in New
 
01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:17.890 align:start position:0%
American civil liberties Union in New
Hampshire

01:12:17.890 --> 01:12:17.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
primarily because and as I'm sure we've
 
01:12:23.209 --> 01:12:23.219 align:start position:0%
heard already the bill would ban gender
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
affirming health care for minors would
 
01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
ban any affirmation related to being
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
transgender or non-binary in public
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
schools and the bill would functionally
 
01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
repeal the current ban on conversion
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
therapy by changing the definition in a
 
01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
way that fails to recognize the
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
coerciveness frequently inherent to this
 
01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
dangerous practice
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
I want to point out that hb619 has been
 
01:12:49.199 --> 01:12:50.689 align:start position:0%
I want to point out that hb619 has been
demonstrated

01:12:50.689 --> 01:12:50.699 align:start position:0%
demonstrated
 
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
in legislation similar to it in other
 
01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
states that have negative health effects
 
01:12:56.770 --> 01:12:56.780 align:start position:0%
on transgender youth
 
01:12:59.209 --> 01:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
we are aware that gender affirming care
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
is widely recognized as the only
 
01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
evidence-based approach to addressing
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
the health care needs of transgender
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
youth and research has found that lack
 
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
of access to gender affirming care has
 
01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
yielded poor mental health outcomes for
 
01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
transgender youth such as heightened
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
suicide societal ideation
 
01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.610 align:start position:0%
suicide societal ideation
moreover

01:13:18.610 --> 01:13:18.620 align:start position:0%
moreover
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
hb619 would make schools hostile to
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
transgender youth
 
01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
transgender youth Thrive when they're
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
affirmed in their agenda identity and we
 
01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
know that a lot of gender affirming care
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
for youth is specifically related to the
 
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
ability to socially transition
 
01:13:39.229 --> 01:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
the inability to use one's affirming
 
01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
pronouns or participate in school sports
 
01:13:44.689 --> 01:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
or use the correct bathroom or locker
 
01:13:44.699 --> 01:13:45.770 align:start position:0%
or use the correct bathroom or locker
room

01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:48.380 align:start position:0%
prompts what would be
 
01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
in a business aggressive policing of
 
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
one's gender identity to be able to
 
01:13:55.689 --> 01:13:55.699 align:start position:0%
access bases that they should be
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
entitled to
 
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
uh and evidence shows that when schools
 
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
have inclusive policies where
 
01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
transgender youth feel safe to play
 
01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
sports or access various spaces they
 
01:14:10.810 --> 01:14:10.820 align:start position:0%
report higher levels of belongingness
 
01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
hb619 also as I've said would
 
01:14:15.890 --> 01:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
functionally repeal New Hampshire's ban
 
01:14:17.930 --> 01:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
on conversion therapy which would
 
01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
inevitably put lgbtq plus granted
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
Staters at risk of abuse and coercion
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
the bill would change the definition so
 
01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
that those enrolled would only be
 
01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
considered enrolled in conversion
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
therapy if it's against their clearly
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
expressed will which makes it extremely
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
difficult to classify this harmful
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
practice as such especially with with
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
minors these just requirements are
 
01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:43.640 align:start position:0%
impossible for minors to meet
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
and the bill also undermines
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
through its attempts state and federal
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
protections that are afforded to Granite
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
Staters we have constitutional and
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
statutory protections
 
01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
for transgender individuals and those of
 
01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
the lgbtq community to be free from
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination on the basis of sex and
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
gender identity and there are federal
 
01:15:08.689 --> 01:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
protections that prevent from that
 
01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
discrimination as well and we've seen
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
these protections enacted in States like
 
01:15:17.689 --> 01:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
Arkansas in Alabama where gender
 
01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
affirming care has been blocked by the
 
01:15:22.729 --> 01:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
courts so hb619 unjustly targets
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
transgender and lgbtq and has no place
 
01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
in the granite state and I would urge
 
01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
you to oppose this Bill thank you thank
 
01:15:33.729 --> 01:15:33.739 align:start position:0%
you any questions from committee members
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
next up is a gray Dunlap to be followed
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
from Concord
 
01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
today I am not just standing here for
 
01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
myself but I'm also here to show younger
 
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
trans people out there that there are
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
people who care for you and will help
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
fight for you
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
gender affirming Health Care is
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
life-saving health care I came out as
 
01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
Trans in the ninth grade to everyone in
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
my life I've legally changed my name in
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
July of 2020 this was the start of
 
01:16:12.770 --> 01:16:12.780 align:start position:0%
people knowing that I was trans but I
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
have been dealing with that knowledge
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
that I was different and not a girl
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
since fifth grade
 
01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
this was never a quickly made decision
 
01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
people never talk to me about about
 
01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:24.900 align:start position:0%
trans people I didn't know the terms I
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
had no one to make this decision for me
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
except me
 
01:16:30.649 --> 01:16:30.659 align:start position:0%
coming out was the best decision I've
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
made so far I'm happier and I made great
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
friends along the way this bill isn't
 
01:16:39.890 --> 01:16:39.900 align:start position:0%
going to save children this bill will
 
01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
harm children greatly
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
I've talked to some of my trans friends
 
01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
and it saddens me to see how scared we
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
all are because of this bill
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
taking away gender affirming Health Care
 
01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
is going to make trans kids feel like
 
01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
they have no purpose in this world
 
01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
because the adults that we are told are
 
01:16:58.729 --> 01:16:58.739 align:start position:0%
supposed to help us and the adults we
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
have been told to trust all of our Lives
 
01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
don't care about us because we are trans
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
how is this protecting children when
 
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
they feel that they are better off dead
 
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
than to stay in a state that has to
 
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
discuss whether or not they are
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
respected as a human being
 
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
I stand here today devastated that this
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
is a conversation that I need to have
 
01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
with you all
 
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration and
 
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
please vote to oppose this bill I'm
 
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
willing to answer any questions that you
 
01:17:29.209 --> 01:17:29.219 align:start position:0%
may have
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from committee
 
01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.290 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from committee

seeing none thank you
 
01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:38.570 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
please

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
next up is Melanie renfreo Hebert to be
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
hi good afternoon
 
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
committee for allowing this space for
 
01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
all of this testimony today I did have a
 
01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
rather generic testimony of my own not
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
based on personal experience but rather
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
based as my own personal experience as a
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
community Economic Development
 
01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.310 align:start position:0%
community Economic Development
specialist

01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
specialist
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 619 prohibits gender
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
transition transition for youth as well
 
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
as sex and gender education in our
 
01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
public schools and criminalizes
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
necessary Medical Care the bill is
 
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
clearly limiting the rights of a
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
specific population along with several
 
01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
similar bills with prohibitions on
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
bathrooms pronouns and sports it's
 
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
seeking to codify discrimination and so
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's a little triggering transphobia in
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire law
 
01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
um and I while I did have more to share
 
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
about our school system I'm going to
 
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
leave more time and space in this
 
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
process for individuals with personal
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
experiences that have so informed the
 
01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
committee throughout today and just to
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
say that I am proud to live in a
 
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
community where all voices can be heard
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
and in this room which I haven't been in
 
01:19:10.450 --> 01:19:10.460 align:start position:0%
since the fourth grade
 
01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
for the field trip we all had it you
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
um and then I'm glad to be here today
 
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
and to see so much attention effort and
 
01:19:23.570 --> 01:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
willingness to learn in this committee
 
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
and I am dismayed to find that our room
 
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
Goffstown representative who's a member
 
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
of your committee is not available today
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
to see the faces of these individuals as
 
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:36.300 align:start position:0%
they stand up here and tell personal and
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
in some cases heartbreaking stories that
 
01:19:41.229 --> 01:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
need to be heard to understand
 
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
the important of opposing House Bill 619
 
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
and please Market inexperiod to
 
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
legislate and not bring it up through
 
01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
this session
 
01:19:57.530 --> 01:19:57.540 align:start position:0%

and therapist I'm also a wife and mother
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
I am also a trans non-binary individual
 
01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate you listening to my
 
01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
I have lived in New Hampshire since 2018
 
01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
and have been honored to provide Mental
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
Health Services to youth adults and to
 
01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
families across inpatient and outpatient
 
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.390 align:start position:0%
families across inpatient and outpatient
environments

01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
environments
 
01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
this couple with my post-secondary
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
Education and Training have given me an
 
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
intimate look at how affirming care in a
 
01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
timely fashion can save lives
 
01:20:53.689 --> 01:20:53.699 align:start position:0%
how seeing oneself reflected in reading
 
01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
material or hearing the correct name and
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
pronouns used to address you without
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
fear of Retribution can be the deciding
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
factor in whether a person wants to live
 
01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
to see another day
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
I have personally worked with so many
 
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
young people who have found themselves
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
questioning their Identity or
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
orientation and while the outcome ranges
 
01:21:17.209 --> 01:21:17.219 align:start position:0%
that some people some young people
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
realize that they are indeed gay or
 
01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
trans or asexual or even straight
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
there are two main paths
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
to these realizations and on One path a
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
youth experience is validated by the
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
people closest to them
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
pronoun changes uh a haircut these are
 
01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
the Hallmarks of gender affirming care
 
01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
usually such care could evolve into
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
hormone therapy rarely is the surgery
 
01:21:49.010 --> 01:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
ever performed before the age of 18.
 
01:21:51.229 --> 01:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
often hormones a haircut or pronoun
 
01:21:53.209 --> 01:21:53.219 align:start position:0%
change is enough to see a young person
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
with a dire Outlook become a confident
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
self-assured human being
 
01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
my knowledge of how gender affirming
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
care and education impacts the lives of
 
01:22:04.729 --> 01:22:04.739 align:start position:0%
young people is also personal
 
01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
when my child came to me at the age of
 
01:22:08.209 --> 01:22:08.219 align:start position:0%
12 to inform me that they were
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
questioning their gender my fears were
 
01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
not about what book influenced them to
 
01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
feel this way
 
01:22:16.729 --> 01:22:16.739 align:start position:0%
I wasn't afraid that they would obtain
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
some surgery that they couldn't reverse
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
my concerns were around the difficulty
 
01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
of living a life where people would go
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
out of their way to negate my child's
 
01:22:26.159 --> 01:22:27.830 align:start position:0%
out of their way to negate my child's
existence

01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
existence
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
when my son approached me at the age of
 
01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
14 to let me know that he was not my
 
01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
daughter but was in fact my son
 
01:22:36.770 --> 01:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
I felt proud that our family had created
 
01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
an environment where he could feel safe
 
01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
to ponder these things and be his
 
01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:42.300 align:start position:0%
authentic self
 
01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:44.219 align:start position:0%
and I was thankful for every teacher
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
nurse therapist who treated my son with
 
01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
dignity instead of disdain
 
01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
HB 619 does not seek to protect Children
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
and Youth it instead seeks to force
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus young people back into the
 
01:22:59.810 --> 01:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
closet back into silence back into
 
01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:01.130 align:start position:0%
closet back into silence back into
Danger

01:23:01.130 --> 01:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
Danger
 
01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
this bill not only proposes bans on
 
01:23:04.970 --> 01:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
affirming care and education but a
 
01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
re-legalization of conversion therapy a
 
01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
Despicable practice that has traumatized
 
01:23:11.810 --> 01:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
youth across generations and across this
 
01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.310 align:start position:0%
youth across generations and across this
country

01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
I beg you if you care about children and
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
youth that care about all of them do not
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
pass hb619 thank you and I will take
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any thank you
 
01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
and I'll pause no pause please uh any
 
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak as Ann
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:45.649 --> 01:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Ian Blanchette I'm from
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
Lowell Massachusetts and I'm here to
 
01:23:51.370 --> 01:23:51.380 align:start position:0%
voice my support for Bill H
 
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
b619 my support for this bill stems from
 
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
my personal experience my grandson a New
 
01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:00.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident who happens to turn
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
14 today
 
01:24:02.159 --> 01:24:03.590 align:start position:0%
14 today
uh

01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:05.689 --> 01:24:05.699 align:start position:0%
has been transitioning since he was
 
01:24:07.729 --> 01:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
seven years old
 
01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
first socially then
 
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
as soon as was possible medically
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
the string this has put on our family is
 
01:24:16.679 --> 01:24:18.410 align:start position:0%
the string this has put on our family is
immeasurable

01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
immeasurable
 
01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
my daughter has succeeded in blocking
 
01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
contact of any kind with anyone in the
 
01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
family except a brother
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
alienating the child from his entire
 
01:24:32.810 --> 01:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
extended family that loves him cannot be
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
the best interest for him
 
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
I have not physically seen my grandson
 
01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
or have had any contact with him in
 
01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
the next time I see him I do not have
 
01:24:48.169 --> 01:24:48.179 align:start position:0%
any idea what to expect
 
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
his future of is one of a lifetime of
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
drugs and surgeries
 
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
all part of a large social experiment
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
that he's used in the most vulnerable
 
01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
among us our children
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
as test subjects
 
01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
please do not allow this to continue
 
01:25:08.930 --> 01:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
Lupron the most commonly used drugs to
 
01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
block puberty is an extremely powerful
 
01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
drug originally used to treat prostate
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
cancer and sex offenders
 
01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
the side effects are too numerous to
 
01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
mention but when ultimately combined
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
with cross-sex hormones primarily result
 
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
in stability
 
01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
by the time this bill has passed it will
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
likely be too late for my grandson
 
01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:33.350 align:start position:0%
likely be too late for my grandson
not

01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:25:35.689 --> 01:25:35.699 align:start position:0%
but not for the countless other children
 
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
in their families in New Hampshire thank
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
you for your time
 
01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you any questions
 
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
from committee members
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Susie Colt to
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
be followed by jamer Wilder
 
01:25:58.129 --> 01:25:58.139 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Susie Colt and I
 
01:26:00.290 --> 01:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
am from Whitefield thank you for the
 
01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:02.300 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify in this matter
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
the reason why I traveled all the way
 
01:26:07.330 --> 01:26:07.340 align:start position:0%
from the North country is because
 
01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
hb619 is Rife with so much dis
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
information and has the potential of
 
01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
violating so many constitutional rights
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
that it felt it was my duty to come down
 
01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
here and personally ask you to quickly
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
find it inexpedient to legislate my
 
01:26:26.209 --> 01:26:26.219 align:start position:0%
professional background includes 15
 
01:26:27.970 --> 01:26:27.980 align:start position:0%
years as an attorney
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
defending and promoting the civil rights
 
01:26:33.610 --> 01:26:33.620 align:start position:0%
of the lgbtq community in New Hampshire
 
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
in the 90s I testified in the same
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
Chambers to have sexual orientation
 
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
added to the law against discrimination
 
01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
which we succeeded in doing in 1997. I
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
helped repeal the discriminatory law
 
01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
that prohibited lesbians and gays from
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
being adoptive and foster parents
 
01:26:57.890 --> 01:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
and that happened in 1999 since that
 
01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
time silver unions became law marriage
 
01:27:03.890 --> 01:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
and finally gender identity was added to
 
01:27:07.729 --> 01:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
the law against discrimination in 2018.
 
01:27:10.129 --> 01:27:10.139 align:start position:0%
which should have been the final nail in
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
the coffin that gave notice to everyone
 
01:27:14.810 --> 01:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that discrimination and
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
hate against people because of their
 
01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation and gender identity
 
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
is illegal
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
sadly as evidenced by hb619 and other
 
01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
such attempts to discriminate against
 
01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
the lgbtq community we are still having
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
to fight for our basic civil rights and
 
01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
it is exhausting
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
I agree with section 2 Roman numeral 1
 
01:27:44.450 --> 01:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
of hb619 that New Hampshire has a
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
compelling governmental interest in
 
01:27:48.770 --> 01:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
protecting the health and safety of its
 
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
citizens especially children
 
01:27:55.090 --> 01:27:55.100 align:start position:0%
however this bill does not do that
 
01:27:58.129 --> 01:27:58.139 align:start position:0%
instead it will cause irreparable harm
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
to our children
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
to the parents fundamental rights to
 
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
autonomy by providing parents
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
prohibiting from parents from obtaining
 
01:28:09.229 --> 01:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
obtaining medical treatment for their
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
children it'll harm the medical and
 
01:28:14.090 --> 01:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
mental health profession by interfering
 
01:28:16.629 --> 01:28:16.639 align:start position:0%
in their Hippocratic oath to do no harm
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
and finally to the educational system by
 
01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
muslin and censoring teachers the only
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
thing this bill will do is put New
 
01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the National Limelight
 
01:28:29.629 --> 01:28:29.639 align:start position:0%
along with those States like Alabama
 
01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
Texas Tennessee and Arkansas who have
 
01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
passed similar bills all of which are
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
being challenged in the courts
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
you will be guaranteeing future
 
01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
litigation which will be a burden on the
 
01:28:43.970 --> 01:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and raise
 
01:28:46.970 --> 01:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
their budgets unnecessarily having to
 
01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
defend cases like this
 
01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
please just remember that you are hired
 
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
and elected to make laws not break laws
 
01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
you took an oath to uphold the
 
01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
Constitution of the United States and
 
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire please wrap up if nothing
 
01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
else please remember the long-held
 
01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
tradition of our state's motto Live Free
 
01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
or Die which guarantees New Hampshire
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
citizens freedom from overbearing
 
01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
governmental control over our lives
 
01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
a representative palazzov
 
01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:29:28.970 --> 01:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:29:30.890 --> 01:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
would you agree that there are some
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
activities that are appropriate for
 
01:29:37.689 --> 01:29:37.699 align:start position:0%
adults but not appropriate for miners
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
like you mentioned mileages would you
 
01:29:42.050 --> 01:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
agree that
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
for example metal just it's more adult
 
01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
activities and not for minus
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh adults can drive they can drink
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
miners cannot
 
01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:55.790 align:start position:0%
miners cannot
um

01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:58.129 --> 01:29:58.139 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand
 
01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
your question fully as it relates to
 
01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:03.719 align:start position:0%
this kind of Bill
 
01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
follow up think of uh
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
so I I mean uh
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
things that lgbts need affirmation but
 
01:30:21.370 --> 01:30:21.380 align:start position:0%
also the decision
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
for surgery for example or for being put
 
01:30:29.209 --> 01:30:29.219 align:start position:0%
on some treatment that will be a
 
01:30:29.219 --> 01:30:30.790 align:start position:0%
on some treatment that will be a
lifelong

01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
lifelong
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
is a serious decision similar to metal
 
01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
can you comment on that
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry sir I I don't understand I
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
don't understand your question I can't
 
01:30:53.810 --> 01:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
answer it sorry
 
01:30:56.930 --> 01:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
01:30:58.550 --> 01:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you oh I
 
01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
would you agree
 
01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
with me that there is a significant
 
01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
difference between the prohibition
 
01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:12.590 align:start position:0%
difference between the prohibition
against

01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.270 align:start position:0%
against
alcohol

01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
at a certain age which is based on our
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
current understanding of brain
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
development which changed over time
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
but that there is a fundamental
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
difference between that even though that
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
is an evidence-based decision that we've
 
01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
made as a society and the decision not
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
to follow evidence-based medical
 
01:31:41.450 --> 01:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
treatment for one segment of our
 
01:31:44.209 --> 01:31:44.219 align:start position:0%
population who would then be denied
 
01:31:47.770 --> 01:31:47.780 align:start position:0%
the same benefits of evidence-based
 
01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:49.490 align:start position:0%
the same benefits of evidence-based
understanding

01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and I do
 
01:31:54.169 --> 01:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
agree with you yes
 
01:31:56.330 --> 01:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:02.930 --> 01:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Jama Wilder
 
01:32:06.530 --> 01:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.450 --> 01:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
01:32:10.129 --> 01:32:10.139 align:start position:0%
um first I would like to just comment
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
and say that one of the things stated
 
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
earlier about the eunuch in the Bible
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence that says that that
 
01:32:19.970 --> 01:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
was something that he chose normally
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
during those times those castration
 
01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
happened by force so I just wanted to
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
note that
 
01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
I live in Hollis New Hampshire and I
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
have five children between the ages of 4
 
01:32:35.930 --> 01:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
and 18. and I am in support of this bill
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
it has been widely accepted that a
 
01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
child's brain does not develop until the
 
01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
age of 25. until then their mental
 
01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
faculties are underdeveloped their
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
inability to exercise careful judgment
 
01:32:53.330 --> 01:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
and weigh long-term consequences for
 
01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
their decisions is well documented
 
01:32:59.570 --> 01:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
to allow a child under the age of 18 to
 
01:33:02.570 --> 01:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
make life-alterating decisions based on
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria cannot be reversed is
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
not only wrong it is child abuse from
 
01:33:10.729 --> 01:33:10.739 align:start position:0%
the parents and the doctors
 
01:33:13.129 --> 01:33:13.139 align:start position:0%
I had the opportunities to sit with a
 
01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
man who had attempted to transition to a
 
01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:16.189 align:start position:0%
man who had attempted to transition to a
woman

01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
woman
 
01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:19.139 align:start position:0%
he lived like that for decades and when
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
he decided it was not what he wanted he
 
01:33:24.110 --> 01:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
was left with no options of changing
 
01:33:26.930 --> 01:33:26.940 align:start position:0%
back the fillers in his body could not
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
be removed without Distortion and the
 
01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
hormones he took left his skin in
 
01:33:34.970 --> 01:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
appearance permanently changed he
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
described a feeling of being maimed and
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
broken he shared with me that every man
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
that he knew that had received
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
castration surgery struggled with
 
01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:48.300 align:start position:0%
suicide Suicidal Thoughts daily
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
I requested that our school allow him to
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
share his story to give the children a
 
01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
chance to reconsider what they might be
 
01:33:58.490 --> 01:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
doing to themselves and the school
 
01:33:58.500 --> 01:33:59.870 align:start position:0%
doing to themselves and the school
refused

01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
refused
 
01:34:02.450 --> 01:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
I cried many tears that day coming to
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
the realization that this was going to
 
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
be true for many of the children in our
 
01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:08.090 align:start position:0%
be true for many of the children in our
country

01:34:08.090 --> 01:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:34:10.370 --> 01:34:10.380 align:start position:0%
when I was in school many girls
 
01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
struggled with body dysphoria instead of
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
teaching them how to starve themselves
 
01:34:18.770 --> 01:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
if they had anorexia or teach them how
 
01:34:20.930 --> 01:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
to make themselves binge for bulimia
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
they were given counseling to help them
 
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
overcome their illness
 
01:34:28.370 --> 01:34:28.380 align:start position:0%
I wonder if anyone in this room over the
 
01:34:31.010 --> 01:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
age of 30 knew someone they grew up with
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
that expressed a desire to surgically
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
change their gender
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
we at need to ask ourselves why this has
 
01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
become so prevalent in our culture I
 
01:34:44.090 --> 01:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
would suggest that they are teaching
 
01:34:46.490 --> 01:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
children to question it by teaching what
 
01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
gender is in schools as young as
 
01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:50.629 align:start position:0%
gender is in schools as young as
kindergarten

01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
kindergarten
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
in the high school they have things on
 
01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
display like the gender bread person
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
which explains gender to the students
 
01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
these are not conversations the guidance
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
counselors or anyone else should be
 
01:35:06.649 --> 01:35:06.659 align:start position:0%
having with Someone's Child
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
after summer break in 2021 my children
 
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
returned to the public school to
 
01:35:15.169 --> 01:35:15.179 align:start position:0%
discover we had at least half please
 
01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
stop wrapping up you have 15 seconds
 
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
we had half a dozen students change
 
01:35:21.649 --> 01:35:21.659 align:start position:0%
their gender in our district
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
many are taking hormone alterating jobs
 
01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
and at least two were planning surgeries
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
I would argue that changing gender does
 
01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
not exist because it does not matter
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
what you do to the outward appearance of
 
01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
a person a man is still a man and a
 
01:35:38.090 --> 01:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
woman is still a Woman based on their
 
01:35:40.189 --> 01:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
DNA thank you thank you God do not make
 
01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
mistakes when he created classifications
 
01:35:45.690 --> 01:35:45.700 align:start position:0%

Greenfield New Hampshire I'm the 29 year

old transgender woman and I strongly
 
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 619
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is a debt sentence for Trans
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
and genderqueer youth as it would ban
 
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
access to act information in healthcare
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
vital to their well-being rates of
 
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
depression and suicide among trans youth
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
dropped dramatically when given access
 
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
to gender affirming health care and when
 
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
they are supported by their families
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
schools and communities
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
when I was younger I had no
 
01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
understanding of what being transgender
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
was nor did I have the access to the
 
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
necessary information to learn what
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
being transgender was
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
from the time I started puberty I was
 
01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
severely depressed
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
I had intrusive thoughts of suicide
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
every day for years every single day
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
every single day I had suicidal
 
01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
ideations and I had no idea why
 
01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
I struggled with this existence for
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
close to 15 years attempting suicide on
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
more than one occasion it wasn't until
 
01:37:16.189 --> 01:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
as an adult I stumbled across any
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
information that would save my life I
 
01:37:21.050 --> 01:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
still struggled after I started posting
 
01:37:23.689 --> 01:37:23.699 align:start position:0%
my gender when the day I decided to
 
01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
start my transition and accept myself
 
01:37:28.129 --> 01:37:28.139 align:start position:0%
was the day that the Suicidal Thoughts
 
01:37:31.250 --> 01:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
stopped and they stopped entirely I've
 
01:37:34.129 --> 01:37:34.139 align:start position:0%
had a zoo dog style ideation for more
 
01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
than eight months and I don't expect
 
01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
them to come back because I finally know
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
who I am and I'm proud of that person
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
but I was lucky
 
01:37:44.689 --> 01:37:44.699 align:start position:0%
it was pure dumb luck that I did not
 
01:37:46.490 --> 01:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
succeed in killing myself before
 
01:37:49.490 --> 01:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
discovering who I was not everyone is so
 
01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
lucky no one should have to go through
 
01:37:53.689 --> 01:37:53.699 align:start position:0%
the experiences that I did but this bill
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
would ensure that every single trans

youth in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:37:56.699 --> 01:37:59.090 align:start position:0%

would
 
01:38:01.490 --> 01:38:01.500 align:start position:0%

in opposition of hb619 this bill's own

transition care for minors under 18

definition of conversion therapy this
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%

dark day in New Hampshire
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
as a legislator in New Hampshire you
 
01:39:43.810 --> 01:39:43.820 align:start position:0%
swore to faithfully and impartially
 
01:39:46.610 --> 01:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
discharge and perform all your duties
 
01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon you as a state
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative one would assume that
 
01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
this means that prior to proposing any
 
01:39:54.590 --> 01:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
law to a British citizen's right at
 
01:39:56.450 --> 01:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
least a modicum of research would be
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
conducted clearly this hasn't been done
 
01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:01.739 align:start position:0%
as over 1.3 million doctors recognize
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
the medical necessity of transition
 
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
related care for improving the physical
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
and mental health of transgender people
 
01:40:11.570 --> 01:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
as a parent of a transgender son it's
 
01:40:13.970 --> 01:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
bills like hb619 that encourage the
 
01:40:16.729 --> 01:40:16.739 align:start position:0%
daily systematic attacks on my son's
 
01:40:18.290 --> 01:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
very existence and they put him in
 
01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:19.370 align:start position:0%
very existence and they put him in
danger

01:40:19.370 --> 01:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
danger
 
01:40:21.709 --> 01:40:21.719 align:start position:0%
as a legislator voting in favor of these
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
bills you're culpable
 
01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't wish the amount of stress
 
01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
I've endured at the hands of bills like
 
01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
this and willfully uninformed and
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
hate-filled people on anybody
 
01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
despite multiple Doctorate Degrees being
 
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
a woman my biggest accomplishment is
 
01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
keeping my son alive to the age of 18. I
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
want you all to let that sink in
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
on his face hb619 has hate masquerading
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
as fear and it is control masquerading
 
01:40:51.530 --> 01:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
as protection it's born out of a willful
 
01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
ignorance of the facts and it's a
 
01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
blatant attempt to dehumanize a group of
 
01:40:57.530 --> 01:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
people that have been deemed different
 
01:41:00.410 --> 01:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
or less than by the Bill's sponsors not
 
01:41:02.209 --> 01:41:02.219 align:start position:0%
only does it encourage transphobic
 
01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
Behavior it requires it
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
trans men and women are citizens of our
 
01:41:10.010 --> 01:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
country and in our state just like you
 
01:41:11.090 --> 01:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:41:13.010 --> 01:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
we all deserve protection under the
 
01:41:15.410 --> 01:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
Constitution this continued to tackle my
 
01:41:17.090 --> 01:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
son and other transgender persons
 
01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
discuss me and makes me angry as a
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
mother and as a citizen
 
01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
I oppose hb619 as repugnant to their
 
01:41:26.450 --> 01:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
rights and Liberties contained in the
 
01:41:28.850 --> 01:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
Constitution and it must be deemed in
 
01:41:30.890 --> 01:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate thank you all for
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
your time has to answer any questions
 
01:41:35.209 --> 01:41:35.219 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee
 
01:41:35.219 --> 01:41:37.010 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee
members

01:41:37.010 --> 01:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:41:40.129 --> 01:41:40.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:42.169 --> 01:41:42.179 align:start position:0%
that's up to speak uh is Betsy
 
01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Betsy Harrington from Deering I
 
01:41:50.930 --> 01:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the opportunity to
 
01:41:54.590 --> 01:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
speak today I am in support of this bill
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
I believe that growing up means
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
something when I was a kid I used to say
 
01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
all the time when I grow up
 
01:42:06.530 --> 01:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
when I was a kid I really wanted to be a
 
01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
boy I played hockey I was the only girl
 
01:42:11.450 --> 01:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
playing hockey through high school the
 
01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
only girl in the team I tried out
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
through the Olympics when I was 26.
 
01:42:18.169 --> 01:42:18.179 align:start position:0%
and I felt really alone being the only
 
01:42:18.179 --> 01:42:19.070 align:start position:0%
and I felt really alone being the only
girl

01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
girl
 
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
but I was told by my father when I told
 
01:42:24.410 --> 01:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
him I wanted to be a boy around the age
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
of four when I was playing beginners
 
01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
hockey because everything I liked was
 
01:42:31.609 --> 01:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
boy I didn't like anything about girls
 
01:42:34.250 --> 01:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
at all I just wanted to be a boy
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
everything about being a boy was way
 
01:42:36.239 --> 01:42:37.790 align:start position:0%
everything about being a boy was way
cooler

01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
cooler
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
but he said when you grow up when you
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
grow up you get to decide what you want
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
to be right
 
01:42:46.970 --> 01:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
so I feel like we still need to do that
 
01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
when you grow up you get decide I love
 
01:42:54.050 --> 01:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
every one of you I'm a therapist I was a
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
sex offender therapist at the prison I
 
01:42:59.629 --> 01:42:59.639 align:start position:0%
have worked with transgender people
 
01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoric people I think it's
 
01:43:06.169 --> 01:43:06.179 align:start position:0%
okay to say we wait until you're 18. I
 
01:43:08.450 --> 01:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
think we can support those kids in other
 
01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
ways but
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think that having surgery or
 
01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
giving them medications that could
 
01:43:18.410 --> 01:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
ultimately castrate them people here
 
01:43:20.510 --> 01:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
lied to you and said that those things
 
01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
are pausing they are not pausing a lot
 
01:43:27.229 --> 01:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
of those drugs castrate our children
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
they can never have children so like me
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
if they change their mind and realize
 
01:43:35.209 --> 01:43:35.219 align:start position:0%
that they want to be a girl now they can
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
never have kids
 
01:43:39.709 --> 01:43:39.719 align:start position:0%
so when they grow up is something
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
important and I urge you to wait until
 
01:43:43.970 --> 01:43:43.980 align:start position:0%
they grow up
 
01:43:45.229 --> 01:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
you want questions or any questions with
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:43:53.689 --> 01:43:53.699 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
um so my question is
 
01:43:58.669 --> 01:43:58.679 align:start position:0%
um with regards to your capacity as a
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
therapist we heard a testimony earlier
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
on from the medical community and the
 
01:44:07.729 --> 01:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
ACLU that gender affirming therapy is
 
01:44:11.570 --> 01:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
the only evidence-based approach to
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
addressing uh the issue with gender
 
01:44:16.669 --> 01:44:16.679 align:start position:0%
dysphoria so Mental Health Care is not
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
an evidence-based approach to handle
 
01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
this well so that's my question so are
 
01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
you aware of other evidence-based
 
01:44:26.450 --> 01:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
approaches aside from we would do
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
medical mental health care until they
 
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
were 18 and I believe that that would be
 
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
very effective we can affirm them we
 
01:44:40.010 --> 01:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:44:45.229 --> 01:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing none thank you
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
next up to speak is Kurt donated to be

is he here
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
not seeing okay
 
01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
all right moving on uh next up to speak
 
01:45:20.450 --> 01:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
is Nina scrakuzi to be followed by Eva
 
01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:28.070 align:start position:0%
is Nina scrakuzi to be followed by Eva
Ford

01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
hi well
 
01:45:34.010 --> 01:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
my name is Dr Nina strakuzi I live in
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
Dover New Hampshire and I teach
 
01:45:37.609 --> 01:45:37.619 align:start position:0%
sociology at the University of New
 
01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here to express my
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
strong opposition to HB 619
 
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
I've been teaching for 25 years
 
01:45:49.750 --> 01:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
I teach sexual behavior
 
01:45:53.330 --> 01:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
sociology of the family gender medical
 
01:45:56.090 --> 01:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
sociology and I would be remiss if I
 
01:45:58.609 --> 01:45:58.619 align:start position:0%
were not to include the lgbtq plus
 
01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
community and talk about the challenges
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
they confront in my classes
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
I've had dozens of trans students over
 
01:46:07.370 --> 01:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
the years many with whom I've developed
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
close relationships and I've been
 
01:46:12.169 --> 01:46:12.179 align:start position:0%
following changing policies that impact
 
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
the lgbtq plus Community for a very long
 
01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:16.310 align:start position:0%
the lgbtq plus Community for a very long
time

01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
until recently I believe that as a
 
01:46:20.209 --> 01:46:20.219 align:start position:0%
society we were moving in the right
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
direction albeit slowly and at least on
 
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
a college campus I could see the
 
01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:25.729 align:start position:0%
a college campus I could see the
progress

01:46:25.729 --> 01:46:25.739 align:start position:0%
progress
 
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
whereas trans students used to be
 
01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
reticent about openly navigating the
 
01:46:32.570 --> 01:46:32.580 align:start position:0%
world as trans 15 or 20 years ago they
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
now seem more comfortable and for the
 
01:46:36.649 --> 01:46:36.659 align:start position:0%
most part they feel safer accepted and
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
cared about at least in my Camp my
 
01:46:41.149 --> 01:46:41.159 align:start position:0%
classroom and other Havens around campus
 
01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
how do I know that years of personal
 
01:46:46.189 --> 01:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
conversations with students observations
 
01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
and my experience as an ally
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
HP 619 would not only derail the
 
01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
progress I've seen in one Fell Swoop it
 
01:46:56.090 --> 01:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
would be denying basic human rights
 
01:46:59.149 --> 01:46:59.159 align:start position:0%
not misgendering my students is the bare
 
01:47:01.070 --> 01:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
minimum I can do to create a hospitable
 
01:47:02.570 --> 01:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
learning environment and treat them with
 
01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:03.470 align:start position:0%
learning environment and treat them with
respect

01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
respect
 
01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
HB 619 would require teachers to
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
misgender and dead name students or risk
 
01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
losing their jobs
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
forcing people to enact harm on the
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
students they're meant to support makes
 
01:47:15.050 --> 01:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
creating an equitable and safe learning
 
01:47:16.669 --> 01:47:16.679 align:start position:0%
environment impossible
 
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
the fact that HB 619 is even on the
 
01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
docket has already resulted in my
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
students feeling threatened as it sends
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
a clear anti-trans message they are
 
01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
especially concerned for friends they
 
01:47:32.209 --> 01:47:32.219 align:start position:0%
have still in high school
 
01:47:34.129 --> 01:47:34.139 align:start position:0%
things stand despite some positive
 
01:47:35.930 --> 01:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
change not everyone feels accepted in
 
01:47:37.970 --> 01:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
all aspects of their lives and that is
 
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
one reason why it is so important to
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
provide a supportive environment for
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
Trans students without feeling
 
01:47:44.450 --> 01:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
threatened every time they turn around
 
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
they can focus on their education which
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
is the reason they're at UNH it's very
 
01:47:51.410 --> 01:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
difficult to learn when your identity is
 
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
under siege
 
01:47:54.410 --> 01:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
you've already heard the data on
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
violence against trans people poor
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
mental health outcomes and increased
 
01:47:59.629 --> 01:47:59.639 align:start position:0%
risk for suicide
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
all young people in America are
 
01:48:04.609 --> 01:48:04.619 align:start position:0%
experiencing a mental health crisis and
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
trans youth are certainly faring far
 
01:48:09.290 --> 01:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
worse there are multiple reasons to
 
01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
imagine HB 619 will exacerbate these
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
issues and if those data aren't enough
 
01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
to sway anyone let's not forget the
 
01:48:19.310 --> 01:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
economic cost of a decline in the mental
 
01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:20.719 align:start position:0%
health and well-being of a population
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure HB 619 has a plan to
 
01:48:26.330 --> 01:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
account for the large economic costs to
 
01:48:27.649 --> 01:48:27.659 align:start position:0%
those Afflicted with mental health

any of their faces should these bills
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
come to pass I can't even believe I live

in a state that would even consider such
 
01:48:55.490 --> 01:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
blatant discrimination against a group
 
01:48:57.850 --> 01:48:57.860 align:start position:0%

01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
619
 
01:49:31.850 --> 01:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
I believe in public education that
 
01:49:33.770 --> 01:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
provides a sanctuary for all students
 
01:49:35.810 --> 01:49:35.820 align:start position:0%
regardless of their gender identity the
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
color of their skin or the money in
 
01:49:38.530 --> 01:49:38.540 align:start position:0%
their pockets
 
01:49:40.970 --> 01:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
hb619 does nothing to address the real
 
01:49:43.010 --> 01:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
problems facing kids and teenagers today
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
like bullying housing insecurity gun
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
violence and a mental health crisis
 
01:49:48.770 --> 01:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
that's been skyrocketing to the point
 
01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
where our local high schoolers had to
 
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
propose their own bill this session in
 
01:49:55.490 --> 01:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
an effort to get their needs addressed
 
01:49:57.649 --> 01:49:57.659 align:start position:0%
this bill actively causes harm and
 
01:49:59.390 --> 01:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
violence to any student who does not
 
01:50:01.729 --> 01:50:01.739 align:start position:0%
align with the rigid gender binary and
 
01:50:03.890 --> 01:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
anyone who supports them it 'd be the
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
goal of teachers and administrators to
 
01:50:07.250 --> 01:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
Foster an environment in which all
 
01:50:08.689 --> 01:50:08.699 align:start position:0%
children can participate in their
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
learning but hb619 would make that
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
impossible by forcing teachers to
 
01:50:14.330 --> 01:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
misgender and dead name their students
 
01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
every day if teachers choose to ignore
 
01:50:18.050 --> 01:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
this bill and continue to respect their
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
students gender identities they risk
 
01:50:22.250 --> 01:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
being fired this bill is rooted in
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
Conservative Christian beliefs that
 
01:50:25.729 --> 01:50:25.739 align:start position:0%
seeks divorce students and staff to
 
01:50:27.649 --> 01:50:27.659 align:start position:0%
operate within the gender binary and
 
01:50:29.689 --> 01:50:29.699 align:start position:0%
adds extreme consequences for anyone who
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
speaks of an alternative
 
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
school is supposed to be a place where
 
01:50:34.669 --> 01:50:34.679 align:start position:0%
we learn to interact with people who are
 
01:50:36.530 --> 01:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
different from us not create more
 
01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
division among cisgender people and
 
01:50:40.490 --> 01:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
anyone outside the gender binary
 
01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
that bill is a pipeline to increase
 
01:50:44.450 --> 01:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
rates of bullying and violence for Trans
 
01:50:47.570 --> 01:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
kids while I don't agree with HB 619 and
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
some of you may not agree with me we
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
don't need to agree today because we
 
01:50:53.330 --> 01:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
have a separation of church and state
 
01:50:55.250 --> 01:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
the purpose of public education is not
 
01:50:57.290 --> 01:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
to exercise one opinion onto everyone
 
01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
else the purpose is to provide children
 
01:51:01.550 --> 01:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
with many perspectives and give them the
 
01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
tools to navigate this complicated World
 
01:51:05.570 --> 01:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
once they become adults that's why we
 
01:51:06.890 --> 01:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
have teachers and administrators with
 
01:51:08.450 --> 01:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
Advanced degrees to invest in the
 
01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
education of our children if parents are
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
upset with the curriculum they might
 
01:51:14.209 --> 01:51:14.219 align:start position:0%
want to consider homeschooling some of
 
01:51:16.490 --> 01:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
the arguments in favor of HB 619 are
 
01:51:18.109 --> 01:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
resting on some of the same logic used
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
in 1954 when white parents fought to
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
keep schools segregated in fear of their
 
01:51:24.109 --> 01:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
white children interacting with black
 
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
children requiring trans students to
 
01:51:28.370 --> 01:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
conform to the gender binary that
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
actively harms them won't stop trans
 
01:51:32.570 --> 01:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
kids from being trans and I can't
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
imagine any ulterior motive other than
 
01:51:37.250 --> 01:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
trying to make cisgender students more
 
01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:38.390 align:start position:0%
trying to make cisgender students more
comfortable

01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
01:51:40.370 --> 01:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
is this the direction we want to go in
 
01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
we all know the quote those who fail to
 
01:51:44.570 --> 01:51:44.580 align:start position:0%
learn from history are bound to repeat
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
it creating learning environments that
 
01:51:48.410 --> 01:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
exclude trans children won't just harm
 
01:51:50.090 --> 01:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
the trans children it will also harm
 
01:51:51.590 --> 01:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
their families their peers and their
 
01:51:54.290 --> 01:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
Educators why is it so wrong for our
 
01:51:55.729 --> 01:51:55.739 align:start position:0%
students to learn to be empathetic and
 
01:51:57.590 --> 01:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
treat everyone with dignity and respect
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
our society is becoming increasingly
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
diverse and we should be learning to
 
01:52:02.209 --> 01:52:02.219 align:start position:0%
work with those who are different from
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
us not draw deeper lines in the sand
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
telling those who are different they
 
01:52:07.609 --> 01:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
need to stop being themselves so that
 
01:52:09.649 --> 01:52:09.659 align:start position:0%
other people can be more comfortable
 
01:52:11.450 --> 01:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
I'm here because I do not believe this
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
bill serves any purpose aligned with
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
quality education or protecting children
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
requiring some students to hide who they
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
are for the comfort of others protects
 
01:52:21.410 --> 01:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
no one it just creates more pain I love
 
01:52:22.970 --> 01:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
the trans people in my life and I'm
 
01:52:24.830 --> 01:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
grateful they didn't have to endure an
 
01:52:26.810 --> 01:52:26.820 align:start position:0%
educational experience as discriminatory
 
01:52:30.590 --> 01:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
and dehumanizing as hb619 anyone who
 
01:52:32.450 --> 01:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
believes in protecting children and and
 
01:52:33.890 --> 01:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
please stop wrapping up you have 15
 
01:52:36.290 --> 01:52:36.300 align:start position:0%

not repeating it but the state of New
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not allow children to get
 
01:53:56.510 --> 01:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
tattoos because children cannot consent
 
01:53:59.930 --> 01:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
to permanently altering their body we do

oppose H.E 6119
 
01:54:59.330 --> 01:54:59.340 align:start position:0%
I grew up knowing that I was different
 
01:55:01.609 --> 01:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
from the girls around me I never wanted
 
01:55:04.189 --> 01:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
to wear dresses or skirts didn't enjoy
 
01:55:06.410 --> 01:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
playing dress-up or with dolls and it
 
01:55:08.450 --> 01:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
wasn't exciting for me when puberty hit
 
01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
but rather a large Catalyst for my
 
01:55:12.890 --> 01:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
struggles with mental health
 
01:55:15.410 --> 01:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
I started to realize what exactly being
 
01:55:17.450 --> 01:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
different could mean in high school
 
01:55:19.370 --> 01:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
during an assembly where I was first
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
exposed to the lgbtq community in the
 
01:55:24.649 --> 01:55:24.659 align:start position:0%
following years I continued to learn
 
01:55:26.330 --> 01:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
about different sexual and gender
 
01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
experiences through my own research and
 
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
students and teachers who spoke on their
 
01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:32.810 align:start position:0%
students and teachers who spoke on their
experiences

01:55:32.810 --> 01:55:32.820 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
part of this bill aims to prohibit
 
01:55:37.129 --> 01:55:37.139 align:start position:0%
gender transition procedures to minors
 
01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
that would be catastrophic to the trans
 
01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
youth of our state
 
01:55:43.250 --> 01:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
for me it was around the time that
 
01:55:44.810 --> 01:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
puberty hit that my mental health
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
started rapidly declining gender
 
01:55:50.450 --> 01:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
dysphoria is brutal my body didn't fit
 
01:55:52.250 --> 01:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
like I had to put on a shirt that was
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
too tight and could never take it off
 
01:55:56.930 --> 01:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
I was suicidal for a large part of my
 
01:55:58.910 --> 01:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
teen years because death seemed a better
 
01:56:01.129 --> 01:56:01.139 align:start position:0%
option than living in an identity that
 
01:56:02.750 --> 01:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't mine
 
01:56:04.850 --> 01:56:04.860 align:start position:0%
what was the point in living when I went
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
through everyday hating myself
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
I grew up in a period of time where
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
trans identities weren't well known and
 
01:56:12.890 --> 01:56:12.900 align:start position:0%
there was no media attention on the
 
01:56:15.229 --> 01:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
topic there is a lot of hate and
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
violence directed towards the trends
 
01:56:19.070 --> 01:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
used now through the media and I can't
 
01:56:21.169 --> 01:56:21.179 align:start position:0%
imagine trying to keep fighting while my
 
01:56:24.410 --> 01:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
community was being openly attacked
 
01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
I'm an adult now I've realized my
 
01:56:28.729 --> 01:56:28.739 align:start position:0%
identity and started my own process of
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
gender transition when the hormones
 
01:56:33.530 --> 01:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
started taking effect on my body and I
 
01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
finally learned what it was like to love
 
01:56:37.550 --> 01:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
myself looking in the mirror it was
 
01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:39.050 align:start position:0%
myself looking in the mirror it was
life-changing

01:56:39.050 --> 01:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
life-changing
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
but I missed out on a large part of my
 
01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
teenage years and it was preventable I
 
01:56:45.649 --> 01:56:45.659 align:start position:0%
think it's appropriate that the world
 
01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
professional association for transgender
 
01:56:50.270 --> 01:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
Health recommends it after a
 
01:56:52.609 --> 01:56:52.619 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary assessment youth be
 
01:56:53.930 --> 01:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
allowed to start hormone replacement
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
therapy as young as 14 so they
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
experience puberty with their peers if
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
I've had the opportunity to go on
 
01:57:03.169 --> 01:57:03.179 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers if I'd been taught
 
01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
about the lgbtq community in school if
 
01:57:08.450 --> 01:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
I'd been able to start hormone therapy
 
01:57:10.729 --> 01:57:10.739 align:start position:0%
as a young teen my life would look very
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
different right now
 
01:57:14.450 --> 01:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
trying to see if they're being attacked
 
01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
across the country right now and it
 
01:57:18.410 --> 01:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
sends a very clear message that they are
 
01:57:20.570 --> 01:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
not important that their lives and
 
01:57:22.729 --> 01:57:22.739 align:start position:0%
identities don't matter
 
01:57:24.890 --> 01:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
this bill would have extremely harmful
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
impacts for Trans youth so I urge a
 
01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
committee to vote
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
itl on hb6 and 18. thank you for your
 
01:57:34.850 --> 01:57:34.860 align:start position:0%
time I will not be accepting questions
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:41.089 --> 01:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak is Paul sanchak to be
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:47.570 --> 01:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:57:49.490 --> 01:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
um it'll be a feeling of privilege to be
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:57:52.970 --> 01:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
to talk today and give a perspective I
 
01:57:52.980 --> 01:57:54.350 align:start position:0%
to talk today and give a perspective I
hope

01:57:54.350 --> 01:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
hope
 
01:57:56.990 --> 01:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
um I do want to thank representative Roy
 
01:57:59.209 --> 01:57:59.219 align:start position:0%
when he started off and introduced the
 
01:58:01.850 --> 01:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
bill that he said that his main purpose
 
01:58:05.149 --> 01:58:05.159 align:start position:0%
was to um to look you know and try to
 
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
increase conversation around this
 
01:58:10.729 --> 01:58:10.739 align:start position:0%
particular topic which we really all are
 
01:58:12.910 --> 01:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
struggling with
 
01:58:16.910 --> 01:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
I personally have been a a teacher in
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:24.430 --> 01:58:24.440 align:start position:0%
I've been a teacher for 30 years
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
I have participated in I was a pastor
 
01:58:30.910 --> 01:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
for 11 years
 
01:58:33.410 --> 01:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
I'm now working in a Recovery Center
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
than in Milford New Hampshire I I kind
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
of referenced Milford because most
 
01:58:40.189 --> 01:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
likely you have seen Milford in the news
 
01:58:44.270 --> 01:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
these days and I would
 
01:58:46.669 --> 01:58:46.679 align:start position:0%
one of my main points the reason I came
 
01:58:50.209 --> 01:58:50.219 align:start position:0%
here was here is that I saw the bill as
 
01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
something that was um would possibly
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
help us understand the jurisdictions
 
01:58:59.450 --> 01:58:59.460 align:start position:0%
between you know who has responsibility
 
01:59:01.729 --> 01:59:01.739 align:start position:0%
for children and I'm real concerned
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
about 18 and under like everybody else's
 
01:59:06.050 --> 01:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
and I would really would like to affirm
 
01:59:09.410 --> 01:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
the LGBT community is that as a recovery
 
01:59:12.109 --> 01:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
coach which I am right now and working
 
01:59:14.030 --> 01:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
in the in the trenches with everybody
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
else that compassion is the number one
 
01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
love and number one is the compassion
 
01:59:21.589 --> 01:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
for all of you that are involved in that
 
01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
particular situation and for someone who
 
01:59:27.229 --> 01:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
is somewhat out of the loop or was under
 
01:59:29.390 --> 01:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
the out of the loop I've learned a lot
 
01:59:31.490 --> 01:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
from listening even here today
 
01:59:37.129 --> 01:59:37.139 align:start position:0%
so my real concern here is that and if I
 
01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
was going to as a medical health worker
 
01:59:42.250 --> 01:59:42.260 align:start position:0%
as well as a recovery coach
 
01:59:44.570 --> 01:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
you know with addiction and those types
 
01:59:46.729 --> 01:59:46.739 align:start position:0%
of things what I've heard from them is
 
01:59:48.770 --> 01:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
that as a mental health worker 80
 
01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
percent of the problems would be solved
 
01:59:53.689 --> 01:59:53.699 align:start position:0%
in our schools and and with the youth
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
and especially those that are habitated
 
01:59:57.890 --> 01:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
dysphoria is if they had a safe place
 
02:00:01.729 --> 02:00:01.739 align:start position:0%
and a safe person affirming laws can't
 
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
really do this okay and if we did pass
 
02:00:06.410 --> 02:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
these laws they wouldn't really have a
 
02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
lot of effect but they do resist evil
 
02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
and they do provoke the things that are
 
02:00:16.250 --> 02:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
good so my suggestion today is that um
 
02:00:18.970 --> 02:00:18.980 align:start position:0%
is that came from the beginning is this
 
02:00:23.229 --> 02:00:23.239 align:start position:0%
if we could have emotionally healthy
 
02:00:26.030 --> 02:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
conversations with one another and even
 
02:00:29.149 --> 02:00:29.159 align:start position:0%
here today I can if I say I support this
 
02:00:31.129 --> 02:00:31.139 align:start position:0%
bill I'm not sure if I can go back to my
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
seat or someone just say is hate speak
 
02:00:36.830 --> 02:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
that I would actually support it in
 
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
reality I I think it's inexperedient to
 
02:00:42.649 --> 02:00:42.659 align:start position:0%
to legislate but it is bringing up a lot
 
02:00:44.649 --> 02:00:44.659 align:start position:0%
of questions
 
02:00:46.970 --> 02:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
and that is that we have to have those
 
02:00:49.970 --> 02:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
open conversations with one another and
 
02:00:51.649 --> 02:00:51.659 align:start position:0%
both sides need to come together and I
 
02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
would love to be part of that situation
 
02:00:55.850 --> 02:00:55.860 align:start position:0%
if anybody would like to have that
 
02:00:57.890 --> 02:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
conversation thank you very much thank
 
02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:00.169 align:start position:0%
conversation thank you very much thank

before I go to the next speaker uh it is

02:01:55.790 --> 02:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
three years now and I wanted to come up
 
02:01:57.669 --> 02:01:57.679 align:start position:0%
by my legal name
 
02:02:00.770 --> 02:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
to show you that there are already so
 
02:02:04.729 --> 02:02:04.739 align:start position:0%
many hurdles in the way of transitioning
 
02:02:07.370 --> 02:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
you have to change your documents or
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
your legal name
 
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
in order to change physically you have
 
02:02:15.290 --> 02:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
to get notices from doctors and
 
02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
therapists and it's a long and arduous
 
02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:20.450 align:start position:0%
therapists and it's a long and arduous
Journey

02:02:20.450 --> 02:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
Journey
 
02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
I have worked with the Trans youth from
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
this state and from all over this
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
country for a couple years now
 
02:02:32.750 --> 02:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
and they are very well educated on how
 
02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
they feel on who they are and what
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
hormone replacement therapy means for
 
02:02:43.609 --> 02:02:43.619 align:start position:0%
them currently and in the long run and
 
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
as are their parents this is a decision
 
02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
that is made by the family unit by the
 
02:02:53.570 --> 02:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
doctors by the therapists this is not a
 
02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
decision to be made legally
 
02:02:59.930 --> 02:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
in the courts in this room
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
this is for individuals to decide
 
02:03:05.689 --> 02:03:05.699 align:start position:0%
I hope you keep that in mind and I hope
 
02:03:12.649 --> 02:03:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Kathy
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%

Brennan
 
02:03:21.649 --> 02:03:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:24.709 --> 02:03:24.719 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Kathy
 
02:03:29.570 --> 02:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639 align:start position:0%
first of all I'd like to thank you so
 
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
much for all of you do
 
02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate all the hard work
 
02:03:39.050 --> 02:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
you do for the citizens of New Hampshire
 
02:03:41.149 --> 02:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
02:03:41.159 --> 02:03:42.350 align:start position:0%
so thank you
second

02:03:42.350 --> 02:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:03:44.689 --> 02:03:44.699 align:start position:0%
I would like to share three sections
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
from the Bible
 
02:03:48.589 --> 02:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
to you there is much I could share
 
02:03:51.709 --> 02:03:51.719 align:start position:0%
personally on my thoughts and opinions
 
02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
in regards as HB 619 however the most
 
02:03:58.850 --> 02:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
important words that we can all learn
 
02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
and glean and learn from God's word is
 
02:04:03.770 --> 02:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
the Bible
 
02:04:06.589 --> 02:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
you're all sworn into office with your
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
hands placed on the Bible your hand was
 
02:04:12.290 --> 02:04:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
on the outside however what's inside is
 
02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
the most important
 
02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's what's inside that matters
 
02:04:26.450 --> 02:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
I believe in the word of God this is his
 
02:04:28.609 --> 02:04:28.619 align:start position:0%
word and I believe it
 
02:04:30.649 --> 02:04:30.659 align:start position:0%
here are the three sections from the
 
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
Bible that I'm going to read the first
 
02:04:38.750 --> 02:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
one is from Genesis 1 26 to 28 and verse
 
02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:40.189 align:start position:0%
one is from Genesis 1 26 to 28 and verse
31.

02:04:40.189 --> 02:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
31.
 
02:04:45.290 --> 02:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:49.129 --> 02:04:49.139 align:start position:0%
then God said let us make Mankind in our
 
02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
image in our likeness so that they may
 
02:04:54.410 --> 02:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
rule over the fish and the Sea and the
 
02:04:57.050 --> 02:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
birds in the sky over all the livestock
 
02:04:59.629 --> 02:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
and all the wild animals and over all
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
the creatures that move along the ground
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
so God created Mankind in his own image
 
02:05:09.470 --> 02:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
in the image of God he created them male
 
02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
and female he created them
 
02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
finally in verse 31 God said all he had
 
02:05:18.530 --> 02:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
God saw all he had made
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
and it was very good
 
02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
and there was evening and there was
 
02:05:34.070 --> 02:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
these are the words and I pray you
 
02:05:38.450 --> 02:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
receive them
 
02:05:41.689 --> 02:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
second verses from Psalms
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:55.310 --> 02:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
Psalms 139 13-14 for you created my
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
inmost being you met me together in my
 
02:06:00.410 --> 02:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
mother's womb I praise you because I'm
 
02:06:02.570 --> 02:06:02.580 align:start position:0%

I pray you hear these words and receive
 
02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:10.790 align:start position:0%
I pray you hear these words and receive
them

02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:06:14.589 --> 02:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
finally this is from Philippians 4 6
 
02:06:20.810 --> 02:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:24.050 --> 02:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
finally brothers and sisters whatever is
 
02:06:27.530 --> 02:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
true whatever is Noble whatever is right
 
02:06:30.589 --> 02:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
whatever is pure whatever is lovely
 
02:06:32.750 --> 02:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
whatever is admirable if anything is
 
02:06:34.490 --> 02:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
excellent worth it think about those
 
02:06:37.490 --> 02:06:37.500 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
02:07:07.609 --> 02:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
Brennan I'm from where she her
 
02:07:12.890 --> 02:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
I oppose 619 for two reasons one it is
 
02:07:15.530 --> 02:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
based on inaccurate and misleading
 
02:07:18.229 --> 02:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
information and two it does major harm
 
02:07:20.450 --> 02:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
to our transgender and non-binary
 
02:07:24.890 --> 02:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
population I have done some research too
 
02:07:27.050 --> 02:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
much to share with you in three minutes
 
02:07:30.669 --> 02:07:30.679 align:start position:0%
so I will be sending it to you via email
 
02:07:33.770 --> 02:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
here's one example of something I found
 
02:07:37.310 --> 02:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
the bill States studies consistently
 
02:07:40.370 --> 02:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the majority of kids come to
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
identify with their biological sex in
 
02:07:47.930 --> 02:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
adolescence and adulthood this is a lie
 
02:07:52.189 --> 02:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
it is based on inaccurate outdated
 
02:07:56.350 --> 02:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
studies and faulty methodology
 
02:08:00.530 --> 02:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
recent accurate studies such as one in
 
02:08:05.330 --> 02:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
the journal Pediatrics found 94 of
 
02:08:08.450 --> 02:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
transgender youth maintain their gender
 
02:08:08.460 --> 02:08:09.709 align:start position:0%
transgender youth maintain their gender
identity

identity
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
this bill on page three calls for the
 
02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
prohibition of gender transition care
 
02:08:19.970 --> 02:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
for children and young adults they're
 
02:08:22.189 --> 02:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
mainly talking about puberty blockers
 
02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
and cross-sex hormones the bill States
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
risks outweigh benefits this is not true
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes there are some risks as there are in
 
02:08:38.209 --> 02:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
every medication we take you know what
 
02:08:40.030 --> 02:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
has risks
 
02:08:43.850 --> 02:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
ibuprofen in severe cases it can cause
 
02:08:46.129 --> 02:08:46.139 align:start position:0%
heart attack stroke kidney and liver
 
02:08:50.089 --> 02:08:50.099 align:start position:0%
failure and ulcers ibuprofen as for
 
02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
hormone and puberty blockers doctors who
 
02:08:55.070 --> 02:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
actually work with trans youth
 
02:08:57.589 --> 02:08:57.599 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the risks and are working to
 
02:09:01.010 --> 02:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
mitigate them they feel the benefits far
 
02:09:05.330 --> 02:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
outweigh the harm our transgender and
 
02:09:08.030 --> 02:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
non-binary youth are real and their
 
02:09:11.209 --> 02:09:11.219 align:start position:0%
right to exist should not be dismissed a
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
hateful speaker at CPAC this weekend
 
02:09:18.649 --> 02:09:18.659 align:start position:0%
said transness needs to be eradicated no
 
02:09:22.490 --> 02:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
it needs to be understood the bill says
 
02:09:25.070 --> 02:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
there is no credible scientific evidence
 
02:09:27.950 --> 02:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
that a person is anything other than the
 
02:09:30.589 --> 02:09:30.599 align:start position:0%
gender and biological sex they are born
 
02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
with I have included in what I will be
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
sending you a piece from Scientific
 
02:09:39.050 --> 02:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
American that totally refutes that
 
02:09:42.350 --> 02:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
please please do not pass this bill that
 
02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
renders these kids invisible that forces
 
02:09:48.649 --> 02:09:48.659 align:start position:0%
teachers to dead name them and deny
 
02:09:52.010 --> 02:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
their very existence I have transgender

children may have about their gender is
 
02:10:07.070 --> 02:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
only exacerbated by confusion about why
 
02:10:10.129 --> 02:10:10.139 align:start position:0%
they are being treated in such a hateful
 
02:10:13.490 --> 02:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
manner why they have to show up day

02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
please no applause
 
02:10:46.609 --> 02:10:46.619 align:start position:0%
next signed up to speak is a hell of
 
02:10:48.169 --> 02:10:48.179 align:start position:0%
Mullins to be followed by representative
 
02:10:50.270 --> 02:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
Jerry Cannon
 
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
all right cool thank you guys for having
 
02:10:56.689 --> 02:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
me I'm Heather Mullins and um I'm
 
02:10:59.209 --> 02:10:59.219 align:start position:0%
speaking in support of banding gender
 
02:11:01.970 --> 02:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
affirming care for minors
 
02:11:04.010 --> 02:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
um not that I don't agree that there are
 
02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
people that genuinely suffer from gender
 
02:11:09.410 --> 02:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
dysphoria or chromosomal abnormalities
 
02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
that actually cause them to be born with
 
02:11:14.330 --> 02:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
multiple reproductive organs and the
 
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
parents have to make a decision at Birth
 
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
um there's a social contagion going on
 
02:11:23.089 --> 02:11:23.099 align:start position:0%
right now where an assumption that every
 
02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
child every minor that thinks they have
 
02:11:30.169 --> 02:11:30.179 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria actually does and
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
there's two organizations I implore you
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
to look into one of them is called gays
 
02:11:38.330 --> 02:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
against rumors and it's actually members
 
02:11:42.169 --> 02:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
of the lgbtq community that strongly
 
02:11:45.050 --> 02:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
speak out against pushing these these
 
02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of drastic measures on minors
 
02:11:49.609 --> 02:11:49.619 align:start position:0%
because there are portions of the
 
02:11:52.490 --> 02:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
population that do outgrow them another
 
02:11:55.550 --> 02:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
organization called the changed movement
 
02:12:00.070 --> 02:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
our former lgbtq members that now live
 
02:12:03.530 --> 02:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
heterosexual lives and outgrew that
 
02:12:05.810 --> 02:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
um so for the young children that are
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
actually struggling legitimately with
 
02:12:10.669 --> 02:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
these issues all we are asking is that
 
02:12:13.129 --> 02:12:13.139 align:start position:0%
you give it a few years and allow them
 
02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
to see if they're one that outgrow it or
 
02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
if they're actually somebody who is just
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
struggling with finding an identity
 
02:12:23.209 --> 02:12:23.219 align:start position:0%
during some of the most controversial
 
02:12:26.570 --> 02:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
hormonal periods of a child's life I can
 
02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
personally say going through high school
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
I went through my own series of phases
 
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
and now here I am today so I have
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
tattoos that I got when I was 17 that
 
02:12:39.770 --> 02:12:39.780 align:start position:0%
when people ask me about them I say it's
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
a bad decision for my youth I'm thankful
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
that that wasn't a decision that
 
02:12:47.149 --> 02:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
permanently prevented me from having
 
02:12:50.030 --> 02:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
children as I have a 13 year old
 
02:12:53.390 --> 02:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
daughter who I care about dearly at the
 
02:12:55.790 --> 02:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
end of the day anybody suffering from
 
02:12:58.189 --> 02:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
any sort of anxiety depression or gender
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
dysphoria we want to affirm those kids
 
02:13:03.470 --> 02:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
but we want to affirm them that they are
 
02:13:06.530 --> 02:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
perfect just the way they are and that
 
02:13:09.229 --> 02:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
if they decide later in life to make
 
02:13:12.169 --> 02:13:12.179 align:start position:0%
changes we will support them but to go
 
02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
into a child's mind and tell them that
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
they need to make these drastic
 
02:13:20.569 --> 02:13:20.579 align:start position:0%
decisions in order to be whole to me is
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
criminal in this child abuse we need to
 
02:13:25.550 --> 02:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
love our children and we need to affirm
 
02:13:27.410 --> 02:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
them that they're perfect just the way
 
02:13:31.069 --> 02:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
they are and not childhood not do this
 
02:13:32.530 --> 02:13:32.540 align:start position:0%
stuff that's going to give them
 
02:13:36.109 --> 02:13:36.119 align:start position:0%
irreparable damage later in life and
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
there are members of the lgbtq community
 
02:13:41.450 --> 02:13:41.460 align:start position:0%
that have done this and regret the
 
02:13:44.270 --> 02:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
decision but they're not given a seat at
 
02:13:46.550 --> 02:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
the table like we heard another woman
 
02:13:49.069 --> 02:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
say she tried to have someone that
 
02:13:51.229 --> 02:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
regretted that decision going to a
 
02:13:53.390 --> 02:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
school to speak and I think it's really
 
02:13:56.089 --> 02:13:56.099 align:start position:0%
important that everybody gets a seat at
 
02:13:58.129 --> 02:13:58.139 align:start position:0%
the table and we don't write off the
 
02:14:00.050 --> 02:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
people that are actually suffering
 
02:14:03.290 --> 02:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
you're a suicidal ideation because they
 
02:14:06.290 --> 02:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
chose to do it thank you thank you
 
02:14:08.450 --> 02:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
I would point out that we have a great
 
02:14:11.089 --> 02:14:11.099 align:start position:0%
sound system here in the house chamber
 
02:14:13.250 --> 02:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
these microphones are really sensitive
 
02:14:15.530 --> 02:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
and I if you're not used to used to them
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
I can understand why you may think you
 
02:14:19.370 --> 02:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
need to be closer or speak louder than
 
02:14:22.430 --> 02:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
you do but um but please keep that in
 
02:14:24.430 --> 02:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
mind but thank you
 
02:14:26.930 --> 02:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
next step to speak is a representative
 
02:14:29.149 --> 02:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
Jerry cannon from our committee and to
 
02:14:33.530 --> 02:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and my fellow members
 
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
02:14:41.689 --> 02:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
we live in the land of the free and the
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
home of the brave
 
02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
some of the bravest people I know are
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
transgender people
 
02:14:51.770 --> 02:14:51.780 align:start position:0%
they face a lot as you've heard today
 
02:14:54.530 --> 02:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of challenges we face
 
02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
so what parent
 
02:14:58.250 --> 02:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to take care of their
 
02:15:00.770 --> 02:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
children what parent wouldn't do
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
everything possible to help their child
 
02:15:06.169 --> 02:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
when they've been diagnosed with a
 
02:15:09.649 --> 02:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:09.659 --> 02:15:12.050 align:start position:0%
 
School

02:15:12.050 --> 02:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
School
 
02:15:14.450 --> 02:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
is where children learn many subjects as
 
02:15:16.370 --> 02:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
well as how to socially interact with
 
02:15:16.380 --> 02:15:17.930 align:start position:0%
well as how to socially interact with
others

02:15:17.930 --> 02:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
others
 
02:15:21.109 --> 02:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
or transgender child this is a critical
 
02:15:23.930 --> 02:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
step in their transition and for many
 
02:15:26.330 --> 02:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
it's a continuation of the social
 
02:15:28.430 --> 02:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
experience they may have started in
 
02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:30.290 align:start position:0%
experience they may have started in
kindergarten

02:15:30.290 --> 02:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
kindergarten
 
02:15:32.930 --> 02:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
parents of transgender children want to
 
02:15:35.689 --> 02:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
see their child grow and become a
 
02:15:38.569 --> 02:15:38.579 align:start position:0%
successful member of society
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
attending school
 
02:15:44.510 --> 02:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
as the gender they identify is a
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
critical part of their growth
 
02:15:50.089 --> 02:15:50.099 align:start position:0%
I struggled as a transgender child
 
02:15:52.669 --> 02:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
who couldn't attend school as the gender
 
02:15:55.010 --> 02:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
I identify as
 
02:15:57.770 --> 02:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
I was a depressed child and a poor
 
02:16:00.530 --> 02:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
performer in school I was also a target
 
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
for school bullies
 
02:16:05.510 --> 02:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
as I was a feminine boy
 
02:16:07.729 --> 02:16:07.739 align:start position:0%
without the ability to come out as a
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
transgender woman or girl at the time
 
02:16:14.149 --> 02:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
or suppress hormones during my puberty
 
02:16:17.089 --> 02:16:17.099 align:start position:0%
years I became depressed and gender
 
02:16:20.089 --> 02:16:20.099 align:start position:0%
confused as an adult
 
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
hormone blockers weren't available back
 
02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
then and I'm not sure if I would have
 
02:16:29.750 --> 02:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:31.790 --> 02:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
during the three years following High
 
02:16:34.490 --> 02:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
School I misused alcohol
 
02:16:36.889 --> 02:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
and totaled two cars
 
02:16:39.469 --> 02:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
while driving in Paris I'm grateful to
 
02:16:40.969 --> 02:16:40.979 align:start position:0%
be here today
 
02:16:43.790 --> 02:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
in this very competitive World a child
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
needs every Advantage they can get to
 
02:16:49.610 --> 02:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
get the best job available a transgender
 
02:16:52.669 --> 02:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
child and their parents have a lot more
 
02:16:55.070 --> 02:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
information available
 
02:16:58.009 --> 02:16:58.019 align:start position:0%
to them as they grow
 
02:16:58.019 --> 02:16:59.770 align:start position:0%
to them as they grow
especially

02:16:59.770 --> 02:16:59.780 align:start position:0%
especially
 
02:17:05.450 --> 02:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
when I was 50 years ago in school
 
02:17:07.370 --> 02:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
if you think keeping teachers from
 
02:17:09.469 --> 02:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
talking about transgender people or
 
02:17:11.810 --> 02:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
limiting access to library books will
 
02:17:13.610 --> 02:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
stop children from learning about their
 
02:17:15.770 --> 02:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
condition think again
 
02:17:18.830 --> 02:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
the internet is here it has a wealth of
 
02:17:20.450 --> 02:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
knowledge available to transgender
 
02:17:23.810 --> 02:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
children and their parents
 
02:17:25.129 --> 02:17:25.139 align:start position:0%
I know
 
02:17:28.669 --> 02:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
Lynn Conway and you probably know her as
 
02:17:32.330 --> 02:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
well when you use your phone or use your
 
02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
PC she was one of the people who
 
02:17:39.709 --> 02:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
patented the process of creating vlsi
 
02:17:42.410 --> 02:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
chips that are in any of our devices
 
02:17:45.049 --> 02:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
that we use these days
 
02:17:45.059 --> 02:17:46.549 align:start position:0%
that we use these days
yeah

02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:17:49.849 --> 02:17:49.859 align:start position:0%
she was a transgender woman
 
02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
in the past 10 years
 
02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
the number of medical professionals with
 
02:17:56.690 --> 02:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
transgender expertise in the Northeast
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
has grown dramatically
 
02:18:01.490 --> 02:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
these professionals our work are aware
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
of the DSM the diagnostic and
 
02:18:06.530 --> 02:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
statistical manual on mental disorders
 
02:18:09.530 --> 02:18:09.540 align:start position:0%

children and adults

children should be children and families
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
should be working with gender

transition procedures are rarely
 
02:18:41.089 --> 02:18:41.099 align:start position:0%
performed until a child turns 18 years
 
02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
old and can make their own decision

HP 16
 
02:18:54.709 --> 02:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
8619 presents a lot of information about
 
02:18:59.209 --> 02:18:59.219 align:start position:0%
all aspects of transgender adult care
 
02:19:02.030 --> 02:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
the section concerning transgender youth
 
02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
Health Care is substantially inaccurate
 
02:19:07.310 --> 02:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
as it includes surgical procedures and
 
02:19:10.310 --> 02:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
hormone treatments typically initiated
 
02:19:13.669 --> 02:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
when a child turns 18 and the child then
 
02:19:16.490 --> 02:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
adult can make the decisions about their
 
02:19:18.410 --> 02:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
health care
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
my biggest problem with this bill is
 
02:19:23.209 --> 02:19:23.219 align:start position:0%
that it discriminates against a very
 
02:19:26.750 --> 02:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
small minority of students in New
 
02:19:29.089 --> 02:19:29.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the total population of
 
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
transgender people is somewhere around 4
 
02:19:34.150 --> 02:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
500 people or
 
02:19:37.849 --> 02:19:37.859 align:start position:0%
0.43 of our population
 
02:19:40.429 --> 02:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
why is this bill just focused on
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
transgender students
 
02:19:47.389 --> 02:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
why wasn't focused on any child that's
 
02:19:49.910 --> 02:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
getting therapy and medication in
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
elementary school
 
02:19:55.990 --> 02:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
this transgender students
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
have the same same challenges
 
02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:01.370 align:start position:0%
have the same same challenges
sorry

02:20:01.370 --> 02:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:20:03.710 --> 02:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
this bill will force the state to break
 
02:20:07.310 --> 02:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
our own statutes our own laws that are
 
02:20:09.230 --> 02:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
in place to protect transgender people
 
02:20:12.650 --> 02:20:12.660 align:start position:0%

even today there is legislation being
 
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
proposed in this house to vilify parents
 
02:20:43.429 --> 02:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
who care about their transgender

children
 
02:20:47.150 --> 02:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
we have legislation being heard to make
 
02:20:49.070 --> 02:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
sure parental rights are honored by
 
02:20:50.809 --> 02:20:50.819 align:start position:0%
schools when they should know what is
 
02:20:52.670 --> 02:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
happening in schools
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
this bill is about taking parental
 
02:20:59.210 --> 02:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
rights away when they want to take care
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
of their children this is crazy
 
02:21:06.530 --> 02:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
this bill mentions faith in the bill it
 
02:21:08.450 --> 02:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
implies that faith is an important part
 
02:21:11.210 --> 02:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
of educating transgender children and
 
02:21:13.429 --> 02:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
maybe parents of transgender children
 
02:21:16.370 --> 02:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
aren't teaching Faith to their children
 
02:21:19.849 --> 02:21:19.859 align:start position:0%
what faith is this bill talking about I
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
am a Christian
 
02:21:24.770 --> 02:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
in my UCC Church welcomes transgender
 
02:21:27.170 --> 02:21:27.180 align:start position:0%
children and their families so does the
 
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
Episcopal Church some Methodist churches
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
synagogues and many others
 
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
the last time I checked We Are All God's
 
02:21:35.880 --> 02:21:36.830 align:start position:0%
the last time I checked We Are All God's
Children

02:21:36.830 --> 02:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
Children
 
02:21:39.770 --> 02:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
we are taught to love one another and
 
02:21:41.750 --> 02:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
our neighbors
 
02:21:44.450 --> 02:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
this bill shows no love for transgender
 
02:21:47.929 --> 02:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:50.950 --> 02:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
finally this bill is government
 
02:21:53.630 --> 02:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
intrusion into the lives of transgender
 
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
children and their families
 
02:21:59.870 --> 02:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
the last time I checked we don't live in
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
a state-controlled society
 
02:22:05.990 --> 02:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
the care of our children is best left in
 
02:22:07.730 --> 02:22:07.740 align:start position:0%
the hands of their parents and Health
 
02:22:11.210 --> 02:22:11.220 align:start position:0%

02:22:17.150 --> 02:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
that's essentially the decision we're
 
02:22:19.490 --> 02:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
giving our transgender kids
 
02:22:21.950 --> 02:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
they really ought to be living free

strongly testify opposition to
um

02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:05.690 --> 02:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
I remember being a child in the older
 
02:23:08.270 --> 02:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
than 11 crying and sobbing in the mirror
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
and lamenting over the fact that
 
02:23:11.450 --> 02:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
something has happened to my body that
 
02:23:13.130 --> 02:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
was not right
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
I wasn't supposed to look like this and
 
02:23:17.570 --> 02:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
I held my mother tight and I begged her
 
02:23:19.429 --> 02:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
to make it stop that I did not want to
 
02:23:21.889 --> 02:23:21.899 align:start position:0%
live this way did I said I did not want
 
02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
to grow up it would take me another five
 
02:23:25.790 --> 02:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
years to learn that it wasn't that I was
 
02:23:27.770 --> 02:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
scared to grow up I was scared to be in
 
02:23:29.389 --> 02:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
a body that didn't reflect my truest
 
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
self and I was scared to be trapped for
 
02:23:32.450 --> 02:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
the rest of my life
 
02:23:34.370 --> 02:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
I was never given the tools and language
 
02:23:36.530 --> 02:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
to describe that feeling that didn't
 
02:23:39.410 --> 02:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
stop me from being trans a trans kid it
 
02:23:41.090 --> 02:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
didn't stop me from feeling loss and
 
02:23:43.550 --> 02:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
displacement it only kept me confused
 
02:23:45.410 --> 02:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
and unaware that my experiences are
 
02:23:47.690 --> 02:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
shared by hundreds of thousands I
 
02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
grieved the confused and unaware or
 
02:23:51.170 --> 02:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
sorry I agree with the possibilities
 
02:23:53.450 --> 02:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
that could have been now my only option
 
02:23:55.250 --> 02:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
to find Solace is behind over a hundred
 
02:23:56.690 --> 02:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in medical costs
 
02:23:58.790 --> 02:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
years-long referral process and time
 
02:24:01.130 --> 02:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
away from my education and job there are
 
02:24:04.130 --> 02:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
met those in favor of this bill seem to
 
02:24:05.510 --> 02:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
only care about the pain if the
 
02:24:07.070 --> 02:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
individual in question isn't trans
 
02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:07.969 align:start position:0%
individual in question isn't trans
though

02:24:07.969 --> 02:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
though
 
02:24:09.710 --> 02:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
when I first came out I quickly heard
 
02:24:11.929 --> 02:24:11.939 align:start position:0%
Notch mention it around children my
 
02:24:14.150 --> 02:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
existence was rated X belong behind a
 
02:24:15.950 --> 02:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
black sensor bar last night in danger
 
02:24:18.170 --> 02:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
the children around me what about the
 
02:24:20.030 --> 02:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
children who were like me what about
 
02:24:21.349 --> 02:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
that kid crying in the mirror and
 
02:24:22.910 --> 02:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
clutching their mother in a way that
 
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
they had never before how much of that
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
anger and confusion could have been
 
02:24:29.270 --> 02:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
prevented if I had somebody like me then
 
02:24:31.370 --> 02:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
what if I saw trans princesses in my
 
02:24:33.230 --> 02:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
fairy tales non-binary teachers in my
 
02:24:35.510 --> 02:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
classes any sort of insinuation that our
 
02:24:37.790 --> 02:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
lives were more than a joke what if we
 
02:24:40.370 --> 02:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
have spent not spent so long wanting to
 
02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:41.570 align:start position:0%
have spent not spent so long wanting to
die

02:24:41.570 --> 02:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
die
 
02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of anti-trans ideology
 
02:24:46.010 --> 02:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
comes from a fear of the unknown that
 
02:24:47.330 --> 02:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
people don't want their children to be
 
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
too different from them or don't want to
 
02:24:50.750 --> 02:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
have struggles that they are unfamiliar
 
02:24:53.090 --> 02:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
with a raising trans people from every
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
place you can from the medical system to
 
02:24:57.410 --> 02:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
our school system will not prevent your
 
02:24:59.570 --> 02:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
children from being trans it will only
 
02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
prevent them from knowing who they are
 
02:25:03.710 --> 02:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
and finding their Joy these bills will

citizens children and adults alike
 
02:25:12.590 --> 02:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
love your children embrace them as their
 
02:25:14.270 --> 02:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
truest self and you'll find they will
 
02:25:16.250 --> 02:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
embrace you in return we've heard
 
02:25:18.530 --> 02:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
stories of parents saying that their
 
02:25:20.929 --> 02:25:20.939 align:start position:0%
child being trans ruined their
 
02:25:22.250 --> 02:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
relationship and that's why it's a
 
02:25:22.260 --> 02:25:22.610 align:start position:0%
relationship and that's why it's a
problem

02:25:22.610 --> 02:25:22.620 align:start position:0%

that's beyond the child being trans
 
02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
we've heard people claim that we need to
 
02:25:32.570 --> 02:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
protect a gene pool we're talking about
 
02:25:35.630 --> 02:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
Eugenics which is incredibly weird and
 
02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:37.429 align:start position:0%
Eugenics which is incredibly weird and
hypocritical

02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
hypocritical
 
02:25:40.550 --> 02:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
just gotta say it um
 
02:25:44.090 --> 02:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
yeah we need to embrace trans children
 
02:25:46.010 --> 02:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
as their truest self and they will
 
02:25:47.630 --> 02:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
embrace you in return
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
my mom is here with me today and I
 
02:25:51.530 --> 02:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
couldn't be happy because if you could
 
02:25:53.150 --> 02:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
please start wrapping up you've got 15
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
seconds got it
 
02:25:56.929 --> 02:25:56.939 align:start position:0%
um anybody of live trans experience will
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
tell you that the misinformation in this
 
02:26:00.349 --> 02:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
bill is extensive both about our health
 
02:26:01.790 --> 02:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
care and the people who we are to begin
 
02:26:03.950 --> 02:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
with this bill claims the statements
 
02:26:05.809 --> 02:26:05.819 align:start position:0%
made in our scientifically backed
 
02:26:07.969 --> 02:26:07.979 align:start position:0%
despite citing no sources five minutes
 
02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
and Google will show you dozens of
 
02:26:11.090 --> 02:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed studies that debunk the
 
02:26:13.790 --> 02:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
many claims transition education saves
 
02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:15.600 align:start position:0%

next signed up to speak is Bill Bloom to
 
02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
be followed by Don Johnson
 
02:26:42.650 --> 02:26:42.660 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone my name is Bill
 
02:26:44.510 --> 02:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
Blum and I strongly oppose this bill
 
02:26:46.910 --> 02:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
today's more so than ever the trans
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
Community is facing continued attacks
 
02:26:51.770 --> 02:26:51.780 align:start position:0%
based on fear
 
02:26:53.330 --> 02:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
and not facts
 
02:26:55.490 --> 02:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
more specifically our young marginalized
 
02:26:56.990 --> 02:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
community members who do not have the
 
02:26:58.550 --> 02:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
right to vote yet
 
02:27:00.889 --> 02:27:00.899 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to also give a voice to the
 
02:27:00.899 --> 02:27:02.450 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to also give a voice to the
silent

02:27:02.450 --> 02:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
silent
 
02:27:05.510 --> 02:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
these are our kids who are our neighbors
 
02:27:07.790 --> 02:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
our community members
 
02:27:10.370 --> 02:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
and our future leaders
 
02:27:12.170 --> 02:27:12.180 align:start position:0%
some will say that changing one's gender
 
02:27:13.610 --> 02:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
is something that should be reserved to
 
02:27:16.130 --> 02:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
only someone who is over 18.
 
02:27:18.889 --> 02:27:18.899 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how someone who is 17 is
 
02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
unable to make these decisions and
 
02:27:23.690 --> 02:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
someone who is over 18 is
 
02:27:26.330 --> 02:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
so I will rely on the experts to make
 
02:27:28.969 --> 02:27:28.979 align:start position:0%
that choice
 
02:27:31.070 --> 02:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
if I'm to speak on numbers there are
 
02:27:33.170 --> 02:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
approximately 1.4 million people who
 
02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
live in the state of New Hampshire and
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
18 of that are under 18 years of age or
 
02:27:42.710 --> 02:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
approximately 259 000 give or take
 
02:27:44.270 --> 02:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
if I'm to take National numbers and
 
02:27:46.910 --> 02:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
apply them to the state
 
02:27:49.130 --> 02:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
the trans population nationally is
 
02:27:50.450 --> 02:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
around one percent
 
02:27:52.849 --> 02:27:52.859 align:start position:0%
so therefore in state of New Hampshire
 
02:27:55.370 --> 02:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
it's about 25 2600 people that
 
02:27:58.849 --> 02:27:58.859 align:start position:0%
identified as trans individuals
 
02:28:01.250 --> 02:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
although the number may seem small
 
02:28:03.410 --> 02:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
I will say that when one suffers we all
 
02:28:03.420 --> 02:28:05.090 align:start position:0%
I will say that when one suffers we all
suffer

02:28:05.090 --> 02:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
suffer
 
02:28:06.950 --> 02:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
Additionally the American Medical
 
02:28:09.830 --> 02:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
Association members are 1.4 million
 
02:28:11.750 --> 02:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
people which is very close to the total
 
02:28:13.309 --> 02:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
population of the state
 
02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
agree that providing gender affirming
 
02:28:18.050 --> 02:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
care is what is in the best interest of
 
02:28:19.550 --> 02:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
the children I'll say that again in case
 
02:28:21.170 --> 02:28:21.180 align:start position:0%
you're on your phones
 
02:28:23.809 --> 02:28:23.819 align:start position:0%
the entire state population of New
 
02:28:25.790 --> 02:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is also
 
02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
equivalent to the American Medical
 
02:28:30.410 --> 02:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
Association community that says that
 
02:28:32.389 --> 02:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
gender affirmative care is the right
 
02:28:33.889 --> 02:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
02:28:36.710 --> 02:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
but I will not leave space for is a tax
 
02:28:38.510 --> 02:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
on our children's basic human rights
 
02:28:40.429 --> 02:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
during my time here I've learned that if
 
02:28:42.349 --> 02:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
you're to find a successful Society one
 
02:28:44.570 --> 02:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
key indicator is to look at the children
 
02:28:46.969 --> 02:28:46.979 align:start position:0%
if the kids are educated healthy and
 
02:28:48.590 --> 02:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
thriving then the society is inherently
 
02:28:51.230 --> 02:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
good if there's conflict of War then the
 
02:28:52.910 --> 02:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
kids are malnourished deprived of a good
 
02:28:55.790 --> 02:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
education and clean water we're living
 
02:28:55.800 --> 02:28:56.690 align:start position:0%
education and clean water we're living
in

02:28:56.690 --> 02:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:28:58.849 --> 02:28:58.859 align:start position:0%
who are living in fear of their lives so
 
02:29:00.889 --> 02:29:00.899 align:start position:0%
I ask you why are we choosing to harm
 
02:29:03.170 --> 02:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
the children and incur harm to their
 
02:29:04.670 --> 02:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
civil rights in existence that
 
02:29:06.889 --> 02:29:06.899 align:start position:0%
discriminates based on gender identity
 
02:29:09.469 --> 02:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
and at the same time not allow one to
 
02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's like saying guns are legal to own
 
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
and use however you can never buy one or
 
02:29:20.809 --> 02:29:20.819 align:start position:0%
even make one
 
02:29:22.370 --> 02:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
please stop with this outrageous and
 
02:29:24.290 --> 02:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
hurtful legislation that goes against
 
02:29:26.090 --> 02:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
The Proven experts and let's start
 
02:29:27.830 --> 02:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
focusing on things that really can make
 
02:29:29.090 --> 02:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
a difference
 
02:29:31.370 --> 02:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you you're welcome
 
02:29:33.590 --> 02:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
you're taking questions absolutely any
 
02:29:35.870 --> 02:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
I'm saying thank you

next up to speak is Don Johnson to be

have a brief statement um

in regards to
 
02:30:10.190 --> 02:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
um a comment that was made based off of
 
02:30:12.650 --> 02:30:12.660 align:start position:0%
off of the Bible
 
02:30:16.370 --> 02:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
today we've heard testimony that
 
02:30:18.469 --> 02:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
from doctors
 
02:30:21.530 --> 02:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
well we all know that the doctors
 
02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
maybe not all of them but many of them
 
02:30:27.349 --> 02:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
have created the opioid crisis that we
 
02:30:30.230 --> 02:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
have today throughout the country
 
02:30:33.349 --> 02:30:33.359 align:start position:0%

this is not to attack our doctors

this is to remind us that they are human

02:31:32.270 --> 02:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
we should be following that is based on
 
02:31:35.389 --> 02:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
the Bible that is based on the laws that
 
02:31:38.510 --> 02:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
this country and this world was founded
 
02:31:38.520 --> 02:31:39.590 align:start position:0%
this country and this world was founded
on

02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:31:43.130 --> 02:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
and if we cannot follow the Commandments
 
02:31:46.429 --> 02:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
then we must pray for those who cannot
 
02:31:49.070 --> 02:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
and hopefully they see the light God
 
02:31:52.910 --> 02:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:55.010 --> 02:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you

it's Athena actually uh my name is
 
02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
jacobowitz I'm a transgender woman from
 
02:32:15.410 --> 02:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
uh Massachusetts I've been doing
 
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:22.190 --> 02:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
um and honestly you've all heard a bunch
 
02:32:24.050 --> 02:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
of people already today like you've
 
02:32:25.790 --> 02:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
heard every doctor and every trans
 
02:32:28.790 --> 02:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
person be pretty aligned with how we
 
02:32:31.190 --> 02:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
feel we should be treated by the law
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
so I want to talk to you about something
 
02:32:34.250 --> 02:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
real personal
 
02:32:37.490 --> 02:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh about why it's important for kids to
 
02:32:38.570 --> 02:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
be able to talk about their gender
 
02:32:41.690 --> 02:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:43.550 --> 02:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
I came out and I figured out my vendor
 
02:32:46.610 --> 02:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
about 15 years ago and the world was not
 
02:32:48.170 --> 02:32:48.180 align:start position:0%
nearly as
 
02:32:51.349 --> 02:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh as accepting of trans people then
 
02:32:51.359 --> 02:32:52.730 align:start position:0%
uh as accepting of trans people then
uh

02:32:52.730 --> 02:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
forgive me this is
 
02:32:56.809 --> 02:32:56.819 align:start position:0%
a little hard and I didn't have anybody
 
02:32:58.250 --> 02:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
to talk to
 
02:32:59.690 --> 02:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
at all
 
02:33:01.250 --> 02:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
and I was the first generation of
 
02:33:03.650 --> 02:33:03.660 align:start position:0%
Internet kids you know I had dial up I
 
02:33:06.349 --> 02:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
played Neopets uh
 
02:33:09.770 --> 02:33:09.780 align:start position:0%
and so when I had nobody in my life to
 
02:33:11.450 --> 02:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
support me and I didn't know if I could
 
02:33:13.309 --> 02:33:13.319 align:start position:0%
tell my parents or not because I knew
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
that sometimes you get disowned if you
 
02:33:17.030 --> 02:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
tell your parents that you're trans
 
02:33:19.190 --> 02:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
so so often they're not the first people
 
02:33:20.929 --> 02:33:20.939 align:start position:0%
that you go to if you're not sure if
 
02:33:22.309 --> 02:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
they're safe sometimes you want to go to
 
02:33:24.650 --> 02:33:24.660 align:start position:0%
like a trusted teacher or something
 
02:33:26.450 --> 02:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
I didn't have any of those
 
02:33:27.860 --> 02:33:27.870 align:start position:0%
instead I went on the internet
 
02:33:27.870 --> 02:33:31.010 align:start position:0%
instead I went on the internet
[Music]

02:33:31.010 --> 02:33:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:33.230 --> 02:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
and I was about 17
 
02:33:36.770 --> 02:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
I can't Maybe 15.
 
02:33:38.570 --> 02:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
I have a lot of missing memories from
 
02:33:39.710 --> 02:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
this period of time that I'm still
 
02:33:41.090 --> 02:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
sorting through
 
02:33:43.790 --> 02:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
I knew that I was different
 
02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
I went online I found somebody who
 
02:33:47.450 --> 02:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
understood that I was different
 
02:33:49.429 --> 02:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this person was not a good
 
02:33:49.439 --> 02:33:50.690 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this person was not a good
person

02:33:50.690 --> 02:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
and they figured out
 
02:33:55.010 --> 02:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
that I would what I was before I did and
 
02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
they figured out that that gave them
 
02:33:58.130 --> 02:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
power over me because if they were the
 
02:34:00.889 --> 02:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
only person in my life who uh who
 
02:34:02.929 --> 02:34:02.939 align:start position:0%
recognized me as a woman and they could
 
02:34:05.210 --> 02:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
convince me to keep myself closeted and
 
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
isolate myself that uh then because they
 
02:34:10.550 --> 02:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
were the only person who was giving me
 
02:34:12.110 --> 02:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
something I needed they could manipulate
 
02:34:14.030 --> 02:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
me for sexual favors
 
02:34:16.730 --> 02:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
and they absolutely did from uh again
 
02:34:20.389 --> 02:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
this person was 42 I know I was 17 when
 
02:34:22.730 --> 02:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
things started uh
 
02:34:25.730 --> 02:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
turning sexual I know that it really
 
02:34:28.130 --> 02:34:28.140 align:start position:0%
badly damaged me
 
02:34:31.190 --> 02:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
if you pass this bill
 
02:34:33.290 --> 02:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
stuff like that is going to happen more
 
02:34:33.300 --> 02:34:34.910 align:start position:0%
stuff like that is going to happen more
because

02:34:34.910 --> 02:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:34:36.889 --> 02:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
you're you'll be taking away so many
 
02:34:39.170 --> 02:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
people that uh
 
02:34:41.150 --> 02:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
in their actual lives that kids can go
 
02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
and talk to about what's going on with
 
02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:44.870 align:start position:0%
and talk to about what's going on with
them

02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:34:47.150 --> 02:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
and you'll be forcing them to go look
 
02:34:50.750 --> 02:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
for answers elsewhere because I I was
 
02:34:52.730 --> 02:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
never going to stop being trans and I
 
02:34:53.809 --> 02:34:53.819 align:start position:0%
was never going to stop having the
 
02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
questions about myself that I had
 
02:34:57.950 --> 02:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
and eventually I found people who are
 
02:34:59.330 --> 02:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
able to help me and give me the answers
 
02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
that I needed without trying to take
 
02:35:03.349 --> 02:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
advantage of me I'm not trans because
 
02:35:05.450 --> 02:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
this uh shitty man on the internet took
 
02:35:06.770 --> 02:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
advantage of me
 
02:35:08.570 --> 02:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
but I am a sexual assault Survivor
 
02:35:09.950 --> 02:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
because of that
 
02:35:11.870 --> 02:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we want that happening
 
02:35:13.610 --> 02:35:13.620 align:start position:0%
to kids
 
02:35:15.590 --> 02:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
so that's why I'm asking you
 
02:35:18.469 --> 02:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
don't let this bill through
 
02:35:21.410 --> 02:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
this will create more victims of sexual
 
02:35:24.050 --> 02:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
violence if you vote vote Yes on this
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%

02:35:37.010 --> 02:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
after we get all the treatment and care
 
02:35:38.750 --> 02:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
that we need
 
02:35:42.230 --> 02:35:42.240 align:start position:0%

Joyce is our third and youngest child
 
02:37:51.290 --> 02:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
she was the missing puzzle piece in our
 
02:37:52.730 --> 02:37:52.740 align:start position:0%
family and brought all of us together
 
02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
with her abundance of love
 
02:37:57.710 --> 02:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
from the time any personality showed and
 
02:38:00.290 --> 02:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
until she turned 15 she'd always have
 
02:38:03.070 --> 02:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
been best described as happy-go-lucky
 
02:38:07.130 --> 02:38:07.140 align:start position:0%
Carefree friendly and really funny
 
02:38:10.550 --> 02:38:10.560 align:start position:0%

completely dark
 
02:38:22.010 --> 02:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
I don't want to share too many personal
 
02:38:24.290 --> 02:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
details of her journey or of our
 
02:38:26.570 --> 02:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
family's experience publicly and will
 
02:38:28.490 --> 02:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
not answer questions today but if you
 
02:38:30.170 --> 02:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
are inclined I will provide my email
 
02:38:32.090 --> 02:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
address and we'll answer questions if
 
02:38:34.550 --> 02:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
you have them
 
02:38:36.590 --> 02:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
I will tell you though that this journey
 
02:38:39.889 --> 02:38:39.899 align:start position:0%
has been all the things
 
02:38:42.710 --> 02:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
but those particular years were all the
 
02:38:45.170 --> 02:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
really hard things
 
02:38:48.070 --> 02:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
coming to coming out
 
02:38:50.690 --> 02:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
honoring and embracing your truth is a
 
02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
different experience for everyone
 
02:38:55.550 --> 02:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
Joyce's was particularly painful we had
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
to take her out of school and at one low
 
02:38:59.270 --> 02:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
point we spent almost a week in the
 
02:39:01.010 --> 02:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
hospital's emergency room held without
 
02:39:02.690 --> 02:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
care or treatment
 
02:39:05.210 --> 02:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
I say we because I slept in that bed
 
02:39:07.010 --> 02:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
with her every night
 
02:39:10.610 --> 02:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
as parents we did all the things we
 
02:39:12.830 --> 02:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
questioned we researched we Enlisted the
 
02:39:14.690 --> 02:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
help of therapists and Specialists we
 
02:39:17.210 --> 02:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
doubted we cried we learned we
 
02:39:19.790 --> 02:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
deliberated with caution care and
 
02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:20.809 align:start position:0%
deliberated with caution care and
diligence

02:39:20.809 --> 02:39:20.819 align:start position:0%
diligence
 
02:39:23.349 --> 02:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
while she slowly at her own pace
 
02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
transitioned socially and over time we
 
02:39:29.630 --> 02:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
came to know and embrace this truth of
 
02:39:32.270 --> 02:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
who our child was we found a school that
 
02:39:34.610 --> 02:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
honored and supported her and once she
 
02:39:36.050 --> 02:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
had socially transitioned for
 
02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
predetermined time and under the care of
 
02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
medical professionals we agreed that it
 
02:39:42.290 --> 02:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
was time to introduce gender affirming
 
02:39:42.300 --> 02:39:44.030 align:start position:0%
was time to introduce gender affirming
medicine

02:39:44.030 --> 02:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
02:39:47.270 --> 02:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
and that was when her light began to
 
02:39:48.950 --> 02:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
shine again
 
02:39:54.410 --> 02:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:56.389 --> 02:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
and a high school senior
 
02:39:58.429 --> 02:39:58.439 align:start position:0%
she is a valued member of her school
 
02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
Community respected by her peers and
 
02:40:01.969 --> 02:40:01.979 align:start position:0%
teachers alike
 
02:40:04.969 --> 02:40:04.979 align:start position:0%
she is a servant leader wise gentle and
 
02:40:07.250 --> 02:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
compassionate most of the time she's
 
02:40:09.290 --> 02:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
happy-go-lucky carefree and really funny
 
02:40:10.849 --> 02:40:10.859 align:start position:0%
again too
 
02:40:13.490 --> 02:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
although the road ahead mostly due to
 
02:40:16.130 --> 02:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
outside forces such as bills like this
 
02:40:19.370 --> 02:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
one will be challenging we are so
 
02:40:21.530 --> 02:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
grateful to watch her future unfold just
 
02:40:24.349 --> 02:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
as any parent does at this milestone
 
02:40:26.510 --> 02:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care in both medicine
 
02:40:28.910 --> 02:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
and in the classroom very likely saved
 
02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
our daughter's life
 
02:40:32.270 --> 02:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
we are good present and dedicated
 
02:40:34.429 --> 02:40:34.439 align:start position:0%
parents and it is our opinion that if
 
02:40:37.130 --> 02:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
this Bill had passed five years ago we
 
02:40:39.050 --> 02:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
would have held a funeral
 
02:40:41.270 --> 02:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
rather than her graduation party this
 
02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:42.050 align:start position:0%
rather than her graduation party this
summer

02:40:42.050 --> 02:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
summer
 
02:40:44.330 --> 02:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
we ask you please don't interfere with
 
02:40:46.490 --> 02:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
the medical decisions between a doctor a
 
02:40:48.290 --> 02:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
patient and their parents
 
02:40:50.929 --> 02:40:50.939 align:start position:0%
and please don't put up more barriers to
 
02:40:52.969 --> 02:40:52.979 align:start position:0%
them in their important social and
 
02:40:54.950 --> 02:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
school Community by prohibiting or
 
02:40:56.690 --> 02:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
restricting teachers from supporting
 
02:40:57.710 --> 02:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
these kids
 
02:41:01.429 --> 02:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
please vote in expedient to legislate on
 
02:41:04.010 --> 02:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
House Bill 619 thank you
 
02:41:06.950 --> 02:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:41:10.210 --> 02:41:10.220 align:start position:0%
next we have Sharon Boyd followed by
 
02:41:14.929 --> 02:41:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:16.849 --> 02:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
happy Tuesday everyone
 
02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
my name is Sharon Boyd I'm from Chester
 
02:41:21.410 --> 02:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm opposed to this
 
02:41:24.050 --> 02:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
legislation please excuse my appearance
 
02:41:26.330 --> 02:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
I was expecting to show support today
 
02:41:29.450 --> 02:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
but not actually speak to you all
 
02:41:32.030 --> 02:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you for working through lunch
 
02:41:34.670 --> 02:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
and yes I am a transgender woman my
 
02:41:37.429 --> 02:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
pronouns are she her
 
02:41:41.090 --> 02:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
at 10 I knew something was wrong
 
02:41:43.490 --> 02:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
I didn't have the words for it my brain
 
02:41:46.309 --> 02:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
didn't have to be fully developed for me
 
02:41:49.730 --> 02:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
to know that something was wrong
 
02:41:52.670 --> 02:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
I graduated from the United States Naval
 
02:41:55.429 --> 02:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
Academy at 21. I served as a naval
 
02:41:58.130 --> 02:41:58.140 align:start position:0%
officer for eight years the entire time
 
02:42:00.110 --> 02:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
if I had come out I would have had a
 
02:42:02.570 --> 02:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
dishonorable discharge overnight and I
 
02:42:04.010 --> 02:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
probably would have gotten beaten to it
 
02:42:06.770 --> 02:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
in an inch of my life
 
02:42:09.889 --> 02:42:09.899 align:start position:0%
I started transitioning last year
 
02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
my grandson lives in Arkansas he's 15.
 
02:42:16.490 --> 02:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
he's trans
 
02:42:19.429 --> 02:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
he came out just before I did I didn't
 
02:42:21.050 --> 02:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
know he was going to come out and he
 
02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
didn't know I was going to come out
 
02:42:27.710 --> 02:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:31.070 --> 02:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
he attempted suicide three weeks ago
 
02:42:33.469 --> 02:42:33.479 align:start position:0%
he's okay
 
02:42:35.570 --> 02:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
he was bullied in school
 
02:42:38.210 --> 02:42:38.220 align:start position:0%
mostly about
 
02:42:41.210 --> 02:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
the prospect of detransitioning as it
 
02:42:45.290 --> 02:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
looks like Arkansas is about to mandate
 
02:42:47.389 --> 02:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
if he was in New Hampshire
 
02:42:49.969 --> 02:42:49.979 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire without this legislation
 
02:42:52.610 --> 02:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
going through I think he would never
 
02:42:54.590 --> 02:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
have attempted suicide I think you'd be
 
02:42:57.530 --> 02:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:00.230 --> 02:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
I can't make you all
 
02:43:02.270 --> 02:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
truly understand
 
02:43:05.510 --> 02:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
how it feels to have your body not match
 
02:43:08.210 --> 02:43:08.220 align:start position:0%
your identity
 
02:43:10.309 --> 02:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
I just don't have the words for it and
 
02:43:13.070 --> 02:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
Lord knows I've tried
 
02:43:15.770 --> 02:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
goodness knows the kids don't have those
 
02:43:18.530 --> 02:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
words for it they can't communicate
 
02:43:21.889 --> 02:43:21.899 align:start position:0%
other than something is wrong and that's
 
02:43:24.710 --> 02:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
even with the internet showing them
 
02:43:28.730 --> 02:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:30.889 --> 02:43:30.899 align:start position:0%
please don't deny
 
02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
these children
 
02:43:36.469 --> 02:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
what they need while you seek an
 
02:43:39.050 --> 02:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
understanding of what it means to be
 
02:43:42.050 --> 02:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
transgender when you are never going to
 
02:43:43.969 --> 02:43:43.979 align:start position:0%
be able to have that visceral
 
02:43:48.290 --> 02:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:51.050 --> 02:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
and a few people have said well
 
02:43:52.969 --> 02:43:52.979 align:start position:0%
kids can wait till they're 18 to make
 
02:43:56.510 --> 02:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:59.630 --> 02:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
you will never understand also
 
02:44:01.550 --> 02:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
how painful it is
 
02:44:03.770 --> 02:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
to children
 
02:44:07.070 --> 02:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
that are experiencing a puberty that
 
02:44:12.349 --> 02:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:16.670 --> 02:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
forcing them to delay the decision until
 
02:44:19.490 --> 02:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
their brain is fully formed is
 
02:44:22.190 --> 02:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
tantamount to making an extremely
 
02:44:25.550 --> 02:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
painful decision for them because they
 
02:44:28.910 --> 02:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
are going to endure a puberty that is
 
02:44:31.370 --> 02:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
itself irreversible that they don't want
 
02:44:34.610 --> 02:44:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:37.849 --> 02:44:37.859 align:start position:0%
and I'm open to questions
 
02:44:39.969 --> 02:44:39.979 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
02:44:43.790 --> 02:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
next now we have Brady Berry and up up
 
02:44:50.630 --> 02:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
after that is Mr rosivi
 
02:44:52.070 --> 02:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:44:54.349 --> 02:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
um and good afternoon my name is Brady
 
02:44:56.450 --> 02:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
Berry I'm a senior social work student
 
02:44:58.370 --> 02:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
at the University of New Hampshire in
 
02:44:58.380 --> 02:44:59.450 align:start position:0%
at the University of New Hampshire in
Durham

02:44:59.450 --> 02:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
Durham
 
02:45:01.370 --> 02:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here to testify in opposition
 
02:45:03.710 --> 02:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
to HB 619
 
02:45:06.050 --> 02:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
as a transgender person who has spent a
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time working with
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
transgender and non-binary kids it is
 
02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
important to me that we ensure the
 
02:45:13.969 --> 02:45:13.979 align:start position:0%
rights of this population
 
02:45:16.370 --> 02:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
aspect of this bill threatens trans kids
 
02:45:18.650 --> 02:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
in its own unique way but today I'm
 
02:45:20.750 --> 02:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
going to focus on education and the
 
02:45:23.150 --> 02:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
importance of affirming lgbtq plus
 
02:45:25.429 --> 02:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
identities in schools
 
02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
three years ago when I came out as
 
02:45:29.450 --> 02:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
transgender and changed my name and
 
02:45:32.030 --> 02:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
pronouns many people including close
 
02:45:35.030 --> 02:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
friends family and strangers told me
 
02:45:36.770 --> 02:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
there was something wrong with me
 
02:45:38.570 --> 02:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
these people would not use my chosen
 
02:45:40.849 --> 02:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
name and pronouns and actively ignored
 
02:45:43.429 --> 02:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
my identity as a transgender person
 
02:45:45.469 --> 02:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
the months of people refusing to affirm
 
02:45:48.530 --> 02:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
my identity nearly cost me my life in
 
02:45:50.270 --> 02:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
the span of six months I attempted to
 
02:45:53.090 --> 02:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
end my life twice and I'm very lucky to
 
02:45:55.250 --> 02:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
be standing before you today
 
02:45:56.990 --> 02:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
my life turned around because I had
 
02:45:58.610 --> 02:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
access to gender affirming care to start
 
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
my transition
 
02:46:01.429 --> 02:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
it turned around because I started to
 
02:46:03.950 --> 02:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
see representation both in real life and
 
02:46:05.510 --> 02:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the media of transgender people
 
02:46:07.490 --> 02:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
living their lives happily
 
02:46:09.050 --> 02:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
it turned around because I found people
 
02:46:10.849 --> 02:46:10.859 align:start position:0%
who affirmed my identity
 
02:46:12.469 --> 02:46:12.479 align:start position:0%
one of those people was a teacher of
 
02:46:14.990 --> 02:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
mine and I can't overstate the value of
 
02:46:16.849 --> 02:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
having a trusted adult in your life when
 
02:46:19.070 --> 02:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
you're young and vulnerable
 
02:46:20.690 --> 02:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
this teacher was so quick to accept
 
02:46:23.150 --> 02:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
accept me and stand up for me at a time
 
02:46:25.010 --> 02:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
when I couldn't do so for myself
 
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
she advocated on my behalf to other
 
02:46:29.090 --> 02:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
teachers and she showed me that I am
 
02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
lovable and that what part part of what
 
02:46:32.690 --> 02:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
makes me lovable is my transgender
 
02:46:32.700 --> 02:46:34.010 align:start position:0%
makes me lovable is my transgender
identity

02:46:34.010 --> 02:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
identity
 
02:46:36.170 --> 02:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
by mandating that Educators only use a
 
02:46:37.730 --> 02:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
student's birth name and the pronouns
 
02:46:39.110 --> 02:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
that matched their assigned sex at Birth
 
02:46:41.270 --> 02:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
we are removing that resource that
 
02:46:43.490 --> 02:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
changed my life by only teaching that
 
02:46:44.929 --> 02:46:44.939 align:start position:0%
there are two genders and that anything
 
02:46:46.969 --> 02:46:46.979 align:start position:0%
else is wrong where directly telling
 
02:46:48.230 --> 02:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
kids who might be questioning their
 
02:46:49.969 --> 02:46:49.979 align:start position:0%
gender that there's something wrong with
 
02:46:49.979 --> 02:46:50.990 align:start position:0%
gender that there's something wrong with
them

02:46:50.990 --> 02:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:46:53.630 --> 02:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
even at 19 these messages harmed me
 
02:46:55.969 --> 02:46:55.979 align:start position:0%
deeply so I urge you to imagine the harm
 
02:46:57.410 --> 02:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
that could be done to kids as they're
 
02:46:58.670 --> 02:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
growing up and taking in the world
 
02:47:01.130 --> 02:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
around them for these reasons I urge you
 
02:47:03.469 --> 02:47:03.479 align:start position:0%
all to oppose 619 thank you for your
 
02:47:03.479 --> 02:47:10.910 align:start position:0%
all to oppose 619 thank you for your
time

02:47:10.910 --> 02:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:13.309 --> 02:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
see and on Deck we have Jay leper
 
02:47:13.319 --> 02:47:15.349 align:start position:0%

02:47:15.349 --> 02:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
liberak
 
02:47:17.270 --> 02:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
hello and thank you for holding the
 
02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:18.770 align:start position:0%
hello and thank you for holding the
hearing

02:47:18.770 --> 02:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:47:21.650 --> 02:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
um I have a short story and then
 
02:47:24.530 --> 02:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
a little bit of an explanation when our
 
02:47:27.410 --> 02:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
son was only 11 or 12 he started to
 
02:47:29.469 --> 02:47:29.479 align:start position:0%
believe that he was a girl
 
02:47:32.150 --> 02:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
we talked to him about it asked him
 
02:47:34.389 --> 02:47:34.399 align:start position:0%
questions were very considerate I think
 
02:47:37.429 --> 02:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
we took him to an endocrinologist and a
 
02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
social worker
 
02:47:41.690 --> 02:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
who were ready to rush him into a
 
02:47:44.450 --> 02:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
transition with very very few questions
 
02:47:47.270 --> 02:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
almost none I was shocked that something
 
02:47:49.750 --> 02:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
that traumatic or drastic
 
02:47:52.969 --> 02:47:52.979 align:start position:0%
would have so few queries so a few
 
02:47:54.650 --> 02:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
questions they started to rubber stamp
 
02:47:56.030 --> 02:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
the process
 
02:47:59.750 --> 02:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
I think very luckily for us he decided
 
02:48:04.309 --> 02:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
to rethink his his decision and decided
 
02:48:07.550 --> 02:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
to stay a boy and I think that he's much
 
02:48:09.349 --> 02:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
much much better off having done this
 
02:48:11.809 --> 02:48:11.819 align:start position:0%
thinking on his own rather than being
 
02:48:14.570 --> 02:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
thrown onto a conveyor belt and
 
02:48:16.490 --> 02:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
undergone something that he would come
 
02:48:18.370 --> 02:48:18.380 align:start position:0%
to regret
 
02:48:20.990 --> 02:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
people of his age and this is the point
 
02:48:23.510 --> 02:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to make in support of this
 
02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:25.070 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to make in support of this
bill

02:48:25.070 --> 02:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:48:27.889 --> 02:48:27.899 align:start position:0%
are extremely vulnerable they're going
 
02:48:30.469 --> 02:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
to schools where they're social workers
 
02:48:34.370 --> 02:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
a whole network of psychologists Etc who
 
02:48:37.490 --> 02:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
are almost plucking them almost cherry
 
02:48:40.250 --> 02:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
picking them for this process about
 
02:48:42.110 --> 02:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
which they have very very little
 
02:48:44.210 --> 02:48:44.220 align:start position:0%
understanding as far as the consequences
 
02:48:47.870 --> 02:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
of It Go and I don't think and I agree
 
02:48:49.490 --> 02:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
with many of the people who've spoken
 
02:48:51.770 --> 02:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
earlier who have just pointed out let
 
02:48:54.050 --> 02:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
them make do the thinking do the hard
 
02:48:56.510 --> 02:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
work question themselves on their own
 
02:48:59.030 --> 02:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
for a while in conjunction with their
 
02:49:01.849 --> 02:49:01.859 align:start position:0%
parents it's I think it's critical and
 
02:49:04.130 --> 02:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
essential to have respect for them at
 
02:49:05.030 --> 02:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
that level
 
02:49:07.010 --> 02:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
rather than just steering them and
 
02:49:09.790 --> 02:49:09.800 align:start position:0%
guiding them and insisting that we know
 
02:49:12.770 --> 02:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
better medical profession knows better
 
02:49:15.050 --> 02:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
what kind of people they want to be and
 
02:49:17.889 --> 02:49:17.899 align:start position:0%
I would just end with a quote from
 
02:49:21.429 --> 02:49:21.439 align:start position:0%
excuse me from King Lear where he asks
 
02:49:25.849 --> 02:49:25.859 align:start position:0%
uh who is it who can tell me who I am
 
02:49:29.170 --> 02:49:29.180 align:start position:0%
so if a person of that caliber
 
02:49:32.510 --> 02:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
unsurpassed in Insight Shakespeare has
 
02:49:35.270 --> 02:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
questions about lear's identity
 
02:49:38.570 --> 02:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
then I would ask you what a 14 or 15
 
02:49:40.250 --> 02:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
year old be able to answer that question
 
02:49:42.170 --> 02:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
I cannot answer it myself
 
02:49:44.030 --> 02:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
so I would say
 
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
very strong support of this Bill thank
 
02:49:50.570 --> 02:49:50.580 align:start position:0%

also transgender
 
02:50:39.530 --> 02:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
I'm standing here today able to achieve
 
02:50:42.290 --> 02:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
these Feats because I was allowed to be
 
02:50:45.349 --> 02:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
who I am now and always have been I
 
02:50:47.630 --> 02:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
speak in dire opposition of House Bill
 
02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:48.950 align:start position:0%
speak in dire opposition of House Bill
619

02:50:48.950 --> 02:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
619
 
02:50:51.230 --> 02:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
I grew up in Ware New Hampshire and
 
02:50:53.150 --> 02:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
attended Public School from grades 1
 
02:50:55.670 --> 02:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
through 12. I know very well the
 
02:50:57.590 --> 02:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
disastrous effects that would come from
 
02:50:59.990 --> 02:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
the passing of this bill because I lived
 
02:51:01.010 --> 02:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
through them
 
02:51:02.690 --> 02:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
when I was in Middle School I didn't
 
02:51:05.570 --> 02:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
know what being trans was or meant as a
 
02:51:07.550 --> 02:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
gender non-conforming kid I didn't know
 
02:51:09.830 --> 02:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
what to think of myself when I was in
 
02:51:11.809 --> 02:51:11.819 align:start position:0%
fifth grade I started wearing masculine
 
02:51:14.389 --> 02:51:14.399 align:start position:0%
clothes finally I felt like who I really
 
02:51:17.630 --> 02:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
was but at the same time I felt isolated
 
02:51:21.290 --> 02:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
I didn't know anyone like me and no one
 
02:51:23.330 --> 02:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
talked about transgender identities at
 
02:51:25.250 --> 02:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
all I was certain that there was
 
02:51:26.630 --> 02:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
something wrong with me
 
02:51:28.610 --> 02:51:28.620 align:start position:0%
though I tried to faint confidence on
 
02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
the outside I felt lonely and depressed
 
02:51:33.469 --> 02:51:33.479 align:start position:0%
I thought I was such a bad person for
 
02:51:35.630 --> 02:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
being this way so when I was nearing
 
02:51:37.550 --> 02:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
eighth grade I reluctantly started
 
02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
wearing feminine clothes again after
 
02:51:41.750 --> 02:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
that I wasn't outwardly seen as
 
02:51:43.809 --> 02:51:43.819 align:start position:0%
different but I felt even more alone
 
02:51:47.090 --> 02:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
those around me were relieved that I was
 
02:51:49.730 --> 02:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
out of my face and turning into the
 
02:51:52.250 --> 02:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
woman they all expected me to be
 
02:51:54.830 --> 02:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
but that didn't work out I needed to
 
02:51:57.469 --> 02:51:57.479 align:start position:0%
live authentically but society's lack of
 
02:51:59.450 --> 02:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
acceptance and understanding surrounding
 
02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
trans identities made that feel
 
02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:02.929 align:start position:0%
trans identities made that feel
impossible

02:52:02.929 --> 02:52:02.939 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
02:52:05.450 --> 02:52:05.460 align:start position:0%
I developed an anxiety disorder because
 
02:52:07.969 --> 02:52:07.979 align:start position:0%
I thought I was such a bad person for
 
02:52:10.010 --> 02:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
being who I was
 
02:52:13.070 --> 02:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
I became very religious I prayed that
 
02:52:15.650 --> 02:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
God could save me from who I was and I
 
02:52:17.750 --> 02:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
had to found out the hard way that I
 
02:52:20.269 --> 02:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
couldn't that I couldn't be cured no
 
02:52:22.010 --> 02:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
amount of prayer or religious
 
02:52:25.370 --> 02:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
intervention could save me could fix me
 
02:52:27.230 --> 02:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
and that's because there was nothing
 
02:52:29.570 --> 02:52:29.580 align:start position:0%
wrong with me in the first place
 
02:52:31.370 --> 02:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
it was my senior year of high school
 
02:52:33.590 --> 02:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
before I began to entertain the idea of
 
02:52:36.530 --> 02:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
allowing myself to exist I graduated in
 
02:52:38.450 --> 02:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
2020 and I have since been more
 
02:52:40.309 --> 02:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
successful and happier than I've ever
 
02:52:42.349 --> 02:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
had the chance to be I've had the
 
02:52:44.150 --> 02:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
genuine confidence to make astounding
 
02:52:46.250 --> 02:52:46.260 align:start position:0%
achievements academically and otherwise
 
02:52:48.530 --> 02:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
I've long thought about what I could
 
02:52:50.570 --> 02:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
have achieved in public schools if my
 
02:52:52.610 --> 02:52:52.620 align:start position:0%
peers and I had received some level of
 
02:52:54.830 --> 02:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
education and affirmations surrounding
 
02:52:57.830 --> 02:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
trans identities instead I was left
 
02:52:59.690 --> 02:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
picking up the pieces of myself that
 
02:53:01.670 --> 02:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
were Shattered by society's expectations
 
02:53:04.790 --> 02:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
because I couldn't meet them
 
02:53:07.250 --> 02:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
I am one of the lucky ones statistically
 
02:53:09.469 --> 02:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
according to the Trevor Project four
 
02:53:11.690 --> 02:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
trans kids have attempted suicide since
 
02:53:14.030 --> 02:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
I began sharing this testimony because
 
02:53:16.969 --> 02:53:16.979 align:start position:0%
of experiences like mine were not scary
 
02:53:19.730 --> 02:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
we're not evil we're just people and
 
02:53:21.469 --> 02:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
they're just kids please leave them
 
02:53:21.479 --> 02:53:22.429 align:start position:0%
they're just kids please leave them
alone

02:53:22.429 --> 02:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
alone
 
02:53:24.650 --> 02:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
I will be taking questions
 
02:53:26.330 --> 02:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
02:53:26.340 --> 02:53:27.590 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

02:53:27.590 --> 02:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
I have a written as well thank you very
 
02:53:30.830 --> 02:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
much if you hand those up we can put
 
02:53:33.290 --> 02:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
those on the record we have a Lane Plant
 
02:53:42.650 --> 02:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:45.889 --> 02:53:45.899 align:start position:0%
sorry is the lane here
 
02:53:47.830 --> 02:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
I'll set this to the side for a moment
 
02:53:50.570 --> 02:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
Cameron Munns do we have Cameron munz in
 
02:53:54.950 --> 02:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:02.510 --> 02:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:06.650 --> 02:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:09.410 --> 02:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
and if I say somebody's name and you're
 
02:54:11.090 --> 02:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
in the process just wave your hands so I
 
02:54:16.730 --> 02:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:19.670 --> 02:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you
 
02:54:22.910 --> 02:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
as you said my name's Ed Butler and I
 
02:54:25.730 --> 02:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
was a state rep for six terms leaving in
 
02:54:25.740 --> 02:54:27.050 align:start position:0%
was a state rep for six terms leaving in
2020.

02:54:27.050 --> 02:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
2020.
 
02:54:28.910 --> 02:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
at the end of my second term I became
 
02:54:31.309 --> 02:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
the chair of the Commerce Committee
 
02:54:32.870 --> 02:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's good to see some of the colleagues
 
02:54:34.550 --> 02:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
that I worked with and good to meet the
 
02:54:37.070 --> 02:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
others that I haven't yet met
 
02:54:39.590 --> 02:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
I'm a gay man and have worked on a
 
02:54:41.630 --> 02:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
number of lgbtq bills that have come
 
02:54:43.910 --> 02:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
before this house working to support
 
02:54:46.790 --> 02:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
those that acknowledge us as whole human
 
02:54:48.590 --> 02:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
beings deserving of equal treatment
 
02:54:50.570 --> 02:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
under the law
 
02:54:52.490 --> 02:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
and I have worked to push back on those
 
02:54:54.110 --> 02:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
bills that have come before this body
 
02:54:57.110 --> 02:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
when efforts have been made to undo the
 
02:54:59.030 --> 02:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
recognition and acceptance that we have
 
02:54:59.040 --> 02:55:00.290 align:start position:0%
recognition and acceptance that we have
achieved

02:55:00.290 --> 02:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
achieved
 
02:55:01.969 --> 02:55:01.979 align:start position:0%
I was the Prime sponsor of the
 
02:55:04.309 --> 02:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
transgender non-discrimination bill that
 
02:55:08.030 --> 02:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
passed the house in 2009. and again when
 
02:55:11.090 --> 02:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
we finally passed that bill in 2018 in
 
02:55:13.790 --> 02:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
both bodies and Governor sununu signed
 
02:55:13.800 --> 02:55:14.809 align:start position:0%
both bodies and Governor sununu signed
it

02:55:14.809 --> 02:55:14.819 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:55:17.510 --> 02:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
I was a co-sponsor of the bill to ban
 
02:55:20.210 --> 02:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy the prime sponsor
 
02:55:21.889 --> 02:55:21.899 align:start position:0%
being a Republican
 
02:55:24.410 --> 02:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
which passed and was signed by governor
 
02:55:24.420 --> 02:55:26.510 align:start position:0%
which passed and was signed by governor
sununo

02:55:26.510 --> 02:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
sununo
 
02:55:28.309 --> 02:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
we are all aware that we understand
 
02:55:30.530 --> 02:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
issues through the lenses with which we
 
02:55:32.990 --> 02:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
learn about and explore our world
 
02:55:35.750 --> 02:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
the authors of this bill note all sorts
 
02:55:37.370 --> 02:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
of frightening and disastrous
 
02:55:39.889 --> 02:55:39.899 align:start position:0%
consequences of the treatment of gender
 
02:55:42.110 --> 02:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
dysphoria in children by Health Care
 
02:55:42.120 --> 02:55:43.550 align:start position:0%
dysphoria in children by Health Care
Professionals

02:55:43.550 --> 02:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
Professionals
 
02:55:45.710 --> 02:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
they are bent on proving that such
 
02:55:47.030 --> 02:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
treatments will have horrible
 
02:55:49.190 --> 02:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
consequences and the language of the
 
02:55:52.429 --> 02:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
bill certainly screams that perspective
 
02:55:54.590 --> 02:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
but if you look at this issue Through My
 
02:55:57.170 --> 02:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
Lens I too can come up with expert
 
02:55:59.389 --> 02:55:59.399 align:start position:0%
reports that report the exact opposite
 
02:56:01.370 --> 02:56:01.380 align:start position:0%
of what the bill asserts
 
02:56:03.530 --> 02:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
as reported in the Washington Post in
 
02:56:05.510 --> 02:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
February of 2022
 
02:56:08.090 --> 02:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
the Gallup poll found that 0.6 percent
 
02:56:10.490 --> 02:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
of U.S adults identify as transgender
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
but among gen Z adults about 2 percent
 
02:56:16.670 --> 02:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
identify as transgender and researchers
 
02:56:19.070 --> 02:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
expect that number to grow
 
02:56:20.809 --> 02:56:20.819 align:start position:0%
does this mean that there are more
 
02:56:22.790 --> 02:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
transgender people than before
 
02:56:25.130 --> 02:56:25.140 align:start position:0%
Advocates say that it's merely a sign
 
02:56:27.050 --> 02:56:27.060 align:start position:0%
that more transgender people have the
 
02:56:29.870 --> 02:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
information and language available to
 
02:56:32.630 --> 02:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
understand and describe their identities
 
02:56:34.309 --> 02:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
transgender people have existed
 
02:56:36.349 --> 02:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
throughout history including transgender
 
02:56:36.359 --> 02:56:37.429 align:start position:0%
throughout history including transgender
children

02:56:37.429 --> 02:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:56:39.490 --> 02:56:39.500 align:start position:0%
but many clinics
 
02:56:41.870 --> 02:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me many clinics have been
 
02:56:43.849 --> 02:56:43.859 align:start position:0%
treating transgender children only in
 
02:56:45.349 --> 02:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
recent decades
 
02:56:47.389 --> 02:56:47.399 align:start position:0%
the medical director of the center for
 
02:56:49.190 --> 02:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
Trans youth health and development in
 
02:56:51.830 --> 02:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
Children's Hospital Los Angeles one of
 
02:56:53.690 --> 02:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
the largest transgender clinics in the
 
02:56:55.790 --> 02:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
country said her Clinic has been taking
 
02:56:58.309 --> 02:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
care of trans young people only since
 
02:57:00.590 --> 02:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
the 1990s
 
02:57:02.870 --> 02:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
what's happening now is not a massive
 
02:57:05.210 --> 02:57:05.220 align:start position:0%
surge in transgender people
 
02:57:07.730 --> 02:57:07.740 align:start position:0%
it's an understanding that gender much
 
02:57:10.790 --> 02:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
like sexuality exists on a spectrum and
 
02:57:14.330 --> 02:57:14.340 align:start position:0%
is more fluid Than People allow
 
02:57:16.670 --> 02:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
but the authors of this bill want to
 
02:57:17.990 --> 02:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
make it impossible for children
 
02:57:19.730 --> 02:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
experiencing questions about their
 
02:57:22.670 --> 02:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
agenda to express those feelings to some
 
02:57:24.349 --> 02:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
of the most important authority figures
 
02:57:27.290 --> 02:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
in their young lives 15 seconds if you
 
02:57:28.370 --> 02:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
could wrap it up for us
 
02:57:30.290 --> 02:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
and if those feelings are expressed the
 
02:57:34.030 --> 02:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
bill sponsors withhold supportive care
 
02:57:38.150 --> 02:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
135-g colon 2 is headed prohibition of
 
02:57:40.190 --> 02:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
gender transition care for children and
 
02:57:41.690 --> 02:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
young adults
 
02:57:43.670 --> 02:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
I urge you to see this bill for what it
 
02:57:46.190 --> 02:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
is a fearful response to a new and
 
02:57:48.650 --> 02:57:48.660 align:start position:0%
challenging understanding of who we are
 
02:57:51.290 --> 02:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
as fully expressive human beings
 
02:57:53.210 --> 02:57:53.220 align:start position:0%
when representative Cannon and I first
 
02:57:55.130 --> 02:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
introduced the trans non-discrimination
 
02:57:57.590 --> 02:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
Bill we held a variety of gatherings to
 
02:57:59.870 --> 02:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
help lawmakers understand what it is to
 
02:58:01.429 --> 02:58:01.439 align:start position:0%
be transgender
 
02:58:04.010 --> 02:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
in 2018 we made that Journey throughout
 
02:58:05.809 --> 02:58:05.819 align:start position:0%
our state and the support for the
 
02:58:07.750 --> 02:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
transgender Community was ultimately
 
02:58:10.610 --> 02:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
Broad and bipartisan could you please
 
02:58:12.950 --> 02:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
wrap up please don't believe all that's
 
02:58:14.870 --> 02:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
written in this bill broaden your lens
 
02:58:17.030 --> 02:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
learn its important treatment when
 
02:58:19.550 --> 02:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
warranted can help a transgender child
 
02:58:22.150 --> 02:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
grow into a strong and happy adult
 
02:58:25.910 --> 02:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
please make HB 619 expedient to
 
02:58:25.920 --> 02:58:27.230 align:start position:0%
please make HB 619 expedient to
legislative

02:58:30.530 --> 02:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:58:33.110 --> 02:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
um thank you next we will have Elaine
 
02:58:35.690 --> 02:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
plant up with Cameron munz after that
 
02:58:37.309 --> 02:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
um just so you know we're coming up to
 
02:58:38.870 --> 02:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
one o'clock which is when we were
 
02:58:41.090 --> 02:58:41.100 align:start position:0%
scheduled to begin our next bill we had
 
02:58:44.630 --> 02:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
this many paint cards left so we want to
 
02:58:46.610 --> 02:58:46.620 align:start position:0%
hear everybody and what you have to say
 
02:58:48.290 --> 02:58:48.300 align:start position:0%
but if your statements have already been
 
02:58:51.170 --> 02:58:51.180 align:start position:0%
made if you can let us know what what
 
02:58:53.030 --> 02:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
statement it is that you believe in and
 
02:58:54.469 --> 02:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
if you want to go along with that
 
02:58:56.090 --> 02:58:56.100 align:start position:0%
support so that we can also have time
 
02:58:57.650 --> 02:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
for the other Bill that'd be much
 
02:58:59.090 --> 02:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
appreciated but we're not trying to
 
02:59:03.590 --> 02:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:05.929 --> 02:59:05.939 align:start position:0%
I think I'll do a Last Call on the lane
 
02:59:09.410 --> 02:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:12.769 --> 02:59:12.779 align:start position:0%
do we have Stephanie Cauley in the room
 
02:59:14.750 --> 02:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
fantastic and then on Deck we'll have
 
02:59:22.310 --> 02:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:22.320 --> 02:59:23.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:59:23.870 --> 02:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:59:26.570 --> 02:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
um hi thank you I'll try to be brief
 
02:59:28.550 --> 02:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
because everybody's hungry and I don't
 
02:59:29.990 --> 02:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
know about anybody else but I gotta use
 
02:59:33.290 --> 02:59:33.300 align:start position:0%
the bathroom very soon so I'm 67 years
 
02:59:36.830 --> 02:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
old I live in Santa Conway it's been my
 
02:59:38.690 --> 02:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
representative I haven't been here since
 
02:59:42.410 --> 02:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
2018 when I testified at the original
 
02:59:44.570 --> 02:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
trans Rights bill so it's been a few
 
02:59:47.450 --> 02:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
years but I am here in opposition to
 
02:59:51.170 --> 02:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
this bill I strongly oppose it I grew up
 
02:59:53.330 --> 02:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
at a time much like Jerry
 
02:59:57.710 --> 02:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
um when being trans was hidden away and
 
03:00:00.830 --> 03:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
we had to make you the best we could
 
03:00:04.910 --> 03:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
um and this bill attempts to push trans
 
03:00:08.870 --> 03:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
kids back into the closet so I adamantly
 
03:00:13.250 --> 03:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
oppose it I went through so much pain
 
03:00:13.260 --> 03:00:14.030 align:start position:0%
oppose it I went through so much pain
um

03:00:14.030 --> 03:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:17.809 --> 03:00:17.819 align:start position:0%
awful experiences trying to live a life
 
03:00:19.670 --> 03:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
as a transgender woman when I was
 
03:00:19.680 --> 03:00:21.130 align:start position:0%
as a transgender woman when I was
younger

03:00:21.130 --> 03:00:21.140 align:start position:0%
younger
 
03:00:24.769 --> 03:00:24.779 align:start position:0%
and a lot of self-harm
 
03:00:27.889 --> 03:00:27.899 align:start position:0%
that occurred as a result of that I've
 
03:00:31.070 --> 03:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
seen progress in our society but I see
 
03:00:33.650 --> 03:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
this awful pushback coming trying to
 
03:00:35.330 --> 03:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
push us back into the closet and
 
03:00:37.490 --> 03:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
exterminate us essentially
 
03:00:40.550 --> 03:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
so I again I oppose I don't want to get
 
03:00:43.130 --> 03:00:43.140 align:start position:0%
too lengthy because everybody's tired I
 
03:00:45.110 --> 03:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
just would say that this seems to be an
 
03:00:47.870 --> 03:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
unwarranted intrusion into the private
 
03:00:50.990 --> 03:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
decision-making of patients families in
 
03:00:53.750 --> 03:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
the medical doctors gender affirming
 
03:00:57.650 --> 03:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
care is supported by all the major
 
03:01:00.590 --> 03:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
medical groups iron retired nurse I'm
 
03:01:04.330 --> 03:01:04.340 align:start position:0%
very well aware of standards of care
 
03:01:06.889 --> 03:01:06.899 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices and gender
 
03:01:09.650 --> 03:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
farming care meets those and gender from
 
03:01:12.530 --> 03:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
kid is literally life-saving I am open
 
03:01:15.650 --> 03:01:15.660 align:start position:0%

03:01:17.330 --> 03:01:17.340 align:start position:0%

03:01:29.389 --> 03:01:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:31.370 --> 03:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you three minutes

members thank you for putting up with a
 
03:01:37.670 --> 03:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
very long day um and being here to hear
 
03:01:39.410 --> 03:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
important testimony about this
 
03:01:41.630 --> 03:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
legislation my name is Chris sergell I'm
 
03:01:44.150 --> 03:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
an attorney with glbtq legal Advocates
 
03:01:47.690 --> 03:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
and Defenders better known as glad and I
 
03:01:50.389 --> 03:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
am going to focus in on just a couple of
 
03:01:51.889 --> 03:01:51.899 align:start position:0%
issues that people haven't really
 
03:01:55.250 --> 03:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
covered in much depth number one I want
 
03:01:57.830 --> 03:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
to talk about the constitutional rights
 
03:02:01.309 --> 03:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
that are impacted by denying a parent
 
03:02:03.889 --> 03:02:03.899 align:start position:0%
and a child the right to obtain Medical
 
03:02:07.130 --> 03:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
Care medical care that is
 
03:02:09.769 --> 03:02:09.779 align:start position:0%
um widely accepted by every single Major
 
03:02:12.650 --> 03:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
Medical Association in the country and
 
03:02:15.710 --> 03:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
medical care that is governed by widely
 
03:02:18.710 --> 03:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
accepted standards of care when you deny
 
03:02:21.290 --> 03:02:21.300 align:start position:0%
a parent the right to obtain medical
 
03:02:23.750 --> 03:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
care for their child you are infringing
 
03:02:26.750 --> 03:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
upon that parent's fundamental right to
 
03:02:28.429 --> 03:02:28.439 align:start position:0%
direct the upbringing of their children
 
03:02:30.530 --> 03:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
that fundamental right has been
 
03:02:32.750 --> 03:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
recognized by a the Supreme Court of the
 
03:02:34.250 --> 03:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
United States and by the New Hampshire
 
03:02:36.530 --> 03:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court repeatedly there is
 
03:02:39.110 --> 03:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
nothing more fundamental to the
 
03:02:40.910 --> 03:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
upbringing of your child than making
 
03:02:42.710 --> 03:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
Medical Care decisions
 
03:02:45.490 --> 03:02:45.500 align:start position:0%
um that impact that child's health
 
03:02:48.250 --> 03:02:48.260 align:start position:0%
and also the there's another
 
03:02:51.170 --> 03:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
constitutional Dimension to a ban on
 
03:02:52.969 --> 03:02:52.979 align:start position:0%
gender affirming Medical Care and that
 
03:02:56.630 --> 03:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
is the um the constitutional right to be
 
03:02:58.309 --> 03:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
treated as equals under the law
 
03:03:00.590 --> 03:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
transgender people share that right just
 
03:03:02.330 --> 03:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
like everyone else does this bill
 
03:03:05.210 --> 03:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
singles out transgender people and
 
03:03:07.730 --> 03:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
prohibits them from obtaining Medical
 
03:03:10.010 --> 03:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
Care in a way that is uh that is
 
03:03:12.349 --> 03:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
flagrantly in violation of the principle
 
03:03:13.849 --> 03:03:13.859 align:start position:0%
of equal protection under the law
 
03:03:17.150 --> 03:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
finally I just want to focus in for a
 
03:03:20.389 --> 03:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
moment on the repeal of the ban on
 
03:03:22.929 --> 03:03:22.939 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy which is in this bill
 
03:03:26.090 --> 03:03:26.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would be the first state
 
03:03:28.990 --> 03:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
to repeal a ban on conversion therapy
 
03:03:31.550 --> 03:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
and I just think that's really important
 
03:03:33.469 --> 03:03:33.479 align:start position:0%
to note that no other state has taken
 
03:03:36.050 --> 03:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
such a drastic step I'd also like to
 
03:03:39.889 --> 03:03:39.899 align:start position:0%
note that the um exception in there for
 
03:03:42.950 --> 03:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
young people who affirmatively provide
 
03:03:45.110 --> 03:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
notice that they don't consent to
 
03:03:47.510 --> 03:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy that is an unmutable
 
03:03:50.630 --> 03:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
standard there are zero cases of a
 
03:03:53.450 --> 03:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
adolescent teenager being able to say oh
 
03:03:55.969 --> 03:03:55.979 align:start position:0%
I provided a memo to my doctor in
 
03:03:57.469 --> 03:03:57.479 align:start position:0%
advance that said I didn't want to get
 
03:03:59.990 --> 03:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
this treatment and therefore I can prove
 
03:04:02.269 --> 03:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
that uh you know it was it was done
 
03:04:04.130 --> 03:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
against my will so I just want to be
 
03:04:06.710 --> 03:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
very clear that this is a full repeal on
 
03:04:09.170 --> 03:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
the ban of conversion therapy there's no
 
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
person who could ever meet the standard
 
03:04:12.410 --> 03:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
to show that their rights are violated
 
03:04:14.330 --> 03:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
under the law that's all I wanted to
 
03:04:16.309 --> 03:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
touch on but I'm happy to take questions
 
03:04:18.769 --> 03:04:18.779 align:start position:0%
on any topic thank you any questions
 
03:04:20.150 --> 03:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
03:04:22.670 --> 03:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much Luke

03:04:29.870 --> 03:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
how's it going I came here today not to
 
03:04:31.790 --> 03:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
share any opinions I came here to share
 
03:04:35.210 --> 03:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
facts because upon reading hb619 I found
 
03:04:37.130 --> 03:04:37.140 align:start position:0%
that there were exactly zero facts to
 
03:04:38.450 --> 03:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
support any of the claims that were made
 
03:04:40.690 --> 03:04:40.700 align:start position:0%
in the bill other than the statistics of
 
03:04:43.969 --> 03:04:43.979 align:start position:0%

found only 15.9 percent of those who

de-transitioned did So based on a factor
 
03:06:09.830 --> 03:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
of identity
 
03:06:11.330 --> 03:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
there are other factors such as
 
03:06:14.210 --> 03:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
financial and such as hate
 
03:06:16.610 --> 03:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
that pulled much higher

somewhere in the bill I forget exactly
 
03:06:20.090 --> 03:06:20.100 align:start position:0%

longitudinal study on puberty blockers
 
03:06:24.889 --> 03:06:24.899 align:start position:0%
and I provided one titled young adult

03:07:03.170 --> 03:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
outcomes on the topic of mental health I
 
03:07:05.809 --> 03:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
reviewed about 56 studies 52 of which
 
03:07:08.030 --> 03:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
indicated that transitioning has a
 
03:07:10.190 --> 03:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
positive effect on mental health of
 
03:07:12.050 --> 03:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
transgender people four of which
 
03:07:14.929 --> 03:07:14.939 align:start position:0%
indicated mixed or null results meaning
 
03:07:17.030 --> 03:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
that exactly zero indicated negative
 
03:07:17.040 --> 03:07:18.950 align:start position:0%
that exactly zero indicated negative
results

03:07:18.950 --> 03:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
results
 
03:07:20.809 --> 03:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
furthermore there was a study on mental
 
03:07:22.610 --> 03:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
health self-worth and socially
 
03:07:25.490 --> 03:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
transition and transgender youth the
 
03:07:26.929 --> 03:07:26.939 align:start position:0%
conclusion of which
 
03:07:29.210 --> 03:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
essentially is that socially children
 
03:07:31.130 --> 03:07:31.140 align:start position:0%
who socially transition report levels of
 
03:07:32.830 --> 03:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
depression anxiety that closely match
 
03:07:35.389 --> 03:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
levels reported by their cisgender
 
03:07:39.290 --> 03:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
children or colleagues meaning that from
 
03:07:41.630 --> 03:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
a demographic of one of the highest
 
03:07:45.170 --> 03:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideation and suicide Tendencies
 
03:07:46.849 --> 03:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
they go back down to essentially normal

03:07:52.610 --> 03:07:52.620 align:start position:0%

hi good afternoon thanks for having us

and thanks to all the committee members
 
03:08:11.809 --> 03:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
for listening to this testimony today
 
03:08:14.090 --> 03:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
those stories that we've heard have been
 
03:08:16.670 --> 03:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
incredibly powerful my name is Timothy
 
03:08:18.650 --> 03:08:18.660 align:start position:0%

Lyme New Hampshire
 
03:08:23.750 --> 03:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to read the testimony that
 
03:08:25.790 --> 03:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
I've submitted that online already for
 
03:08:27.889 --> 03:08:27.899 align:start position:0%
you there's one aspect I do want to
 
03:08:29.510 --> 03:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
point out that has not been discussed
 
03:08:31.969 --> 03:08:31.979 align:start position:0%
much today is that in addition to the
 
03:08:33.530 --> 03:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
dangers that this poses to the trans
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
Community this also imposes dangerous
 
03:08:38.389 --> 03:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
directly to the medical community this
 
03:08:41.450 --> 03:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
puts Physicians nurse practitioners and
 
03:08:43.010 --> 03:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
other clinicians
 
03:08:45.349 --> 03:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
in an untenable situation in which we're
 
03:08:48.429 --> 03:08:48.439 align:start position:0%
asked not to practice good Medical Care
 
03:08:50.929 --> 03:08:50.939 align:start position:0%
perhaps even to practice negligent Care
 
03:08:52.730 --> 03:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
by harming patients
 
03:08:55.190 --> 03:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
or risk having a medical license taken
 
03:08:56.450 --> 03:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
away from us
 
03:08:59.210 --> 03:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
at a time when Physicians and nurse
 
03:09:00.950 --> 03:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
practitioners and others are already
 
03:09:03.590 --> 03:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
facing an incredible stress load in
 
03:09:05.030 --> 03:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
their work life
 
03:09:07.490 --> 03:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
High suicide rates in the clinician
 
03:09:09.950 --> 03:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
community and difficulties recruiting
 
03:09:09.960 --> 03:09:11.630 align:start position:0%
community and difficulties recruiting
providers

03:09:11.630 --> 03:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
providers
 
03:09:13.610 --> 03:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
particularly in primary care to come
 
03:09:16.429 --> 03:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
work in New Hampshire at times when it's
 
03:09:19.490 --> 03:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
impossible in many communities to find a
 
03:09:22.670 --> 03:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
provider to be your PCP a bill such as
 
03:09:24.650 --> 03:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
this is going to make it much much more
 
03:09:26.710 --> 03:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
difficult to retain and recruit
 
03:09:28.790 --> 03:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
clinicians to come work in the state of
 
03:09:30.230 --> 03:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and that's going to have
 
03:09:32.150 --> 03:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
an incredible detrimental effect on
 
03:09:34.370 --> 03:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:09:36.110 --> 03:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
so I'll stop there if there's any
 
03:09:36.120 --> 03:09:43.550 align:start position:0%
so I'll stop there if there's any
questions

03:09:43.550 --> 03:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:45.650 --> 03:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
we have Jonas Sutton Morse followed by a
 
03:09:48.710 --> 03:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza
 
03:09:51.769 --> 03:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you my name is John
 
03:09:54.230 --> 03:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
Sutton Morse I'm from Canterbury
 
03:09:56.030 --> 03:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify against the bill
 
03:09:58.370 --> 03:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
because to put it bluntly this would
 
03:10:00.410 --> 03:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
directly impair my ability as a parent
 
03:10:02.870 --> 03:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
and person of Faith to instruct my
 
03:10:04.670 --> 03:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
children which is the very thing that
 
03:10:07.490 --> 03:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
the bill claims to support
 
03:10:09.590 --> 03:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of the Concord monthly
 
03:10:11.210 --> 03:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
meeting and New England yearly meeting
 
03:10:13.190 --> 03:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
of the religious Society of Friends the
 
03:10:13.200 --> 03:10:14.750 align:start position:0%
of the religious Society of Friends the
Quakers

03:10:14.750 --> 03:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
Quakers
 
03:10:16.910 --> 03:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
a parent of three children my oldest let
 
03:10:18.349 --> 03:10:18.359 align:start position:0%
us know last year that they are
 
03:10:18.359 --> 03:10:19.670 align:start position:0%
us know last year that they are
non-binary

03:10:19.670 --> 03:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
non-binary
 
03:10:21.769 --> 03:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
my kid's really great play Minecraft
 
03:10:24.170 --> 03:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
they like rock climbing which is nice
 
03:10:25.910 --> 03:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
because now they wear safety gear when
 
03:10:27.730 --> 03:10:27.740 align:start position:0%
they go up high
 
03:10:31.610 --> 03:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
my middle child is nine she is very
 
03:10:34.250 --> 03:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
respectful of her older siblings
 
03:10:37.250 --> 03:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
pronouns it's really great
 
03:10:39.290 --> 03:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
when your nine-year-old comes in and
 
03:10:43.010 --> 03:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
they're so mad at their older sibling
 
03:10:45.530 --> 03:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
and they pause to get the pronouns right
 
03:10:45.540 --> 03:10:46.910 align:start position:0%
and they pause to get the pronouns right
Daddy

03:10:46.910 --> 03:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
Daddy
 
03:10:50.769 --> 03:10:50.779 align:start position:0%
they were so mean and unfair
 
03:10:54.110 --> 03:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
I'm the parent of some kids who are
 
03:10:56.990 --> 03:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
great and awesome and this bill notes
 
03:10:59.389 --> 03:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
that Many religious faiths teach the
 
03:11:02.330 --> 03:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
therapist but two genders as best I can
 
03:11:04.429 --> 03:11:04.439 align:start position:0%
tell New England yearly meeting hasn't
 
03:11:06.650 --> 03:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
minted a position on this
 
03:11:08.929 --> 03:11:08.939 align:start position:0%
but I do have a few centuries of Quaker
 
03:11:11.450 --> 03:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
testimony on integrity and my kid let us
 
03:11:14.030 --> 03:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
know that they were non-binary we
 
03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
updated their records with a doctor and
 
03:11:18.230 --> 03:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
the dentist and when my employer came
 
03:11:20.809 --> 03:11:20.819 align:start position:0%
out for health insurance and asked me to
 
03:11:23.929 --> 03:11:23.939 align:start position:0%
list all of my family members
 
03:11:26.809 --> 03:11:26.819 align:start position:0%
I wrote to my HR department and I said I
 
03:11:28.610 --> 03:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
need you to update things so that I'm
 
03:11:30.530 --> 03:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
not writing male or female because those
 
03:11:31.969 --> 03:11:31.979 align:start position:0%
aren't correct
 
03:11:34.490 --> 03:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
shout out to my HR department in I.T for
 
03:11:36.490 --> 03:11:36.500 align:start position:0%
getting it right
 
03:11:38.990 --> 03:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's my testimony to this
 
03:11:40.670 --> 03:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
committee and that's my testimony as a
 
03:11:42.889 --> 03:11:42.899 align:start position:0%
person of Faith to the world this bill
 
03:11:44.690 --> 03:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
says that parents are solely responsible
 
03:11:46.010 --> 03:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
for teaching their children about
 
03:11:47.929 --> 03:11:47.939 align:start position:0%
matters of Faith morals and matters
 
03:11:50.570 --> 03:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
relating to their sexuality we told our
 
03:11:53.090 --> 03:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
kids be straightforward and clear when
 
03:11:55.130 --> 03:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
you have a conversation are they a boy
 
03:11:58.010 --> 03:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
or a girl no they're not well should we
 
03:12:00.290 --> 03:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
say he or she about them no you should
 
03:12:01.429 --> 03:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
say that
 
03:12:03.530 --> 03:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
and we told our kids if people get
 
03:12:05.990 --> 03:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
argumentative and confrontational go
 
03:12:07.670 --> 03:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
find an adult and have them help
 
03:12:09.889 --> 03:12:09.899 align:start position:0%
navigate the situation
 
03:12:12.769 --> 03:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
this bill says that teachers can't help
 
03:12:13.849 --> 03:12:13.859 align:start position:0%
do that
 
03:12:18.170 --> 03:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't do what it says about
 
03:12:21.110 --> 03:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
letting me instruct my kids on manners
 
03:12:23.150 --> 03:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
of faith and morality
 
03:12:26.510 --> 03:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
and you should vote against it
 
03:12:28.670 --> 03:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
03:12:31.250 --> 03:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
the committee saying none thank you we
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
have representative Potenza followed by
 
03:12:42.070 --> 03:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:44.150 --> 03:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you chair my name is
 
03:12:46.190 --> 03:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly Potenza I represent
 
03:12:49.790 --> 03:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
Stratford District 19. I am strong
 
03:12:52.190 --> 03:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
support of this bill
 
03:12:56.150 --> 03:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
um based upon the science is unsettled
 
03:12:57.610 --> 03:12:57.620 align:start position:0%
on this
 
03:13:01.269 --> 03:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
so Dr William Malona he's an Idaho based
 
03:13:04.190 --> 03:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
assistant clinical professor of
 
03:13:06.170 --> 03:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
endocrinology and there's a lot of
 
03:13:07.730 --> 03:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
medical stuff that's in here and there's
 
03:13:09.290 --> 03:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that people have talked
 
03:13:11.269 --> 03:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
about already but he's a member of a
 
03:13:13.130 --> 03:13:13.140 align:start position:0%
society for evidence-based general
 
03:13:15.410 --> 03:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
medicine he's been in this field for a
 
03:13:17.630 --> 03:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
long time and it's actually an
 
03:13:19.130 --> 03:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
international group of more than a
 
03:13:21.070 --> 03:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
hundred clinicians and researchers
 
03:13:23.809 --> 03:13:23.819 align:start position:0%
concerned about what they call the lack
 
03:13:26.210 --> 03:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
of quality evidence for the use of
 
03:13:29.030 --> 03:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
hormonal and surgical interventions as
 
03:13:30.769 --> 03:13:30.779 align:start position:0%
first line of treatment for young people
 
03:13:33.410 --> 03:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
with gender dysphoria
 
03:13:35.570 --> 03:13:35.580 align:start position:0%
let me be clear
 
03:13:40.150 --> 03:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
I want everyone to get whatever kind of
 
03:13:43.790 --> 03:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
mental or health or support that they
 
03:13:45.710 --> 03:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
need and if they get that if they're
 
03:13:47.870 --> 03:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
hearing it from their school or anything
 
03:13:51.830 --> 03:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
else that's not what this bill is
 
03:13:53.630 --> 03:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
designed to do it's stopping in a sense
 
03:13:56.269 --> 03:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
medical things that are not it's not
 
03:14:00.710 --> 03:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
concrete there's sides on both of this
 
03:14:03.290 --> 03:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
actually in February the Swedish board
 
03:14:07.250 --> 03:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
this was in 20 2022 the Swedish board
 
03:14:08.870 --> 03:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
um a national Board of Health and
 
03:14:11.210 --> 03:14:11.220 align:start position:0%
Welfare updated its healthcare service
 
03:14:13.610 --> 03:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
guidelines to recommend restraint when
 
03:14:15.650 --> 03:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
it comes to hormone treatment noting
 
03:14:18.650 --> 03:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
increasing reports of detransition and
 
03:14:21.170 --> 03:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
transition related regret among youth
 
03:14:24.050 --> 03:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
who transitioned in recent years the
 
03:14:26.990 --> 03:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
National Academy of Medicine in France
 
03:14:30.230 --> 03:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
also advised caution that same month in
 
03:14:32.510 --> 03:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
2020 The Finnish health authority
 
03:14:35.510 --> 03:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
issued similar guidelines deviating from
 
03:14:38.450 --> 03:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
it and recommending Psychotherapy as the
 
03:14:39.830 --> 03:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
first line of treatment for gender
 
03:14:42.349 --> 03:14:42.359 align:start position:0%
dysphoric minors
 
03:14:42.359 --> 03:14:43.490 align:start position:0%
dysphoric minors
um

03:14:43.490 --> 03:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:45.530 --> 03:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
the last thing I don't want to say is
 
03:14:47.870 --> 03:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
there's a woman that I followed for
 
03:14:49.610 --> 03:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
several years her name is Dr Miriam
 
03:14:52.010 --> 03:14:52.020 align:start position:0%
Grossman she is a child in adolescent
 
03:14:54.349 --> 03:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist she's treated young people
 
03:14:57.190 --> 03:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
for nearly 40 years and written
 
03:15:00.889 --> 03:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
extensively about gender ideology
 
03:15:03.170 --> 03:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
um and she is in full agreement of this
 
03:15:05.690 --> 03:15:05.700 align:start position:0%
that the first line of defense is
 
03:15:07.790 --> 03:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
psychotherapy I think we need to support
 
03:15:09.950 --> 03:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
this bill I think that we need to
 
03:15:12.650 --> 03:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
support our youth that are suffering
 
03:15:15.830 --> 03:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
from any anything that they have whether
 
03:15:15.840 --> 03:15:16.849 align:start position:0%
from any anything that they have whether
it's

03:15:16.849 --> 03:15:16.859 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:15:16.859 --> 03:15:17.510 align:start position:0%
it's
um

03:15:17.510 --> 03:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:21.110 --> 03:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
not just this so there's this bill is
 
03:15:23.450 --> 03:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do because we don't
 
03:15:26.090 --> 03:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
we don't know and the science is not
 
03:15:28.910 --> 03:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
concrete on this and thank you for your
 
03:15:30.710 --> 03:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much any questions
 
03:15:32.690 --> 03:15:32.700 align:start position:0%
from the committee uh representative
 
03:15:32.700 --> 03:15:34.429 align:start position:0%
from the committee uh representative
McLean

03:15:34.429 --> 03:15:34.439 align:start position:0%
McLean
 
03:15:36.110 --> 03:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:15:38.690 --> 03:15:38.700 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um you
 
03:15:41.090 --> 03:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned in Sweden Finland and France
 
03:15:44.889 --> 03:15:44.899 align:start position:0%
uh the pivot towards Psychotherapy and
 
03:15:48.469 --> 03:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
advocating restraint so do they have any
 
03:15:48.479 --> 03:15:49.570 align:start position:0%
advocating restraint so do they have any
data

03:15:49.570 --> 03:15:49.580 align:start position:0%
data
 
03:15:52.370 --> 03:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
relatively speaking as to successful
 
03:15:55.910 --> 03:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
outcomes in comparison to the gender
 
03:15:57.830 --> 03:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
affirming therapy therapy that we've
 
03:15:59.510 --> 03:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
heard testimony today
 
03:15:59.520 --> 03:16:00.889 align:start position:0%
heard testimony today
just

03:16:00.889 --> 03:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:16:03.290 --> 03:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure but I will I will
 
03:16:05.210 --> 03:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
definitely do that research and I will
 
03:16:07.070 --> 03:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
send you what I will send you everything
 
03:16:09.590 --> 03:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
that I have uh read and researched on
 
03:16:11.389 --> 03:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
that to see if there is
 
03:16:14.030 --> 03:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
um that kind of research that can
 
03:16:16.309 --> 03:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
on the Psychotherapy side they feel as
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
if that is the first line of defense
 
03:16:20.510 --> 03:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
that there's not enough science on the
 
03:16:22.250 --> 03:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
other side in using medical
 
03:16:24.410 --> 03:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
interventions in regards with Therapies
 
03:16:26.990 --> 03:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
in in hormone treatments they don't know
 
03:16:28.969 --> 03:16:28.979 align:start position:0%
the long-term effects of those that's
 
03:16:30.650 --> 03:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
the reason why that their their first
 
03:16:34.490 --> 03:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
yes it would just be interesting to be
 
03:16:38.450 --> 03:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
able to look at some quantitative data
 
03:16:40.670 --> 03:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
and if they had done uh work in those
 
03:16:42.710 --> 03:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
countries it'd be interesting to see
 
03:16:44.210 --> 03:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:16:46.429 --> 03:16:46.439 align:start position:0%

03:17:03.769 --> 03:17:03.779 align:start position:0%

that portrait is of my transgender
 
03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
daughter Emilia taken in the fall of
 
03:17:19.920 --> 03:17:21.650 align:start position:0%
daughter Emilia taken in the fall of
2017.

03:17:21.650 --> 03:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
2017.
 
03:17:24.230 --> 03:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
earlier that year unbeknownst to us she
 
03:17:26.809 --> 03:17:26.819 align:start position:0%
experienced excruciating gender
 
03:17:26.819 --> 03:17:28.309 align:start position:0%
experienced excruciating gender
dysphoria

03:17:28.309 --> 03:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
dysphoria
 
03:17:30.349 --> 03:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
it took her a while to understand and
 
03:17:33.170 --> 03:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
then admit to herself what was going on
 
03:17:35.690 --> 03:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
but in the fall of her senior year
 
03:17:38.210 --> 03:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
about when that photo was taken
 
03:17:40.130 --> 03:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
she came out to her friends and family
 
03:17:43.070 --> 03:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
as a transgender girl my child was an
 
03:17:45.769 --> 03:17:45.779 align:start position:0%
exceptional young person awarded a
 
03:17:48.170 --> 03:17:48.180 align:start position:0%
scholarship to her prestigious boarding
 
03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
school in Connecticut where she was
 
03:17:52.389 --> 03:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
voted class president four years running
 
03:17:56.150 --> 03:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
a high honors student a crew team member
 
03:17:59.050 --> 03:17:59.060 align:start position:0%
a National Honor Society musician
 
03:18:02.510 --> 03:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
courted by all the best colleges and was
 
03:18:04.969 --> 03:18:04.979 align:start position:0%
deeply loved and respected by her peers
 
03:18:06.889 --> 03:18:06.899 align:start position:0%
and teachers
 
03:18:09.050 --> 03:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
she had a hard time putting together the
 
03:18:11.870 --> 03:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
pieces in her mind about how she could
 
03:18:13.790 --> 03:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
live her life as a girl life at a
 
03:18:16.969 --> 03:18:16.979 align:start position:0%
boarding school is incredibly binary and
 
03:18:20.269 --> 03:18:20.279 align:start position:0%
there was no support in that school and
 
03:18:22.010 --> 03:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
her body was telling her she simply
 
03:18:24.290 --> 03:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
could not go on as a boy
 
03:18:28.070 --> 03:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
so three months after she told everyone
 
03:18:31.849 --> 03:18:31.859 align:start position:0%
she was trans she died by Suicide one
 
03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
winter Saturday morning away at school
 
03:18:38.750 --> 03:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
my daughter was an exceptional young
 
03:18:41.690 --> 03:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
person but her situation unfortunately
 
03:18:44.450 --> 03:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
is not exceptional as we've heard over
 
03:18:47.570 --> 03:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
and over this morning and today
 
03:18:50.570 --> 03:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
around 45 percent of transgender young
 
03:18:53.929 --> 03:18:53.939 align:start position:0%
people attempt suicide transgender girls
 
03:18:56.450 --> 03:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
like my daughter are even at a higher
 
03:18:59.929 --> 03:18:59.939 align:start position:0%
risk than that that is almost one out of
 
03:19:02.870 --> 03:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
every two kids
 
03:19:06.070 --> 03:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
what other demographic in all of society
 
03:19:09.830 --> 03:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
is that vulnerable
 
03:19:13.550 --> 03:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
what we didn't realize in time
 
03:19:16.309 --> 03:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
in how fast everything went
 
03:19:19.010 --> 03:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
was how much at risk every transgender
 
03:19:21.710 --> 03:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
child is no matter how well-loved they
 
03:19:24.950 --> 03:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
are no matter how well supported
 
03:19:27.170 --> 03:19:27.180 align:start position:0%
this is because despite individual
 
03:19:30.469 --> 03:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
circumstances there is a pervasive
 
03:19:30.479 --> 03:19:31.790 align:start position:0%
circumstances there is a pervasive
stigma

03:19:31.790 --> 03:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
stigma
 
03:19:35.150 --> 03:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
generated by all of us corporately
 
03:19:37.969 --> 03:19:37.979 align:start position:0%
creating a backdrop to everything like a
 
03:19:41.330 --> 03:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
chronic underlying hum of hatred that
 
03:19:42.950 --> 03:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
eats away at even the most
 
03:19:45.290 --> 03:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
well-supported transgender young
 
03:19:47.750 --> 03:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
person's soul
 
03:19:50.570 --> 03:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
so when legislators come together as you
 
03:19:53.870 --> 03:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
all did five years ago to ensure a
 
03:19:57.230 --> 03:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
transgender rights it is like a gigantic
 
03:19:59.990 --> 03:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
unyielding weight is lifted from these
 
03:20:03.050 --> 03:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children's shoulders
 
03:20:06.170 --> 03:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
but when legislators turn coarse and
 
03:20:08.750 --> 03:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
together suddenly and intentionally
 
03:20:11.630 --> 03:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
Target this particularly vulnerable
 
03:20:15.290 --> 03:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
population this minority and attack the
 
03:20:17.809 --> 03:20:17.819 align:start position:0%
parental rights of trans families it
 
03:20:20.330 --> 03:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
only increases the vulnerability of
 
03:20:22.610 --> 03:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
these transgender youths and puts them
 
03:20:24.769 --> 03:20:24.779 align:start position:0%
even higher
 
03:20:28.370 --> 03:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
for harm or hate crimes and I know that
 
03:20:30.349 --> 03:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
pers that persecuting vulnerable
 
03:20:32.450 --> 03:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
minorities is not what New Hampshire is
 
03:20:32.460 --> 03:20:33.889 align:start position:0%
minorities is not what New Hampshire is
about

03:20:33.889 --> 03:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:20:35.750 --> 03:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you in my faith tradition the
 
03:20:38.210 --> 03:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
Bible asserts that God stands with
 
03:20:40.429 --> 03:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
closest to those who are marginalized in
 
03:20:43.130 --> 03:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
Earth and God suffers when they suffer
 
03:20:46.070 --> 03:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
so I invite our legislators to stand in
 
03:20:48.469 --> 03:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
that place too and work against this
 
03:20:51.950 --> 03:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
cruel backward step and protect all New
 
03:20:54.170 --> 03:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's children by defeating Bill
 
03:20:54.180 --> 03:20:55.490 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's children by defeating Bill
619

03:20:55.490 --> 03:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
619
 
03:20:57.410 --> 03:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
03:20:57.420 --> 03:20:58.429 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
questions

03:20:58.429 --> 03:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:21:00.349 --> 03:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
um seeing none thank you very much and
 
03:21:01.730 --> 03:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
we are trying to keep to that three
 
03:21:03.889 --> 03:21:03.899 align:start position:0%
minutes we still have
 
03:21:07.309 --> 03:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
a very large stack of of pink sheets and
 
03:21:08.630 --> 03:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that everybody is
 
03:21:11.150 --> 03:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
heard we have Karen De Silva followed by
 
03:21:12.889 --> 03:21:12.899 align:start position:0%
David Arthur
 
03:21:15.530 --> 03:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
hi good afternoon my name is Caitlin
 
03:21:18.230 --> 03:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
dasilva I use they them pronouns I'm a
 
03:21:20.030 --> 03:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
social worker and I'm a member of the
 
03:21:21.590 --> 03:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
Episcopal Church
 
03:21:24.110 --> 03:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
and I am speaking here before you in
 
03:21:27.889 --> 03:21:27.899 align:start position:0%
opposition of hb619
 
03:21:30.230 --> 03:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
by the time I was 12 years old I felt as
 
03:21:31.370 --> 03:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
though I was different from everyone
 
03:21:33.650 --> 03:21:33.660 align:start position:0%
else part of this was due to the
 
03:21:35.929 --> 03:21:35.939 align:start position:0%
religion that I grew up in religious
 
03:21:38.210 --> 03:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
beliefs that this bill is citing as one
 
03:21:40.010 --> 03:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why teachers should not
 
03:21:42.410 --> 03:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
be allowed to mention genders other than
 
03:21:44.990 --> 03:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
male or female or pronouns other than
 
03:21:47.090 --> 03:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
those in common use in the English
 
03:21:49.490 --> 03:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
language when referring to male or
 
03:21:49.500 --> 03:21:50.330 align:start position:0%
language when referring to male or
female

03:21:50.330 --> 03:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
female
 
03:21:52.490 --> 03:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
my family never pushed these beliefs on
 
03:21:55.030 --> 03:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
me but when growing up in the church
 
03:21:57.349 --> 03:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
these were messages that everyone was
 
03:22:00.050 --> 03:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
receiving when I was 13 I begged my
 
03:22:02.510 --> 03:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
parents to send me to a Catholic Camp I
 
03:22:04.670 --> 03:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
never told anyone why but it was because
 
03:22:07.010 --> 03:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
I was hoping that this would make me so
 
03:22:09.469 --> 03:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
I was not different from everyone else I
 
03:22:11.269 --> 03:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
had heard stories about conversion
 
03:22:12.769 --> 03:22:12.779 align:start position:0%
therapy and I wanted to send myself
 
03:22:16.370 --> 03:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:18.410 --> 03:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
I grew up with so much guilt and shame
 
03:22:20.750 --> 03:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
because of the world I lived in the
 
03:22:23.030 --> 03:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
world we all live in where legislation
 
03:22:26.809 --> 03:22:26.819 align:start position:0%
such as proposed HP 619 is perpetuating
 
03:22:28.849 --> 03:22:28.859 align:start position:0%
damaging and potentially deadly
 
03:22:30.889 --> 03:22:30.899 align:start position:0%
misconceptions about the transgender and
 
03:22:33.230 --> 03:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
non-binary community
 
03:22:36.110 --> 03:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
on March 3rd 2014 at eight years old I
 
03:22:38.389 --> 03:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
tried to end my life just as one in five
 
03:22:40.370 --> 03:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
transgender and non-binary youth tried
 
03:22:43.550 --> 03:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
to end theirs these suicide rates these
 
03:22:45.650 --> 03:22:45.660 align:start position:0%
rates of suicide are not due to other
 
03:22:47.809 --> 03:22:47.819 align:start position:0%
underlying mental health conditions as
 
03:22:50.570 --> 03:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
this legislation suggests when trans and
 
03:22:52.670 --> 03:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
non-binary youth are supported in home
 
03:22:55.130 --> 03:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
and at school rates of suicide drop
 
03:22:58.130 --> 03:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
nearly 30 and 50 percent respectively
 
03:23:00.769 --> 03:23:00.779 align:start position:0%
minority stress Theory explains that the
 
03:23:02.330 --> 03:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
everyday stressors that minorities
 
03:23:04.670 --> 03:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
including transgender and non-binary
 
03:23:07.389 --> 03:23:07.399 align:start position:0%
people face on a daily basis cause
 
03:23:09.769 --> 03:23:09.779 align:start position:0%
elevated rates of mental health
 
03:23:11.750 --> 03:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
conditions such as anxiety and
 
03:23:14.809 --> 03:23:14.819 align:start position:0%
depression not the other way around
 
03:23:17.630 --> 03:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
I conclude with asking you this will you
 
03:23:19.250 --> 03:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
allow students to be called by their
 
03:23:21.229 --> 03:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
nicknames in schools or are trans
 
03:23:22.670 --> 03:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
students the only ones that will be
 
03:23:24.170 --> 03:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
required to be called by their birth
 
03:23:26.510 --> 03:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
name Will puberty blockers still be
 
03:23:28.130 --> 03:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
allowed to be prescribed for youth who
 
03:23:29.630 --> 03:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
need to delay the process of going
 
03:23:31.370 --> 03:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
through Purity because they began going
 
03:23:33.590 --> 03:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
through it at a young age or while
 
03:23:35.690 --> 03:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers only be illegal for
 
03:23:37.550 --> 03:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
Trans students who need to delay the
 
03:23:39.469 --> 03:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
process of going through puberty because
 
03:23:42.710 --> 03:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
of gender dysphoria is my gender and are
 
03:23:44.750 --> 03:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
my pronouns and the gender and pronouns
 
03:23:46.849 --> 03:23:46.859 align:start position:0%
of approximately 300 000 trans and
 
03:23:49.130 --> 03:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
non-binary youth so difficult to accept
 
03:23:51.290 --> 03:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
that you are willing to invalidate them
 
03:23:53.809 --> 03:23:53.819 align:start position:0%
to the point of suicide and this bill is
 
03:23:53.819 --> 03:23:55.429 align:start position:0%
to the point of suicide and this bill is
invalidation

03:23:55.429 --> 03:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
invalidation
 
03:23:58.250 --> 03:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
I am lucky to have found a supportive
 
03:24:00.229 --> 03:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
Faith Community family friends and
 
03:24:02.630 --> 03:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
chosen family but a lot of others have
 
03:24:04.130 --> 03:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
not been
 
03:24:06.349 --> 03:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
and so I please ask for you to consider
 
03:24:11.330 --> 03:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
opposing hb619 thank you thank you are
 
03:24:12.710 --> 03:24:12.720 align:start position:0%

it's a emotional day
 
03:24:29.750 --> 03:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's an emotional day because
 
03:24:32.389 --> 03:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
we have to actually choose the side
 
03:24:35.090 --> 03:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping that there's a medium
 
03:24:38.330 --> 03:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
but I am a gay man
 
03:24:41.929 --> 03:24:41.939 align:start position:0%

03:24:47.750 --> 03:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify from my own personal

I identified as a trans kid
 
03:25:03.650 --> 03:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
I was
 
03:25:07.429 --> 03:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
the depressed suicidal Chinese kid I
 
03:25:12.170 --> 03:25:12.180 align:start position:0%
OD'd at 13 on pills I sliced my wrist at

03:25:20.030 --> 03:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
I sincerely believed that I was a girl
 
03:25:23.150 --> 03:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
trapped in a boy's body I was without
 
03:25:23.160 --> 03:25:25.010 align:start position:0%

03:25:25.010 --> 03:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
03:25:27.889 --> 03:25:27.899 align:start position:0%
than nobody is ever born in the wrong
 
03:25:27.899 --> 03:25:31.190 align:start position:0%

03:25:33.769 --> 03:25:33.779 align:start position:0%
my story is a bit different from trans
 
03:25:35.510 --> 03:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
youth today
 
03:25:37.130 --> 03:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
because I grew up in a time when wrong

gay men and bathrooms were prevalent
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
these beliefs were even used to keep

them out of our military
 
03:31:53.570 --> 03:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
now if you tried to exclude a gay boy
 
03:31:55.370 --> 03:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
from the boy's bathroom it would clearly
 
03:31:57.110 --> 03:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
violate his civil and constitutional
 
03:31:59.690 --> 03:31:59.700 align:start position:0%

resources on litigation trying to
 
03:32:12.710 --> 03:32:12.720 align:start position:0%

you've submitted your testimony I forgot
 
03:32:30.410 --> 03:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
to ask the previous testifiers that if
 
03:32:31.790 --> 03:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
you have a copy that wasn't otherwise
 
03:32:34.429 --> 03:32:34.439 align:start position:0%

dear members of the committee
 
03:32:52.490 --> 03:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
my name is artem code if I'm testifying
 
03:32:55.969 --> 03:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
in strong opposition to Bill hb619
 
03:32:59.090 --> 03:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
I'm representing myself I am a gay man
 
03:33:02.150 --> 03:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
and an asylum Seeker from Russia living
 
03:33:03.830 --> 03:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
in Durham
 
03:33:06.650 --> 03:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
it's been a year since I left Russia
 
03:33:08.929 --> 03:33:08.939 align:start position:0%
I escaped Russia because it started the
 
03:33:11.030 --> 03:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
war in Ukraine and it's continuously
 
03:33:13.550 --> 03:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
attacking both lgbtq plus and human
 
03:33:17.090 --> 03:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
rights when I was in sixth grade I moved
 
03:33:19.610 --> 03:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
to a new school one day in early
 
03:33:23.090 --> 03:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
November 2011 my classmates were doing a
 
03:33:25.130 --> 03:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
lip sync to some famous songs of that
 
03:33:28.130 --> 03:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
time on the next day I found out that my
 
03:33:30.769 --> 03:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
classmates have recorded me singing and
 
03:33:33.410 --> 03:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
dancing and posted a video of me on
 
03:33:35.570 --> 03:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
every post possible social media
 
03:33:35.580 --> 03:33:36.469 align:start position:0%
every post possible social media
platform

03:33:36.469 --> 03:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
platform
 
03:33:39.830 --> 03:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
later on I started receiving threats
 
03:33:43.250 --> 03:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
I was pushed up against the wall I was
 
03:33:46.250 --> 03:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
bullied harassed and speed on
 
03:33:49.610 --> 03:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
I have been called all kinds of slurs
 
03:33:52.550 --> 03:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
later in the same semester I decided to
 
03:33:54.830 --> 03:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
finally talk to my class teacher who was
 
03:33:57.590 --> 03:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
a school psychologist at the same time
 
03:34:00.050 --> 03:34:00.060 align:start position:0%
on the same day she gathered my
 
03:34:01.610 --> 03:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
classmates in the classroom and told
 
03:34:03.889 --> 03:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
them about me she disclosed my sex
 
03:34:06.650 --> 03:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
orientation which resulted in even more
 
03:34:06.660 --> 03:34:08.030 align:start position:0%
orientation which resulted in even more
harassment

03:34:08.030 --> 03:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
harassment
 
03:34:10.910 --> 03:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
it was in seventh grade
 
03:34:12.769 --> 03:34:12.779 align:start position:0%
when the Russian government passed the
 
03:34:15.469 --> 03:34:15.479 align:start position:0%
gay propaganda law among miners
 
03:34:17.690 --> 03:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
this has closed all the outlets to
 
03:34:19.550 --> 03:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
discussing sexual orientation and gender
 
03:34:22.490 --> 03:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
identity with teachers psychologists and
 
03:34:23.809 --> 03:34:23.819 align:start position:0%
even parents
 
03:34:25.969 --> 03:34:25.979 align:start position:0%
for years I have been denied access to a
 
03:34:28.729 --> 03:34:28.739 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy because I was a gay minor
 
03:34:32.510 --> 03:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
in 2017 I was diagnosed with the mixed
 
03:34:35.269 --> 03:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
anxiety depressive disorder for years I
 
03:34:39.349 --> 03:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
was taking medication only in 2020 when
 
03:34:42.349 --> 03:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
I was 19 years old I could finally enter
 
03:34:44.269 --> 03:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy and could tell my
 
03:34:46.429 --> 03:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
therapist about the experiences I have
 
03:34:49.870 --> 03:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
had I escaped Russia because of the
 
03:34:53.090 --> 03:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
anti-lgbtq plus legislature I was scared
 
03:34:54.290 --> 03:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
for my life
 
03:34:57.889 --> 03:34:57.899 align:start position:0%
and felt absolutely unprotected more and
 
03:34:59.990 --> 03:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
more anti-constitutional laws have been
 
03:35:02.389 --> 03:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
introduced in Russia so far the latest
 
03:35:04.910 --> 03:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
one being the expanded LGBT
 
03:35:07.550 --> 03:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
propaganda bill that covers any age
 
03:35:10.010 --> 03:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
group instead of only minors that was
 
03:35:12.670 --> 03:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
passed and signed into law in December
 
03:35:17.690 --> 03:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
2022 even to this day on March 7th 2023
 
03:35:20.030 --> 03:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
I'm still affected by the traumatic
 
03:35:22.550 --> 03:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
experiences I have had because of such
 
03:35:25.429 --> 03:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
legislature police do not let New
 
03:35:27.950 --> 03:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire become Russia thank you thank
 
03:35:30.769 --> 03:35:30.779 align:start position:0%
you any questions from the committee
 
03:35:32.750 --> 03:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:35:34.729 --> 03:35:34.739 align:start position:0%
thank you we have Laura al-azram
 
03:35:38.150 --> 03:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
followed by a reverend M Holland
 
03:35:39.849 --> 03:35:39.859 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for listening today
 
03:35:43.429 --> 03:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
my name is Laura I'm from Londonderry
 
03:35:45.170 --> 03:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
um first of all I just wanted to say
 
03:35:47.630 --> 03:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
that I'm in support of this bill
 
03:35:49.670 --> 03:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of other people that
 
03:35:50.990 --> 03:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
are here
 
03:35:53.690 --> 03:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
you know we're not hating transgender
 
03:35:55.849 --> 03:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
people I don't hate transgender people I
 
03:35:57.469 --> 03:35:57.479 align:start position:0%
don't wish that they didn't exist in a
 
03:35:58.670 --> 03:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
couple of the other harsh things that
 
03:36:00.110 --> 03:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
were said today
 
03:36:00.120 --> 03:36:00.830 align:start position:0%
were said today
um

03:36:00.830 --> 03:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:02.809 --> 03:36:02.819 align:start position:0%
I think everyone deserves love you're
 
03:36:05.330 --> 03:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
made with inherent dignity and people
 
03:36:07.130 --> 03:36:07.140 align:start position:0%
ought to be cared for
 
03:36:09.590 --> 03:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
um but also mentioned earlier were some
 
03:36:12.530 --> 03:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
studies that have come up in Sweden and
 
03:36:14.990 --> 03:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
those are based on long-term data and
 
03:36:16.490 --> 03:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
the reason that data is important is
 
03:36:17.929 --> 03:36:17.939 align:start position:0%
because they've been collecting it for
 
03:36:20.210 --> 03:36:20.220 align:start position:0%
decades on every single person at every
 
03:36:22.429 --> 03:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
single interaction with doctors so
 
03:36:24.530 --> 03:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
there's a treasure Trove of data there
 
03:36:26.630 --> 03:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
and what's more important than the
 
03:36:29.030 --> 03:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
specific results of the study because we
 
03:36:32.650 --> 03:36:32.660 align:start position:0%
could drown in data are the results
 
03:36:34.969 --> 03:36:34.979 align:start position:0%
pediatric gender clinics that have been
 
03:36:37.490 --> 03:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
operating for decades have been closed
 
03:36:39.889 --> 03:36:39.899 align:start position:0%
because they've looked at the data and
 
03:36:41.690 --> 03:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
decided to heed it
 
03:36:44.389 --> 03:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
France Italy Australia Finland and the
 
03:36:47.389 --> 03:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
UK the Tavistock Clinic most recently
 
03:36:49.910 --> 03:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
which was the largest pediatric gender
 
03:36:53.750 --> 03:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
clinic in the world and three gender
 
03:36:57.050 --> 03:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
clinics in Sweden have closed
 
03:36:57.060 --> 03:36:58.910 align:start position:0%
clinics in Sweden have closed
because

03:36:58.910 --> 03:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:37:01.250 --> 03:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
they have decided to refocus treatment
 
03:37:03.769 --> 03:37:03.779 align:start position:0%
for gender dysphoria on mental health
 
03:37:06.170 --> 03:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
support and exploratory psychological
 
03:37:08.809 --> 03:37:08.819 align:start position:0%
care for minors
 
03:37:12.290 --> 03:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
I am a huge parents right Advocate by
 
03:37:13.729 --> 03:37:13.739 align:start position:0%
natural law parents have the broadest
 
03:37:15.290 --> 03:37:15.300 align:start position:0%
latitude to make decisions for their
 
03:37:17.090 --> 03:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
children regardless of what state law
 
03:37:19.969 --> 03:37:19.979 align:start position:0%
says however they do not have the right
 
03:37:23.269 --> 03:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
to kill them to abuse them to deprive
 
03:37:25.550 --> 03:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
them of healthy functioning body parts
 
03:37:27.830 --> 03:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
or to consent a treatment that will
 
03:37:30.349 --> 03:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
disable normal healthy bodily processes
 
03:37:33.170 --> 03:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
and cause serious defense deficiencies
 
03:37:35.809 --> 03:37:35.819 align:start position:0%
in future bodily function
 
03:37:38.750 --> 03:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
they just don't have that right
 
03:37:40.969 --> 03:37:40.979 align:start position:0%
they also do not have the requisite free
 
03:37:43.309 --> 03:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
choice in the matter seeing as that they
 
03:37:45.590 --> 03:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
as they are under threat of self-harm or
 
03:37:49.010 --> 03:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
suicide by a beloved child
 
03:37:50.510 --> 03:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
certainly minors don't have the
 
03:37:52.849 --> 03:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
cognitive capacity to make life-altering
 
03:37:52.859 --> 03:37:54.110 align:start position:0%
cognitive capacity to make life-altering
decisions

03:37:54.110 --> 03:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
03:37:56.330 --> 03:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
I don't hate people kids who want to get
 
03:37:58.910 --> 03:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
tattoos or kids who want to vote
 
03:38:00.710 --> 03:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
but I recognize that they don't have the
 
03:38:02.570 --> 03:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
cognitive capacity to make these
 
03:38:04.929 --> 03:38:04.939 align:start position:0%
decisions it's a Perfectly Natural
 
03:38:07.910 --> 03:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
developmental limitation but it's
 
03:38:09.889 --> 03:38:09.899 align:start position:0%
further Complicated by a very high
 
03:38:12.590 --> 03:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
Coincidence of serious psychiatric and
 
03:38:15.130 --> 03:38:15.140 align:start position:0%
psychological diagnoses including autism
 
03:38:19.070 --> 03:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
ADHD anxiety depression and most
 
03:38:21.170 --> 03:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
concerning suicidality that's really
 
03:38:23.210 --> 03:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here
 
03:38:25.610 --> 03:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
but no doctor should proceed with
 
03:38:28.190 --> 03:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
elective life-altering treatment while
 
03:38:29.809 --> 03:38:29.819 align:start position:0%
the patient's decision making is
 
03:38:32.389 --> 03:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
compromised by despair
 
03:38:36.290 --> 03:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
I ask that you support hb619 and please
 
03:38:38.870 --> 03:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 368 which you'll be hearing
 
03:38:41.809 --> 03:38:41.819 align:start position:0%
this afternoon please support and help

03:39:22.910 --> 03:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
the state and I'm here on behalf of my
 
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
local congregation in Plymouth Plymouth
 
03:39:27.050 --> 03:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
Congregational United Church of Christ
 
03:39:28.790 --> 03:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
I'm also speaking on behalf of the
 
03:39:31.670 --> 03:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
justice and witness Ministry of the New
 
03:39:34.550 --> 03:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Conference of our denomination
 
03:39:36.950 --> 03:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
I ask you to vote in opposition of House
 
03:39:40.550 --> 03:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 619 last fall our conference voted
 
03:39:43.309 --> 03:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
to affirm the worth and dignity of trans
 
03:39:47.510 --> 03:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
people in both society and the church I
 
03:39:49.729 --> 03:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
have that resolution for you so you can
 
03:39:51.349 --> 03:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
review it
 
03:39:53.750 --> 03:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
um our conference has publicly professed
 
03:39:55.610 --> 03:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
that we will as a large christian
 
03:39:58.570 --> 03:39:58.580 align:start position:0%
community stand against
 
03:40:01.429 --> 03:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
anti-trans legislation and policy so
 
03:40:03.590 --> 03:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
here I am primarily as a church leader
 
03:40:06.290 --> 03:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
it happens that this bill also pains me
 
03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
emotionally as someone who identifies
 
03:40:10.630 --> 03:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
with the non-binary and trans Community
 
03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
this bill shows legislative overreach
 
03:40:16.070 --> 03:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
and does not even fit the culture of New
 
03:40:19.070 --> 03:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know that Live Free or Die
 
03:40:22.130 --> 03:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
it's not our culture
 
03:40:24.590 --> 03:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
the care for Youth and adults with
 
03:40:27.469 --> 03:40:27.479 align:start position:0%
regard to any physical transitioning is
 
03:40:30.590 --> 03:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
slow and is careful
 
03:40:32.269 --> 03:40:32.279 align:start position:0%
this bill lacks empathy and
 
03:40:35.389 --> 03:40:35.399 align:start position:0%
understanding and this bill seeks to
 
03:40:37.849 --> 03:40:37.859 align:start position:0%
totally erase those who are born as
 
03:40:40.670 --> 03:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
intersex and that's a problem
 
03:40:42.530 --> 03:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
this bill would leave space for
 
03:40:45.170 --> 03:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
Guardians to coerce Youth and children
 
03:40:47.630 --> 03:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
into conversion therapy which has been
 
03:40:50.750 --> 03:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
shown to lead to an increased risk of
 
03:40:53.450 --> 03:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
self-harm and suicidal ideation and I
 
03:40:55.070 --> 03:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
just want to highlight the lawyer's
 
03:40:56.870 --> 03:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
comments about this would make us the
 
03:40:59.929 --> 03:40:59.939 align:start position:0%
first state to reverse that ban that's a
 
03:41:03.170 --> 03:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
problem even by being proposed this bill
 
03:41:05.690 --> 03:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
alienates families I know there are many
 
03:41:08.450 --> 03:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
families in our state experiencing deep
 
03:41:10.429 --> 03:41:10.439 align:start position:0%
emotional hurt because this bill is
 
03:41:11.750 --> 03:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
being considered
 
03:41:14.210 --> 03:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
I hope you will keep that in mind as it
 
03:41:16.969 --> 03:41:16.979 align:start position:0%
causes people like me to consider moving
 
03:41:19.490 --> 03:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
away from our state I give to Charities
 
03:41:22.370 --> 03:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
I support our state's community and so I
 
03:41:24.349 --> 03:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
hope that I and other families would be
 
03:41:27.889 --> 03:41:27.899 align:start position:0%
appreciated as such
 
03:41:30.050 --> 03:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
the effect of such legislation is
 
03:41:32.630 --> 03:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
stinging and offensive not only to the
 
03:41:36.050 --> 03:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
safety of people I care about but also
 
03:41:39.290 --> 03:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
to my own existence and to have to stand
 
03:41:42.889 --> 03:41:42.899 align:start position:0%
up here and defend that existence is
 
03:41:45.710 --> 03:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
biologically impacting me I've seen
 
03:41:47.870 --> 03:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
other people shaking and hearts are
 
03:41:50.150 --> 03:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
pounding so I hope you keep that in mind
 
03:41:57.250 --> 03:41:57.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:00.229 --> 03:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
I want to see Youth and families
 
03:42:03.050 --> 03:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
supported as a minister a person of
 
03:42:04.969 --> 03:42:04.979 align:start position:0%
faith and a resident of our state I want
 
03:42:07.130 --> 03:42:07.140 align:start position:0%
to see a society where all people are
 
03:42:08.870 --> 03:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
empowered where all people are
 
03:42:11.030 --> 03:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
metaphorically lifted up and where all
 
03:42:12.889 --> 03:42:12.899 align:start position:0%
people are honored I hope that you will
 
03:42:14.809 --> 03:42:14.819 align:start position:0%
reject this dangerous and unsympathetic
 
03:42:17.150 --> 03:42:17.160 align:start position:0%

bill and the irreparable harm that it
 
03:45:43.130 --> 03:45:43.140 align:start position:0%

03:46:55.429 --> 03:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
conversations with friends this is
 
03:46:58.550 --> 03:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
becoming a tidal wave for all children
 
03:47:03.170 --> 03:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:05.630 --> 03:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
um more and more detransitioners are
 
03:47:08.870 --> 03:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
coming out in fact there's one that I'm
 
03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
in contact with who took some sex
 
03:47:14.389 --> 03:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
hormones as a young child
 
03:47:16.130 --> 03:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
to become a boy
 
03:47:18.349 --> 03:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
she no longer wants to become a boy but
 
03:47:21.050 --> 03:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
she can no longer talk because her vocal
 
03:47:23.210 --> 03:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
cords were destroyed
 
03:47:26.150 --> 03:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
after just six months of taking hormone
 
03:47:26.160 --> 03:47:28.309 align:start position:0%
after just six months of taking hormone
therapy

03:47:28.309 --> 03:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
03:47:32.750 --> 03:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
she can't talk without extreme pain
 
03:47:34.910 --> 03:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
so when the doctors tell you that they
 
03:47:37.010 --> 03:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
don't know that there's irreversible
 
03:47:37.020 --> 03:47:38.870 align:start position:0%
don't know that there's irreversible
damage

03:47:38.870 --> 03:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
damage
 
03:47:42.110 --> 03:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
that right there is your clue they don't
 
03:47:44.090 --> 03:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
know because either they're not looking
 
03:47:47.630 --> 03:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
or they don't have enough evidence
 
03:47:50.150 --> 03:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
we have enough people coming out saying
 
03:47:52.150 --> 03:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
yes I've been harmed irreparable
 
03:47:55.250 --> 03:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
irreparably harmed and they're not being
 
03:47:57.410 --> 03:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
paid they're being chastised they're
 
03:47:59.929 --> 03:47:59.939 align:start position:0%
being assaulted they're being
 
03:48:02.450 --> 03:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
tell people tell them that they're lying
 
03:48:04.910 --> 03:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
nobody's listening to these people that
 
03:48:08.090 --> 03:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:09.889 --> 03:48:09.899 align:start position:0%
if you pay attention to what's happening
 
03:48:12.590 --> 03:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
in Milford there are kids playing games
 
03:48:15.410 --> 03:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
with the transgender policies
 
03:48:18.710 --> 03:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
there's a transgender girl who urinates
 
03:48:20.510 --> 03:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
in the girl in the girl's bathroom with
 
03:48:22.550 --> 03:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
the stall door opened exposing himself
 
03:48:27.229 --> 03:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
um please no outbursts
 
03:48:31.969 --> 03:48:31.979 align:start position:0%
there are true transgender people and
 
03:48:34.250 --> 03:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
then there's a whole Congregation of
 
03:48:37.190 --> 03:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
transgender boys boys that are playing
 
03:48:39.530 --> 03:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
under that umbrella
 
03:48:43.370 --> 03:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
to abuse and assault girls these are not
 
03:48:46.130 --> 03:48:46.140 align:start position:0%
true transgender people they're playing
 
03:48:48.710 --> 03:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
games with the school policies
 
03:48:51.590 --> 03:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
and other children are being assaulted
 
03:48:53.889 --> 03:48:53.899 align:start position:0%
if you can wrap up your testimony please
 
03:48:57.050 --> 03:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
excuse me we need to have silence so we
 
03:48:58.969 --> 03:48:58.979 align:start position:0%
can hear everybody else's testimony we
 
03:49:00.710 --> 03:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
have many other people to hear today and
 
03:49:02.210 --> 03:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
I would like to keep respect in the room
 
03:49:03.590 --> 03:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:07.190 --> 03:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
the UK Sweden France and Finland have
 
03:49:10.969 --> 03:49:10.979 align:start position:0%
all banned youth transgender policies
 
03:49:14.690 --> 03:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
they are no longer operating medically
 
03:49:16.670 --> 03:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
on transgender people they're all
 
03:49:19.070 --> 03:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
pulling back and looking at more
 
03:49:21.889 --> 03:49:21.899 align:start position:0%
evidence before they charge forward it's
 
03:49:23.690 --> 03:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
time we pay attention to what's really
 
03:49:25.790 --> 03:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
happening thank you
 
03:49:27.469 --> 03:49:27.479 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
03:49:31.250 --> 03:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none we have Jeremiah
 
03:49:36.410 --> 03:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:38.929 --> 03:49:38.939 align:start position:0%
Jeremiah and I am a 17 year old from
 
03:49:41.269 --> 03:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
Northampton and I am one of those
 
03:49:43.670 --> 03:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
opposed true transgender people I guess
 
03:49:46.610 --> 03:49:46.620 align:start position:0%
that she was talking about
 
03:49:48.830 --> 03:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
um I have been a resident of the state
 
03:49:51.889 --> 03:49:51.899 align:start position:0%
for almost my entire life I've been a
 
03:49:53.750 --> 03:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
part of my school's gsas I've been a
 
03:49:55.090 --> 03:49:55.100 align:start position:0%
part of organizations
 
03:49:59.210 --> 03:49:59.220 align:start position:0%
I have never seen anything like this in
 
03:50:01.990 --> 03:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
our legislative
 
03:50:05.030 --> 03:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
I for about eight months moved to
 
03:50:07.490 --> 03:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
Florida and I was called all sorts of
 
03:50:09.650 --> 03:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
slurs no matter what I was called no
 
03:50:11.150 --> 03:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
matter what I was wearing or what I was
 
03:50:13.010 --> 03:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
doing when I was working when I was
 
03:50:15.110 --> 03:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
getting my gas pumped I was called
 
03:50:17.229 --> 03:50:17.239 align:start position:0%
unspeakable things I will not repeat to
 
03:50:20.269 --> 03:50:20.279 align:start position:0%
the committee right now but it's
 
03:50:23.929 --> 03:50:23.939 align:start position:0%
seeing this in a place that is titled
 
03:50:27.769 --> 03:50:27.779 align:start position:0%
live for your die is atrocious it is
 
03:50:30.950 --> 03:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
devastating and I am also I would also
 
03:50:33.769 --> 03:50:33.779 align:start position:0%
like to cite what representative Roy
 
03:50:33.779 --> 03:50:35.050 align:start position:0%
like to cite what representative Roy
said

03:50:35.050 --> 03:50:35.060 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:50:37.630 --> 03:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
when he was testifying at the beginning
 
03:50:40.130 --> 03:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
where he quoted how do I get my breasts
 
03:50:40.140 --> 03:50:41.450 align:start position:0%
where he quoted how do I get my breasts
back

03:50:41.450 --> 03:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:50:43.910 --> 03:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
I have had mine gone for the most part
 
03:50:47.210 --> 03:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
for the past two years and I've never
 
03:50:49.429 --> 03:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
been happier I can say that with my full
 
03:50:49.439 --> 03:50:50.389 align:start position:0%
been happier I can say that with my full
chest

03:50:50.389 --> 03:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
chest
 
03:50:52.190 --> 03:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
the surgery when I woke up from surgery
 
03:50:54.290 --> 03:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
I was crying for three hours straight
 
03:50:56.990 --> 03:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
one because of the anesthetics and two
 
03:51:00.650 --> 03:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
because I was just so happy to
 
03:51:03.170 --> 03:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
figuratively have that off my chest and
 
03:51:05.809 --> 03:51:05.819 align:start position:0%
I was a much happier person a much
 
03:51:06.969 --> 03:51:06.979 align:start position:0%
better person
 
03:51:09.769 --> 03:51:09.779 align:start position:0%
I could do things that I couldn't do
 
03:51:12.410 --> 03:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
before like stand here and talk in front
 
03:51:12.420 --> 03:51:13.490 align:start position:0%
before like stand here and talk in front
of

03:51:13.490 --> 03:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:51:16.010 --> 03:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
whoever's watching right now
 
03:51:18.229 --> 03:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
and I just
 
03:51:21.769 --> 03:51:21.779 align:start position:0%
it's awful to hear what
 
03:51:24.250 --> 03:51:24.260 align:start position:0%
people like representative Roy are doing
 
03:51:27.710 --> 03:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
and to finish this up I would just like
 
03:51:29.630 --> 03:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
to read off
 
03:51:29.640 --> 03:51:30.290 align:start position:0%
to read off
um

03:51:30.290 --> 03:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
the note of a young girl
 
03:51:36.590 --> 03:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
who committed suicide when she was 17.
 
03:51:40.849 --> 03:51:40.859 align:start position:0%
and I am about 20 days from 18 and I
 
03:51:43.729 --> 03:51:43.739 align:start position:0%
will have outlived a number of my peers
 
03:51:45.950 --> 03:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
who have committed suicide who have
 
03:51:49.429 --> 03:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide and it's
 
03:51:49.439 --> 03:51:51.650 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide and it's
appalling

03:51:51.650 --> 03:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
appalling
 
03:51:55.130 --> 03:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
I that's all I can say about it
 
03:51:56.809 --> 03:51:56.819 align:start position:0%
here's what she wrote
 
03:51:58.849 --> 03:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
there's no way out I'm sad enough
 
03:52:00.830 --> 03:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
already I don't need my life to get any
 
03:52:02.990 --> 03:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
worse people say it gets better but
 
03:52:04.790 --> 03:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's not true in my case it gets worse
 
03:52:08.210 --> 03:52:08.220 align:start position:0%
every day I get worse that's the gist of
 
03:52:10.010 --> 03:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
it that's why I feel like killing myself
 
03:52:11.870 --> 03:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
sorry that's not a good enough reason
 
03:52:13.070 --> 03:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
for you but it's a good enough reason
 
03:52:16.070 --> 03:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
for me ask for my will I want a hundred
 
03:52:17.690 --> 03:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
percent of my things that I own to be
 
03:52:19.190 --> 03:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
legally sold and the money plus the
 
03:52:21.050 --> 03:52:21.060 align:start position:0%
money in the bank to be given to trans
 
03:52:23.150 --> 03:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
civil rights groups and support groups I
 
03:52:25.370 --> 03:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
don't give a which one
 
03:52:28.010 --> 03:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
the only way I can rest in peace is if
 
03:52:29.929 --> 03:52:29.939 align:start position:0%
one day transgender people aren't
 
03:52:32.150 --> 03:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
treated the way I was they're treated
 
03:52:34.010 --> 03:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
like humans without feelings and
 
03:52:36.110 --> 03:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
emotions gender needs to be taught about
 
03:52:38.630 --> 03:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
in schools the earlier the better my
 
03:52:41.809 --> 03:52:41.819 align:start position:0%
death needs to mean something my death
 
03:52:44.090 --> 03:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
needs to be counted in the number of
 
03:52:45.950 --> 03:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
transgender people who commit suicide
 
03:52:47.210 --> 03:52:47.220 align:start position:0%
this year
 
03:52:49.070 --> 03:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
I want someone to look at the number and
 
03:52:50.929 --> 03:52:50.939 align:start position:0%
say that's up
 
03:52:55.790 --> 03:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
fix it fix Society please
 
03:52:57.950 --> 03:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
03:53:00.290 --> 03:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
03:53:03.110 --> 03:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
I know that that was her late poem
 
03:53:05.210 --> 03:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
Manuel let's try and keep our language
 
03:53:07.070 --> 03:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
respectful but we can't ask that of her
 
03:53:10.010 --> 03:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
she gave a lot and also when we're
 
03:53:11.870 --> 03:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
speaking to people let's just try and
 
03:53:13.610 --> 03:53:13.620 align:start position:0%
make sure that we remain respectful so
 
03:53:15.170 --> 03:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
we can keep this good dialogue going
 
03:53:16.729 --> 03:53:16.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:53:20.269 --> 03:53:20.279 align:start position:0%

hello thank you for taking the time to

03:53:53.150 --> 03:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
did have to go but
 
03:53:55.450 --> 03:53:55.460 align:start position:0%

in New Hampshire attending our local

public schools across the state
 
03:54:09.410 --> 03:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
the first thing we learned about New
 
03:54:13.010 --> 03:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is our motto Live Free or Die
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
growing up with the rite of passage that
 
03:54:17.210 --> 03:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
freedom is so precious not even life can
 
03:54:19.309 --> 03:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
continue without it
 
03:54:21.530 --> 03:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
the rights for yourself called what you

03:54:26.510 --> 03:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
pronouns is an individual's freedom
 
03:54:28.309 --> 03:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
the three of us are not transgender or
 
03:54:30.650 --> 03:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
non-binary we have all been affected by
 
03:54:31.969 --> 03:54:31.979 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
03:54:34.610 --> 03:54:34.620 align:start position:0%
as we have family friends and peers that

as we have family friends and peers that
are

03:54:35.689 --> 03:54:35.699 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:54:37.969 --> 03:54:37.979 align:start position:0%
according to the CDC one of the top

three causes of death among teens is
 
03:54:39.840 --> 03:54:40.849 align:start position:0%
three causes of death among teens is
suicide

03:54:40.849 --> 03:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
03:54:42.769 --> 03:54:42.779 align:start position:0%
I've experienced depression and suicide
 
03:54:45.290 --> 03:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
personally and among my own family
 
03:54:47.510 --> 03:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
I can confidently say that losing a
 
03:54:49.790 --> 03:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
child because we banned health care that
 
03:54:51.050 --> 03:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
could have saved them instead of
 
03:54:53.870 --> 03:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
allowing them that
 
03:54:56.809 --> 03:54:56.819 align:start position:0%
sorry access is a failure upon us and
 
03:54:58.130 --> 03:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
our government
 
03:55:00.590 --> 03:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
we have an opportunity here as the Next
 
03:55:02.630 --> 03:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
Generation to be active in our community
 
03:55:05.030 --> 03:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
and make a stand for what we believe is
 
03:55:07.550 --> 03:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
right and wrong
 
03:55:09.650 --> 03:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
to watch someone you love go through the
 
03:55:12.170 --> 03:55:12.180 align:start position:0%
struggle of the world telling them not
 
03:55:14.210 --> 03:55:14.220 align:start position:0%
to be who they are is what emboldens us
 
03:55:16.910 --> 03:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
I'm scared of a world where the boxes we
 
03:55:18.469 --> 03:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
fit in become smaller and more
 
03:55:20.750 --> 03:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
restricted I'm scared of a world where
 
03:55:22.670 --> 03:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
my future children don't have the right
 
03:55:24.469 --> 03:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
to be themselves
 
03:55:26.330 --> 03:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
we should be focusing on helping these
 
03:55:28.130 --> 03:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
youth not tearing them and their mental
 
03:55:30.469 --> 03:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
health down we should refer to them as
 
03:55:32.450 --> 03:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
they wish allowing them access to gender
 
03:55:34.309 --> 03:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
affirming health care and giving them
 
03:55:37.550 --> 03:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
the respect because they are human too
 
03:55:39.950 --> 03:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
protecting NH children starts here and
 
03:55:42.650 --> 03:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
with opposing HP 619
 
03:55:45.050 --> 03:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
we will leave you with this if it was
 
03:55:46.969 --> 03:55:46.979 align:start position:0%
your child's wouldn't you want them to
 
03:55:49.250 --> 03:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
be happy Above All Else
 
03:55:50.990 --> 03:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
03:55:54.050 --> 03:55:54.060 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing no questions thank you
 
03:55:55.490 --> 03:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
very much and if you can give the
 
03:55:57.550 --> 03:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony we'd appreciate that
 
03:56:00.410 --> 03:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
next we have best scare followed by
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
Marie Daniels
 
03:56:04.250 --> 03:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
so I didn't give you a notification we
 
03:56:19.849 --> 03:56:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:23.210 --> 03:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
hi Beth scare from Nashua I'm reading
 
03:56:26.030 --> 03:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
the testimony from Aaron Brewer
 
03:56:30.170 --> 03:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
um she said I'm says I'm a former trans
 
03:56:32.330 --> 03:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
kid as a child I was insistent
 
03:56:34.309 --> 03:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
persistent and consistent that I was a
 
03:56:34.319 --> 03:56:35.330 align:start position:0%
persistent and consistent that I was a
boy

03:56:35.330 --> 03:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
boy
 
03:56:37.490 --> 03:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
I have no doubt that if the option to
 
03:56:39.469 --> 03:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
take puberty blockers and cross-sex
 
03:56:41.870 --> 03:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
hormones had been available I would have
 
03:56:43.610 --> 03:56:43.620 align:start position:0%
done everything I could to obtain them
 
03:56:46.429 --> 03:56:46.439 align:start position:0%
including threatening suicide especially
 
03:56:49.010 --> 03:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
if I had others encouraging me to
 
03:56:51.590 --> 03:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
threaten suicide as children are today
 
03:56:53.389 --> 03:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
in the short term I likely would have
 
03:56:54.490 --> 03:56:54.500 align:start position:0%
felt better
 
03:56:56.689 --> 03:56:56.699 align:start position:0%
testosterone is a controlled substance
 
03:56:59.030 --> 03:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
like other Controlled Substances it has
 
03:57:01.550 --> 03:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
high risks to health and well-being and
 
03:57:03.530 --> 03:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
has the potential for both addiction and
 
03:57:06.410 --> 03:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
abuse testosterone makes almost anyone
 
03:57:08.570 --> 03:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
who takes it initially
 
03:57:11.809 --> 03:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
initially feels a sense of euphoria
 
03:57:13.790 --> 03:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
if I had taken it a child it would have
 
03:57:15.769 --> 03:57:15.779 align:start position:0%
allowed me to completely disassociate
 
03:57:18.650 --> 03:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
for myself as a girl and create a new
 
03:57:20.809 --> 03:57:20.819 align:start position:0%
persona someone who could pretend that
 
03:57:23.030 --> 03:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
the horrible trauma that triggered my
 
03:57:26.150 --> 03:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria didn't happen to me
 
03:57:27.830 --> 03:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
when I first started taking it it would
 
03:57:29.750 --> 03:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
have boosted my confidence and increased
 
03:57:31.729 --> 03:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
my energy and most importantly I would
 
03:57:34.670 --> 03:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
have felt safer if I took testosterone
 
03:57:36.769 --> 03:57:36.779 align:start position:0%
it had been so much easier to pretend I
 
03:57:38.330 --> 03:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
was not that little girl who was
 
03:57:41.150 --> 03:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
brutally sexually assaulted
 
03:57:43.250 --> 03:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
a little girl who became convinced at
 
03:57:44.990 --> 03:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
the moment of the assault that I was not
 
03:57:47.389 --> 03:57:47.399 align:start position:0%
safe being a girl that the only way I
 
03:57:49.010 --> 03:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
could keep it from happening again was
 
03:57:51.229 --> 03:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
by becoming a boy
 
03:57:53.450 --> 03:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
despite feeling better in the short term
 
03:57:55.610 --> 03:57:55.620 align:start position:0%
in the long term taking testosterone
 
03:57:57.710 --> 03:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
would have been profoundly damaging
 
03:58:00.530 --> 03:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
potentially even more damaging than the
 
03:58:02.689 --> 03:58:02.699 align:start position:0%
sexual assault I can't imagine the
 
03:58:05.330 --> 03:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
impact of being told by teachers doctors
 
03:58:07.189 --> 03:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
and other adults that I was born in the
 
03:58:10.490 --> 03:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
wrong body that I was inherently flawed
 
03:58:12.590 --> 03:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
it would have been reinforced all the
 
03:58:14.750 --> 03:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
mistaken beliefs that I had had caused
 
03:58:16.670 --> 03:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
me to develop gender dysphoria in the
 
03:58:18.710 --> 03:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
first place
 
03:58:18.720 --> 03:58:19.610 align:start position:0%
first place
foreign

03:58:19.610 --> 03:58:19.620 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:58:22.969 --> 03:58:22.979 align:start position:0%
that being a girl was bad that it was my
 
03:58:25.309 --> 03:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
fault that those men hurt me that my
 
03:58:27.229 --> 03:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
body was a mistake that it was too
 
03:58:29.689 --> 03:58:29.699 align:start position:0%
dangerous to be a girl if I had been
 
03:58:31.370 --> 03:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
medically transitioned I wouldn't have
 
03:58:32.929 --> 03:58:32.939 align:start position:0%
gotten the help I needed to work through
 
03:58:35.630 --> 03:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
my self-hatred and shame I never would
 
03:58:37.189 --> 03:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
have realized that my transgender
 
03:58:40.370 --> 03:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
identity was a coping mechanism I'm so
 
03:58:42.410 --> 03:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
thankful my school psychologist put me
 
03:58:44.870 --> 03:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
on a healing path I'm grateful to other
 
03:58:46.490 --> 03:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
therapists who helped me understand that
 
03:58:48.469 --> 03:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
my transgender identity was a result of
 
03:58:50.630 --> 03:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
the sexual assault not because I was
 
03:58:52.550 --> 03:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
born in the wrong body I shudder to
 
03:58:54.650 --> 03:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
think at what my life would be like if
 
03:58:56.389 --> 03:58:56.399 align:start position:0%
I'd been encouraged to believe I was a
 
03:58:58.429 --> 03:58:58.439 align:start position:0%
boy I would have lived my life hating
 
03:59:00.830 --> 03:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
myself puberty blockers would have
 
03:59:03.010 --> 03:59:03.020 align:start position:0%
 my growth and development
 
03:59:05.210 --> 03:59:05.220 align:start position:0%
cross-sex hormones would have caused my
 
03:59:06.769 --> 03:59:06.779 align:start position:0%
otherwise healthy body to become
 
03:59:09.349 --> 03:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional the combination of both
 
03:59:10.969 --> 03:59:10.979 align:start position:0%
puberty and blockers and cross-sex
 
03:59:12.650 --> 03:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
hormones would have left me sterile
 
03:59:14.630 --> 03:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
children who say they feel better
 
03:59:15.950 --> 03:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
because of puberty blockers and
 
03:59:17.689 --> 03:59:17.699 align:start position:0%
cross-sex hormones are likely telling
 
03:59:19.429 --> 03:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
the truth in the short term these
 
03:59:21.110 --> 03:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
interventions allow children to avoid
 
03:59:23.630 --> 03:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
difficulties they're facing whether that
 
03:59:26.090 --> 03:59:26.100 align:start position:0%
be grappling grappling with internalized
 
03:59:28.429 --> 03:59:28.439 align:start position:0%
homophobia struggling with autism or
 
03:59:30.110 --> 03:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
trying to recover from a significant
 
03:59:32.269 --> 03:59:32.279 align:start position:0%
trauma we should not be giving children
 
03:59:34.250 --> 03:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
controlled substances in order to make
 
03:59:36.110 --> 03:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
them feel better it is a horrible
 
03:59:38.389 --> 03:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
disservice to encouraging them to
 
03:59:40.250 --> 03:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
dissociate to run away from their
 
03:59:42.050 --> 03:59:42.060 align:start position:0%
feelings or run away from themselves and
 
03:59:43.910 --> 03:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
to take a drug that in the short term
 
03:59:45.590 --> 03:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
will help them to feel better by numbing
 
03:59:47.870 --> 03:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
their feelings in the long term if you
 
03:59:49.429 --> 03:59:49.439 align:start position:0%
could summarize if you could submit the
 
03:59:51.050 --> 03:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
rest as testimony if you could put it
 
03:59:52.189 --> 03:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
through the portal everybody else will
 
03:59:54.290 --> 03:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
be able to read it as well permanently
 
03:59:55.969 --> 03:59:55.979 align:start position:0%
damage their bodies and long can prevent
 
03:59:57.590 --> 03:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
them from getting the help they need to
 
03:59:58.910 --> 03:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
understand the difficult feelings
 
04:00:00.650 --> 04:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
they've been having in the first place
 
04:00:03.950 --> 04:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
please vote OTP on HB 619 thank you
 
04:00:06.110 --> 04:00:06.120 align:start position:0%

from Barrington New Hampshire testifying
 
04:00:20.210 --> 04:00:20.220 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill I want to
 
04:00:22.189 --> 04:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
scream I'm a school psychologist and
 
04:00:23.990 --> 04:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
high school guidance counselor and the
 
04:00:25.910 --> 04:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
faculty advisor of my gay straight
 
04:00:29.030 --> 04:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
Alliance at my school I I started this
 
04:00:31.429 --> 04:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
club after one of our transgender
 
04:00:33.590 --> 04:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
students was hospitalized a second time
 
04:00:36.349 --> 04:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
for suicidality and I felt that I needed
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
to provide some supportive Community for
 
04:00:41.389 --> 04:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
these kids these kids are suffering
 
04:00:43.910 --> 04:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
they're experiencing bullying and
 
04:00:46.550 --> 04:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
ridicule and constant microaggressions
 
04:00:48.710 --> 04:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
and they're dying at their own hands
 
04:00:51.530 --> 04:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
because of it in contrast to the Cherry
 
04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
Picked data and widely debunked studies
 
04:00:58.130 --> 04:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
obliquely referenced it in this Hall and
 
04:01:00.410 --> 04:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
in this bill I want to leave you today
 
04:01:03.050 --> 04:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
with some legitimate research from the
 
04:01:05.210 --> 04:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
CDC the Journal of the American Medical
 
04:01:07.729 --> 04:01:07.739 align:start position:0%
Association the Journal of adolescent
 
04:01:09.830 --> 04:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
health from the Journal of interpersonal
 
04:01:13.150 --> 04:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
violence we know that 80 percent of
 
04:01:16.309 --> 04:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
transgender kids consider suicide in at
 
04:01:18.910 --> 04:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
least 40 percent attempt it
 
04:01:21.710 --> 04:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
This research confirms that the suicide
 
04:01:25.689 --> 04:01:25.699 align:start position:0%
risk plummets and mental health outcomes
 
04:01:29.870 --> 04:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
drastically improve when kids experience
 
04:01:31.550 --> 04:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
gender affirming treatment in
 
04:01:33.769 --> 04:01:33.779 align:start position:0%
communities as someone who has spent
 
04:01:35.990 --> 04:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
decades working with teenagers and in
 
04:01:39.050 --> 04:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
schools I can I can unequivocally tell
 
04:01:41.570 --> 04:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
you that they invented hysteria about
 
04:01:44.150 --> 04:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
locker rooms and bathrooms is just that
 
04:01:46.729 --> 04:01:46.739 align:start position:0%
invented these kids by and large if they
 
04:01:48.610 --> 04:01:48.620 align:start position:0%
don't have access to a private bathroom
 
04:01:51.830 --> 04:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
say in a nurse's office they are going
 
04:01:54.050 --> 04:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
to the bathroom they're not drinking all
 
04:01:55.910 --> 04:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
day they're waiting to till they can get
 
04:01:58.790 --> 04:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
home and go to the bathroom in uh in
 
04:01:58.800 --> 04:01:59.889 align:start position:0%
home and go to the bathroom in uh in
peace

04:01:59.889 --> 04:01:59.899 align:start position:0%
peace
 
04:02:02.150 --> 04:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
they don't want to go into locker rooms
 
04:02:04.130 --> 04:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
either one because they're afraid
 
04:02:05.450 --> 04:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
they're afraid of making anyone
 
04:02:06.889 --> 04:02:06.899 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable and they're afraid for
 
04:02:08.830 --> 04:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
their own safety and I can tell you
 
04:02:11.510 --> 04:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
heteronormative males are not sneaking
 
04:02:14.030 --> 04:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
into girls bathrooms and locker rooms to
 
04:02:15.410 --> 04:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
attack kids
 
04:02:17.809 --> 04:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
largely because they're so afraid of
 
04:02:19.610 --> 04:02:19.620 align:start position:0%
being called Gay they wouldn't set foot
 
04:02:22.189 --> 04:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
in those rooms so that's that that is an
 
04:02:24.170 --> 04:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
invented information that that people
 
04:02:25.729 --> 04:02:25.739 align:start position:0%
have referenced
 
04:02:28.010 --> 04:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
um if you could try to wrap up your
 
04:02:29.570 --> 04:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
testimony yep thank you I can tell you
 
04:02:31.250 --> 04:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
that transgender kids who need to need
 
04:02:33.650 --> 04:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
to satisfy PE requirements are taking
 
04:02:36.050 --> 04:02:36.060 align:start position:0%
classes that don't require that they go
 
04:02:38.389 --> 04:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
into to uh locker rooms and they're
 
04:02:40.969 --> 04:02:40.979 align:start position:0%
taking their PE classes online as far as
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
school staff respecting kids chosen
 
04:02:45.229 --> 04:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
names and pronouns the research I will
 
04:02:47.389 --> 04:02:47.399 align:start position:0%
show you solidly shows that these tiny
 
04:02:49.090 --> 04:02:49.100 align:start position:0%
kindnesses that we offer kids
 
04:02:51.469 --> 04:02:51.479 align:start position:0%
significantly decrease the kids suicide
 
04:02:54.229 --> 04:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
risk in closing I want to ask those of
 
04:02:55.969 --> 04:02:55.979 align:start position:0%
you who believe in the conservative
 
04:02:59.330 --> 04:02:59.340 align:start position:0%
values of parental rights and limited
 
04:03:00.830 --> 04:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
intrusion of the government into
 
04:03:04.610 --> 04:03:04.620 align:start position:0%
people's lives and local control please
 
04:03:06.590 --> 04:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
say no to this bill and allow these
 
04:03:08.510 --> 04:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
private medical decisions to remain in
 
04:03:10.250 --> 04:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
the hands of families and their
 
04:03:12.530 --> 04:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
Physicians and allow school districts to
 
04:03:14.450 --> 04:03:14.460 align:start position:0%
continue to decide how to best serve
 
04:03:16.670 --> 04:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
their own kids for those of you who feel
 
04:03:18.889 --> 04:03:18.899 align:start position:0%
you have a moral obligation to insinuate
 
04:03:20.630 --> 04:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
yourself into these very private
 
04:03:23.210 --> 04:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
decisions please know that if this bill
 
04:03:26.630 --> 04:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
cat passes more New Hampshire kids will
 
04:03:26.640 --> 04:03:27.889 align:start position:0%

a long day for you appreciate your time
 
04:04:17.750 --> 04:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
my name is Tom Carden I am a retired
 
04:04:19.729 --> 04:04:19.739 align:start position:0%
High School teacher I'm a former member
 
04:04:22.250 --> 04:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
of the House of Representatives and I am
 
04:04:26.090 --> 04:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
the grandfather of a transgender
 
04:04:28.309 --> 04:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
daughter who's the teenager
 
04:04:30.590 --> 04:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
she's well adjusted she's happy she's
 
04:04:33.889 --> 04:04:33.899 align:start position:0%
sweet and she's very courageous
 
04:04:35.929 --> 04:04:35.939 align:start position:0%
we really didn't know what was going on
 
04:04:38.229 --> 04:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
for with Ali At first
 
04:04:41.689 --> 04:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
she when she was four she was in the
 
04:04:44.210 --> 04:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
hospital she got Salmonella poisoning
 
04:04:46.610 --> 04:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
and of course I taught Food Service
 
04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
sanitation and we were worried that she
 
04:04:50.330 --> 04:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
was going to die
 
04:04:53.990 --> 04:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
so she's in her bed one day and all of a
 
04:04:57.110 --> 04:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
sudden on the TV a Barbie doll shows up
 
04:04:59.929 --> 04:04:59.939 align:start position:0%
jumped up that's where I want Mommy
 
04:05:02.929 --> 04:05:02.939 align:start position:0%
so her mother went out and bought her a
 
04:05:05.210 --> 04:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
Barbie doll and then things kind of
 
04:05:07.189 --> 04:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
progressed she started getting these
 
04:05:11.330 --> 04:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
really kind of cute hair pieces and then
 
04:05:13.849 --> 04:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
we started realizing that that she's
 
04:05:13.859 --> 04:05:14.929 align:start position:0%
we started realizing that that she's
different

04:05:14.929 --> 04:05:14.939 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:05:17.110 --> 04:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
and it was okay
 
04:05:20.750 --> 04:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that my daughter
 
04:05:22.729 --> 04:05:22.739 align:start position:0%
agonized about is what's going to happen
 
04:05:24.889 --> 04:05:24.899 align:start position:0%
when she goes to school
 
04:05:26.750 --> 04:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
she had lots of sleepless nights where
 
04:05:31.189 --> 04:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:33.530 --> 04:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
but she did what she was supposed to do
 
04:05:35.870 --> 04:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
she advocated for her daughter
 
04:05:38.750 --> 04:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
and the school was pretty supportive at
 
04:05:40.849 --> 04:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
first and you know it's kind of hard
 
04:05:43.490 --> 04:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
because you know Ally wanted to wear
 
04:05:46.910 --> 04:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
girls clothes to school and of course
 
04:05:49.910 --> 04:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
she she couldn't at the time and you
 
04:05:53.269 --> 04:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
know again the advocacy and a very good
 
04:05:54.769 --> 04:05:54.779 align:start position:0%
school system allowed her to start
 
04:05:57.290 --> 04:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
wearing all right girl schools just
 
04:05:59.389 --> 04:05:59.399 align:start position:0%
girls close to school
 
04:05:59.399 --> 04:06:01.610 align:start position:0%
girls close to school
and

04:06:01.610 --> 04:06:01.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know she she didn't wake up one day
 
04:06:06.889 --> 04:06:06.899 align:start position:0%
and decide that you know I want to be
 
04:06:09.229 --> 04:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
trans this has been a long process for
 
04:06:10.790 --> 04:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
her it's been 10 years
 
04:06:13.130 --> 04:06:13.140 align:start position:0%
and I think anybody is that way it's not
 
04:06:16.189 --> 04:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
like it's cool you know they're they're
 
04:06:19.610 --> 04:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
discriminated against they're bullied
 
04:06:21.590 --> 04:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
State legislations make laws against
 
04:06:21.600 --> 04:06:22.670 align:start position:0%
State legislations make laws against
them

04:06:22.670 --> 04:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:06:25.790 --> 04:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
and you know she it's just who she is
 
04:06:28.250 --> 04:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
and that's all she wants to to be
 
04:06:30.110 --> 04:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
you know she just wants to blend in like
 
04:06:32.090 --> 04:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
the rest of all of us
 
04:06:34.729 --> 04:06:34.739 align:start position:0%
um you know it's a very vulnerable
 
04:06:34.739 --> 04:06:37.130 align:start position:0%
um you know it's a very vulnerable
population

04:06:37.130 --> 04:06:37.140 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:06:39.469 --> 04:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
and you know they really they need
 
04:06:41.150 --> 04:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
support more than anything they don't
 
04:06:43.550 --> 04:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
need laws made against them and I would
 
04:06:46.070 --> 04:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
hope you would oppose this bill and in
 
04:06:48.050 --> 04:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
all honesty
 
04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
um and I'll go back to the legislature
 
04:06:52.370 --> 04:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
you know any decisions on their health
 
04:06:54.910 --> 04:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
care should be made between the patient
 
04:06:58.790 --> 04:06:58.800 align:start position:0%

I'm Stephen scare of Nashua and I urge

HB 619
 
04:08:03.650 --> 04:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
earlier we were talking about puberty
 
04:08:05.689 --> 04:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
blockers and according to Marcy Bowers
 
04:08:08.269 --> 04:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
the president of the world associate
 
04:08:10.130 --> 04:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
World Professional Association of
 
04:08:11.929 --> 04:08:11.939 align:start position:0%
transgender Health which sets the
 
04:08:15.290 --> 04:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
standards for treatment a child who
 
04:08:17.689 --> 04:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
starts puberty blockers and then goes on
 
04:08:20.330 --> 04:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
to opposite sex hormones which almost
 
04:08:22.910 --> 04:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
all do will never have any sexual
 
04:08:25.370 --> 04:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
function never be able to experience
 
04:08:28.550 --> 04:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
intimacy Marcy Bowers Compares that to
 
04:08:31.330 --> 04:08:31.340 align:start position:0%
female genital mutilation
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
activist claims the laws that end the
 
04:08:36.290 --> 04:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
practice of treating gender dysphoria
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
with hormones and surgery deny
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
life-saving care or claiming they
 
04:08:42.590 --> 04:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
support with astronomical suicide
 
04:08:46.370 --> 04:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
figures but just last month Dr watalia
 
04:08:49.550 --> 04:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
Catalina finland's leading pediatric
 
04:08:52.130 --> 04:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
gender medical experts who aren't that
 
04:08:54.830 --> 04:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
and I quote it is not justified to tell
 
04:08:57.410 --> 04:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
the parents of young people experiencing
 
04:08:59.929 --> 04:08:59.939 align:start position:0%
transgenderism that the young person is
 
04:09:02.330 --> 04:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
at risk of suicide without corrective
 
04:09:04.189 --> 04:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
treatment and the danger can be
 
04:09:06.229 --> 04:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
countered with gender reassignment
 
04:09:09.170 --> 04:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
treatment she cited 12 studies that
 
04:09:10.790 --> 04:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that if you allowed children
 
04:09:13.550 --> 04:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
to go through natural puberty four out
 
04:09:15.950 --> 04:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
of five will outgrow their dysphoria the
 
04:09:17.870 --> 04:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
most recent one was and the largest one
 
04:09:20.269 --> 04:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
was just two years ago which showed an
 
04:09:23.210 --> 04:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
assistance rate of over 87 percent
 
04:09:26.269 --> 04:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
so why the differences between U.S
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
policies and the health policies of
 
04:09:32.210 --> 04:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
Finland England and Sweden countries
 
04:09:33.349 --> 04:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
which have dropped the gender
 
04:09:36.110 --> 04:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
affirmative model of puberty blockers
 
04:09:38.210 --> 04:09:38.220 align:start position:0%
and opposite sex hormones
 
04:09:41.150 --> 04:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
the Trevor Project statistics are from
 
04:09:43.250 --> 04:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
self-report surveys
 
04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
solicited on LGBT sites not from a
 
04:09:49.490 --> 04:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
review of the actual suicide rates the
 
04:09:51.889 --> 04:09:51.899 align:start position:0%
youth risks of ia2 those are
 
04:09:54.530 --> 04:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
self-reports and according to that it's
 
04:09:57.769 --> 04:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
nine percent of all all youth have
 
04:10:00.969 --> 04:10:00.979 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide but the actual rate is
 
04:10:04.910 --> 04:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
.014 according to the CDC
 
04:10:07.610 --> 04:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
a review of the data from the world's
 
04:10:09.849 --> 04:10:09.859 align:start position:0%
largest pediatric gender Clinic
 
04:10:13.150 --> 04:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
indicated a suicide rate of
 
04:10:17.090 --> 04:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
0.03 percent were trans identified youth
 
04:10:19.189 --> 04:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
although this is higher than the average
 
04:10:21.889 --> 04:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
suicide rate it's similar to suicide
 
04:10:24.050 --> 04:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
rates for youth with other mental health
 
04:10:26.330 --> 04:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
conditions and lower for them the
 
04:10:30.349 --> 04:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
suicide rates for autism and anorexia
 
04:10:33.309 --> 04:10:33.319 align:start position:0%
another study of 2 800 children
 
04:10:36.170 --> 04:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
concludes that suicidal suicide
 
04:10:38.090 --> 04:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
suicidality among transgender
 
04:10:40.429 --> 04:10:40.439 align:start position:0%
identifying youth is only somewhat
 
04:10:42.590 --> 04:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
higher than those being treated for
 
04:10:44.630 --> 04:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
mental other mental health issues which
 
04:10:46.309 --> 04:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
many have
 
04:10:48.830 --> 04:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
whatever decisions you make I hope it
 
04:10:52.070 --> 04:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
won't be for under duress or coercion as
 
04:10:54.530 --> 04:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
detransitioner in one of thousands if
 
04:10:56.330 --> 04:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
not tens of thousands of de-transition
 
04:10:58.969 --> 04:10:58.979 align:start position:0%
or Chloe Cole said I hear emotional
 
04:11:01.429 --> 04:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
blackmail at these hearings constantly
 
04:11:04.250 --> 04:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
their blood will be on your hands gender
 
04:11:06.590 --> 04:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
dysphoric kids are listening shoving the
 
04:11:09.050 --> 04:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
idea that it's trans or suicide will
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
harm the youth children are not Martyrs
 
04:11:14.510 --> 04:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
for your political ideology thank you
 
04:11:17.090 --> 04:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you seeing no
 
04:11:18.889 --> 04:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
questions for the committee thank you
 
04:11:20.990 --> 04:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
very much we have Victoria gulla
 
04:11:28.250 --> 04:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:32.510 --> 04:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
hi thank you I want to just uh quickly
 
04:11:36.650 --> 04:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
address the girls from UNH I am a mother
 
04:11:38.929 --> 04:11:38.939 align:start position:0%
and I don't try to make my children
 
04:11:38.939 --> 04:11:40.010 align:start position:0%
and I don't try to make my children
happy

04:11:40.010 --> 04:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
happy
 
04:11:43.250 --> 04:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
my goal in life is not to raise or to
 
04:11:45.290 --> 04:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
have happy children I need my children
 
04:11:48.590 --> 04:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
to experience up and downs and pains so
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
that they can learn to cope so no I
 
04:11:52.610 --> 04:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
don't give my kids candy all the time I
 
04:11:54.590 --> 04:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
don't let them watch endless TV and and
 
04:11:55.849 --> 04:11:55.859 align:start position:0%
everything because I'm the mother and
 
04:11:57.410 --> 04:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
I'm the adult in the house
 
04:11:59.389 --> 04:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
so I want to give you an education on
 
04:12:01.790 --> 04:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
where why we're here we're here because
 
04:12:05.030 --> 04:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
this is actually Marxist theology it's
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
in the literature it goes back to 1984
 
04:12:11.389 --> 04:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
where they first brought in queer Theory
 
04:12:13.610 --> 04:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
into the academic
 
04:12:18.110 --> 04:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
um papers and I to give you an
 
04:12:20.570 --> 04:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
understanding of my history and my
 
04:12:22.790 --> 04:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
education I graduated from conduit High
 
04:12:24.950 --> 04:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
School in 1991 I went to McGill
 
04:12:27.110 --> 04:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
University in Canada and I graduated in
 
04:12:31.010 --> 04:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
1995 and I studied the history and
 
04:12:34.610 --> 04:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
politics of tyrannical regimes which of
 
04:12:37.510 --> 04:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
course included Marxism fascism
 
04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
French Revolution so for me I recognize
 
04:12:43.490 --> 04:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
the language because I studied it in the
 
04:12:45.889 --> 04:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
context of History what I didn't do is I
 
04:12:47.990 --> 04:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the College of Education and
 
04:12:49.370 --> 04:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
this was kind of coming into the
 
04:12:51.349 --> 04:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
colleges of education at this time
 
04:12:53.689 --> 04:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
really the queer Theory came into the
 
04:12:56.570 --> 04:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
colleges of Education in 1993 and 1994
 
04:12:58.910 --> 04:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
so I was on my way out of college by
 
04:13:00.650 --> 04:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
that time and again I wasn't in the
 
04:13:01.670 --> 04:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
College of Education I was in the
 
04:13:04.490 --> 04:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
College of Arts or the faculty of Arts
 
04:13:04.500 --> 04:13:05.870 align:start position:0%
College of Arts or the faculty of Arts
so

04:13:05.870 --> 04:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:13:08.150 --> 04:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
um as part of queer Theory what they
 
04:13:10.130 --> 04:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
want to do is they want to destabilize
 
04:13:12.410 --> 04:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
you can't have a Marxist revolution in a
 
04:13:14.090 --> 04:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
stable Society because people are happy
 
04:13:16.309 --> 04:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
so what they found that in the western
 
04:13:18.650 --> 04:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
societies the marxists realized you're
 
04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
never going to be able to bring about
 
04:13:22.189 --> 04:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
Marx's revolution in Europe because
 
04:13:23.990 --> 04:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
those societies were happy they couldn't
 
04:13:25.729 --> 04:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
do it in the United States because we
 
04:13:27.050 --> 04:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
weren't happy
 
04:13:30.410 --> 04:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
stable country so in order to bring
 
04:13:32.150 --> 04:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
about Marxist Revolution they needed to
 
04:13:34.429 --> 04:13:34.439 align:start position:0%
destabilize and part of that data
 
04:13:34.439 --> 04:13:36.410 align:start position:0%
destabilize and part of that data
stabilization

04:13:36.410 --> 04:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
stabilization
 
04:13:39.050 --> 04:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
is making people themselves the
 
04:13:41.929 --> 04:13:41.939 align:start position:0%
individual unstable and that's why it's
 
04:13:44.030 --> 04:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
so subversive and that's why what has
 
04:13:46.370 --> 04:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
happened to these people in this room is
 
04:13:48.950 --> 04:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
so cruel because marxists don't care
 
04:13:50.389 --> 04:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
about the individual they only care
 
04:13:52.370 --> 04:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
about the collective and they don't care
 
04:13:55.429 --> 04:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
if they mentally and physically abuse
 
04:13:58.450 --> 04:13:58.460 align:start position:0%
people they don't care if they murder
 
04:14:00.830 --> 04:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
the people in the Ukraine during the
 
04:14:04.010 --> 04:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
halamador where they starved five
 
04:14:06.590 --> 04:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
million people they don't care now as
 
04:14:08.929 --> 04:14:08.939 align:start position:0%
China and actually the term brainwashing
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
comes from the Chinese literally the
 
04:14:13.070 --> 04:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
people coming out of the camps were
 
04:14:15.110 --> 04:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
interviewed and they talked about
 
04:14:18.410 --> 04:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
um being brainwashed and that's we also
 
04:14:20.929 --> 04:14:20.939 align:start position:0%
call that re-education camps so for all
 
04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
of you it's very sad but you have been
 
04:14:26.870 --> 04:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
brainwashed the reason that someone my
 
04:14:29.809 --> 04:14:29.819 align:start position:0%
age I just turned 50 doesn't have all
 
04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
these peers and we didn't have all this
 
04:14:33.170 --> 04:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
LGBT stuff in schools because it didn't
 
04:14:35.990 --> 04:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
exist because it hadn't hit the pedagogy
 
04:14:39.650 --> 04:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
in the colleges of education so that's
 
04:14:42.410 --> 04:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
what they do they are creating all of
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
these kids and they're destabilizing
 
04:14:46.429 --> 04:14:46.439 align:start position:0%
them and part of it also is to remove
 
04:14:48.309 --> 04:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
the child's relationship from the parent
 
04:14:52.790 --> 04:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
and in doing so you can also attach that
 
04:14:55.130 --> 04:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
child to a teacher you can attach it to
 
04:14:57.410 --> 04:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
a caring adult in a safe Space by saying
 
04:14:58.610 --> 04:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
that you have safe spaces at school
 
04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
you're saying that you don't have a safe
 
04:15:02.150 --> 04:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
space at home so if you didn't include
 
04:15:03.590 --> 04:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony we do have some questions
 
04:15:04.910 --> 04:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
for you
 
04:15:09.130 --> 04:15:09.140 align:start position:0%
this this is a an attempt and they again
 
04:15:12.670 --> 04:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
they're they're abusing these people
 
04:15:15.950 --> 04:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
physically and mentally to
 
04:15:18.410 --> 04:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
to pull kids and destabilize society and
 
04:15:19.790 --> 04:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
if you see the Mental Health crisis in
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
the state and everywhere I went to
 
04:15:23.090 --> 04:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
conval the principal there says the
 
04:15:24.830 --> 04:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
number one issue at conval is mental
 
04:15:26.750 --> 04:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
health that wasn't so when I graduated
 
04:15:29.269 --> 04:15:29.279 align:start position:0%

04:17:56.150 --> 04:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
else in the middle
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you also as a parent of a
 
04:18:01.849 --> 04:18:01.859 align:start position:0%
transgender girl
 
04:18:03.950 --> 04:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
who came out
 
04:18:08.389 --> 04:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:10.189 --> 04:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
she doesn't have any bad side effects
 
04:18:12.769 --> 04:18:12.779 align:start position:0%
she's healthy she graduated in the top
 
04:18:16.010 --> 04:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
10 of her class she's in college she's
 
04:18:17.630 --> 04:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
very happy
 
04:18:20.750 --> 04:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with a happy child
 
04:18:20.760 --> 04:18:21.889 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with a happy child
um

04:18:21.889 --> 04:18:21.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:24.290 --> 04:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
she's well adjusted she's well adjusted
 
04:18:26.570 --> 04:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
because of school supporter
 
04:18:29.809 --> 04:18:29.819 align:start position:0%
the sports team supported her her friend
 
04:18:32.269 --> 04:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
supported her when it came for Timeless
 
04:18:34.910 --> 04:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
sleepovers the other parents supported
 
04:18:34.920 --> 04:18:35.929 align:start position:0%
sleepovers the other parents supported
her

04:18:35.929 --> 04:18:35.939 align:start position:0%
her
 
04:18:39.170 --> 04:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
she was treated exactly how she came out
 
04:18:41.030 --> 04:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
and that's what I would expect moving
 
04:18:42.650 --> 04:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
forward in a state that says Live Free
 
04:18:44.090 --> 04:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
or Die
 
04:18:45.769 --> 04:18:45.779 align:start position:0%
be yourself
 
04:18:48.830 --> 04:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
be good to other people
 
04:18:51.410 --> 04:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
and that's the way it should be so I
 
04:18:53.630 --> 04:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
hope that you guys will either vote this
 
04:18:57.469 --> 04:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
down or at least table it and not push
 
04:18:58.670 --> 04:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
this forward
 
04:19:00.830 --> 04:19:00.840 align:start position:0%

04:19:02.570 --> 04:19:02.580 align:start position:0%

I urge you all to vote inexpedient to
 
04:19:45.889 --> 04:19:45.899 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 619
 
04:19:47.990 --> 04:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
today you're hearing many good reasons
 
04:19:50.510 --> 04:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
to ICL this bill from my neighbors who
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
are in the healthcare mental health and
 
04:19:54.469 --> 04:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
educational communities
 
04:19:56.570 --> 04:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
they have told you the truth and I hope
 
04:19:58.490 --> 04:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
that you listen because it is the truth
 
04:20:01.370 --> 04:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
that sets us all free
 
04:20:03.469 --> 04:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from other religious leaders
 
04:20:05.870 --> 04:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
who although this bill invokes religious
 
04:20:08.630 --> 04:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
Faith are witnesses to people of Faith
 
04:20:12.170 --> 04:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
who love and affirm lgbtq plus neighbors
 
04:20:14.450 --> 04:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
just as they are
 
04:20:17.630 --> 04:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
my testimony will begin and end with
 
04:20:20.870 --> 04:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
page one of this bill
 
04:20:24.229 --> 04:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
as I saw this bill state that it is it
 
04:20:26.349 --> 04:20:26.359 align:start position:0%
takes its compelling interest
 
04:20:29.210 --> 04:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
directly from the smallness of the
 
04:20:31.550 --> 04:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
numbers of the transgender population of
 
04:20:32.929 --> 04:20:32.939 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:20:35.689 --> 04:20:35.699 align:start position:0%
the bill is very clear it wants to bring
 
04:20:38.389 --> 04:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
the full force of law
 
04:20:40.729 --> 04:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
and to bring along with it the mental
 
04:20:42.349 --> 04:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
health health care and educational
 
04:20:45.170 --> 04:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
sectors along with it to bring all of
 
04:20:48.050 --> 04:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
this Force to a vulnerable Community it
 
04:20:51.349 --> 04:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
is a Goliath of a bill
 
04:20:53.870 --> 04:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
the Bill's sponsors are quite ready to
 
04:20:58.189 --> 04:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
claim that mantle as an excuse to harm a
 
04:20:59.809 --> 04:20:59.819 align:start position:0%
small community
 
04:21:01.429 --> 04:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
now when I was growing up in Sunday
 
04:21:03.650 --> 04:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
school I was always taught the story of
 
04:21:06.349 --> 04:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
David and Goliath
 
04:21:10.370 --> 04:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
you as always every time about bullies
 
04:21:12.590 --> 04:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
and the importance of standing up to
 
04:21:15.110 --> 04:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
bullies and their intended victims
 
04:21:17.750 --> 04:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
and with and for their intended victims
 
04:21:20.210 --> 04:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
because the bill uses religious language
 
04:21:22.130 --> 04:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
I will use a religious definition of
 
04:21:23.389 --> 04:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
bullying that comes from the southern
 
04:21:25.729 --> 04:21:25.739 align:start position:0%
baptist convention's own ethics and
 
04:21:27.769 --> 04:21:27.779 align:start position:0%
religious liberty commission that has
 
04:21:29.630 --> 04:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
three characteristics
 
04:21:32.929 --> 04:21:32.939 align:start position:0%

bullying is intentional and there is no
 
04:22:37.130 --> 04:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
more clear intention than a 15-page
 
04:22:40.250 --> 04:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
written plan to document the harm that

Franklin and I come before you today to
 
04:24:26.750 --> 04:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
ask you to protect the vulnerable
 
04:24:29.090 --> 04:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
children of our state by voting in
 
04:24:31.250 --> 04:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
expedience to legislate on House Bill
 
04:24:31.260 --> 04:24:33.229 align:start position:0%
expedience to legislate on House Bill
619

04:24:33.229 --> 04:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
619
 
04:24:35.030 --> 04:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
I have heard today from proponents of
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
this bill that what they are most
 
04:24:39.050 --> 04:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
interested in is protecting the children
 
04:24:41.990 --> 04:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
of this state but they have let their
 
04:24:44.929 --> 04:24:44.939 align:start position:0%
own agenda prevent them from seeing the
 
04:24:44.939 --> 04:24:46.250 align:start position:0%
own agenda prevent them from seeing the
facts

04:24:46.250 --> 04:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
facts
 
04:24:48.229 --> 04:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
the medical consensus is that children
 
04:24:51.229 --> 04:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
and youth are not at risk from their
 
04:24:53.809 --> 04:24:53.819 align:start position:0%
transgender classmates it is transgender
 
04:24:55.969 --> 04:24:55.979 align:start position:0%
students themselves who are at
 
04:24:58.729 --> 04:24:58.739 align:start position:0%
significant risk of violence and death
 
04:25:00.830 --> 04:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
a U.S and Canadian study published just
 
04:25:02.389 --> 04:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
last year in the Journal of
 
04:25:04.790 --> 04:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
interpersonal violence showed that 56
 
04:25:06.830 --> 04:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
percent of trans youth reported a
 
04:25:10.330 --> 04:25:10.340 align:start position:0%
previous suicide attempt and 86 percent
 
04:25:13.130 --> 04:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
reported Suicidal Thoughts
 
04:25:15.590 --> 04:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
if we are truly interested if we are
 
04:25:17.809 --> 04:25:17.819 align:start position:0%
truly interested in protecting our
 
04:25:19.849 --> 04:25:19.859 align:start position:0%
children then this bill goes about it
 
04:25:20.990 --> 04:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
all wrong
 
04:25:23.330 --> 04:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
because the study showed what other
 
04:25:26.330 --> 04:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
Studies have affirmed in the past
 
04:25:29.090 --> 04:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
that what reduces trans student suicide
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
rates was having a supportive and
 
04:25:33.769 --> 04:25:33.779 align:start position:0%
affirming School environment a
 
04:25:35.150 --> 04:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
supportive and affirming family
 
04:25:38.330 --> 04:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
supporting and affirming Medical Care
 
04:25:40.550 --> 04:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
and people in their lives who affirmed
 
04:25:42.590 --> 04:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
them as the people that they know
 
04:25:45.769 --> 04:25:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:47.870 --> 04:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of this bill have refused
 
04:25:50.149 --> 04:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
to see the facts but they have also
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
refused to see the truth
 
04:25:54.530 --> 04:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
because transgender children as we have
 
04:25:57.469 --> 04:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
heard today are not just statistics
 
04:26:01.550 --> 04:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
I have been on the phone at 1am talking
 
04:26:03.950 --> 04:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
to a youth whose family has rejected
 
04:26:05.870 --> 04:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
them for being trans
 
04:26:08.030 --> 04:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
whose school is not a safe place for
 
04:26:08.040 --> 04:26:08.809 align:start position:0%
whose school is not a safe place for
them

04:26:08.809 --> 04:26:08.819 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:26:11.689 --> 04:26:11.699 align:start position:0%
their family has made having a place to
 
04:26:13.849 --> 04:26:13.859 align:start position:0%
live be contingent on that child against
 
04:26:17.090 --> 04:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
their will going into conversion therapy
 
04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
and I have stayed on the phone with them
 
04:26:22.790 --> 04:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
through the night begging them not to
 
04:26:24.769 --> 04:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
end their life
 
04:26:27.290 --> 04:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
promising them that the world is better
 
04:26:29.570 --> 04:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
with them here that the world is
 
04:26:32.330 --> 04:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
changing that things are hard so hard
 
04:26:35.630 --> 04:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
right now but one day it will be safe
 
04:26:37.330 --> 04:26:37.340 align:start position:0%
for them
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
hb619 makes it harder to keep that
 
04:26:39.840 --> 04:26:41.630 align:start position:0%
hb619 makes it harder to keep that
promise

04:26:41.630 --> 04:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
promise
 
04:26:44.570 --> 04:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
Matthew 7 16 says we will know the truth
 
04:26:47.149 --> 04:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
of things by their fruits many of the
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
proponents of this bill have cited their
 
04:26:51.410 --> 04:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
Christian faith but there is nothing of
 
04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
God and a bill that would rather
 
04:26:55.969 --> 04:26:55.979 align:start position:0%
transgender children be dead
 
04:26:58.610 --> 04:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
than be themselves
 
04:27:02.090 --> 04:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
trans kids are our kids they are God's
 
04:27:04.790 --> 04:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
kids they are New Hampshire's kids and
 
04:27:06.410 --> 04:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
they need our help
 
04:27:10.670 --> 04:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
please vote itl on hb619 thank you thank
 
04:27:12.170 --> 04:27:12.180 align:start position:0%

we have William Jewell followed by Iris
terrella

04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
terrella
 
04:27:23.929 --> 04:27:23.939 align:start position:0%
William here yes it's fantastic I
 
04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
apologize I'm short so
 
04:27:30.229 --> 04:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes people won't see me so uh I'm
 
04:27:32.570 --> 04:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh I'm Bill Jolly I live in Groton which
 
04:27:35.990 --> 04:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
is in Grafton County and usually dads
 
04:27:37.610 --> 04:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
are relegated to the role of being an
 
04:27:40.309 --> 04:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
ATM with a teenage daughter or uh to
 
04:27:42.469 --> 04:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
giving bad jokes but I'm here for a
 
04:27:45.170 --> 04:27:45.180 align:start position:0%
different reason one of couple reasons
 
04:27:48.110 --> 04:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
but one is that my daughter is not trans
 
04:27:49.729 --> 04:27:49.739 align:start position:0%
she's not gay
 
04:27:52.370 --> 04:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
she's been taught and she Embraces the
 
04:27:55.189 --> 04:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
notion of loving everybody
 
04:27:58.189 --> 04:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
and I take offense at being called
 
04:28:00.710 --> 04:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
hateful especially by people of the
 
04:28:00.720 --> 04:28:01.849 align:start position:0%
hateful especially by people of the
cloth

04:28:01.849 --> 04:28:01.859 align:start position:0%
cloth
 
04:28:03.889 --> 04:28:03.899 align:start position:0%
because I feel strongly in my beliefs
 
04:28:06.170 --> 04:28:06.180 align:start position:0%
and I can pull a paragraph a line out of
 
04:28:07.550 --> 04:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
the Bible too but I'm not going to do
 
04:28:09.170 --> 04:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
that today so I'm just going to leave
 
04:28:11.750 --> 04:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
that right there that is an unfair and
 
04:28:13.610 --> 04:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
ungodly way to act
 
04:28:16.969 --> 04:28:16.979 align:start position:0%
so to go to the matter at hand I'm here
 
04:28:19.910 --> 04:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
in support of Bill 619
 
04:28:23.389 --> 04:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
and that should be OTP
 
04:28:25.130 --> 04:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
I want to direct everybody's attention
 
04:28:26.809 --> 04:28:26.819 align:start position:0%
we have all these statistics swimming
 
04:28:28.189 --> 04:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
around in the sky right now they're
 
04:28:30.889 --> 04:28:30.899 align:start position:0%
being thrown at you guys and Mark Twain
 
04:28:33.889 --> 04:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
I taught defense analysis a section of
 
04:28:36.769 --> 04:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
it to the Army not in an academic an
 
04:28:39.590 --> 04:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
academic sense but there's lies damn
 
04:28:41.510 --> 04:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
lies and statistics right that was Mark
 
04:28:43.189 --> 04:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
Twain or at least he gets credit for it
 
04:28:45.530 --> 04:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to do that to you I
 
04:28:49.250 --> 04:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
will point out the one fact that the
 
04:28:52.189 --> 04:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
exponential rise in teenage suicide
 
04:28:57.530 --> 04:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
happened around 2009 to 2014 depending
 
04:29:00.530 --> 04:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
on which statistical
 
04:29:03.469 --> 04:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
data you look at right and so my
 
04:29:05.149 --> 04:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
question is and it's only a question
 
04:29:07.670 --> 04:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's one to ponder it's rhetorical was
 
04:29:10.030 --> 04:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
that a result of the hypersexualization
 
04:29:13.309 --> 04:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
of things in schools all of a sudden
 
04:29:15.309 --> 04:29:15.319 align:start position:0%
this is an issue for kids to deal with
 
04:29:18.349 --> 04:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
uh I might even be well I think we're
 
04:29:21.290 --> 04:29:21.300 align:start position:0%
all at about the same age with you folks
 
04:29:23.630 --> 04:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
so when we were in high school this
 
04:29:25.790 --> 04:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't really discussed much it wasn't
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
an issue I'm sure that there were
 
04:29:31.429 --> 04:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
children youths who had uh questions
 
04:29:34.610 --> 04:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
about their identity who were unsure
 
04:29:36.830 --> 04:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
about where they were going in fact I
 
04:29:38.450 --> 04:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
bet all of us
 
04:29:40.189 --> 04:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
I I couldn't figure out how to get a
 
04:29:41.990 --> 04:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
date until 11th grade so I mean we're
 
04:29:44.809 --> 04:29:44.819 align:start position:0%
all trying to figure out things okay so
 
04:29:47.510 --> 04:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's a big piece of this suicide has
 
04:29:49.610 --> 04:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
gone through the roof everybody here
 
04:29:52.550 --> 04:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
wants to see suicide go down I do I lost
 
04:29:54.950 --> 04:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
a friend in high school to high school
 
04:29:57.469 --> 04:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
I'm also a military vet that served for
 
04:29:59.330 --> 04:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
32 years I've had some friends kill
 
04:30:01.729 --> 04:30:01.739 align:start position:0%
themselves from that too so I don't like
 
04:30:04.849 --> 04:30:04.859 align:start position:0%
suicide and I can speak about driving
 
04:30:06.889 --> 04:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
people not on the phone uh ma'am
 
04:30:09.530 --> 04:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
wherever she want but picking people up
 
04:30:11.450 --> 04:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
and saying get in the truck and going
 
04:30:12.769 --> 04:30:12.779 align:start position:0%
for a ride so they don't kill themselves
 
04:30:14.689 --> 04:30:14.699 align:start position:0%
so I know that this is a real thing and
 
04:30:16.670 --> 04:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
if anybody's experienced that or they
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
have a friend who's experienced it my
 
04:30:19.790 --> 04:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
heart goes out to you I'll be real quick
 
04:30:22.490 --> 04:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
this ought to pass because it's about
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
families taking care of the kids if you
 
04:30:27.229 --> 04:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
go to the page eight of this bill I
 
04:30:28.490 --> 04:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
could read it to you but you don't need
 
04:30:30.290 --> 04:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
me to do that you can read and you don't
 
04:30:31.550 --> 04:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
want to hear my voice anymore my
 
04:30:34.250 --> 04:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
horrible Charlestown Boston accent lines
 
04:30:37.130 --> 04:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
one through 16. please look at those
 
04:30:41.210 --> 04:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
and then lines 22 to 30. if you would
 
04:30:43.490 --> 04:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
consider those this bill has value and
 
04:30:44.990 --> 04:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
maybe it's just a discussion maybe it's
 
04:30:46.969 --> 04:30:46.979 align:start position:0%
just the beginning but I think it's an
 
04:30:49.070 --> 04:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
important discussion because there are
 
04:30:51.649 --> 04:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
kids who are not
 
04:30:54.830 --> 04:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
affected in the way other kids are that
 
04:30:56.630 --> 04:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
are being excluded from the conversation
 
04:31:00.410 --> 04:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm talking about non-gay non
 
04:31:03.590 --> 04:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
LGB kids they need to be respected as
 
04:31:05.630 --> 04:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
well that's what this is about in my
 
04:31:07.189 --> 04:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
mind thank you
 
04:31:07.199 --> 04:31:09.769 align:start position:0%
mind thank you

grader and a trans girl from Pembroke
 
04:31:23.870 --> 04:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
this is who I am and no piece of paper
 
04:31:27.469 --> 04:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
either online or a written can change
 
04:31:27.479 --> 04:31:28.790 align:start position:0%
either online or a written can change
that

04:31:28.790 --> 04:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:31:33.950 --> 04:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
for hb10 and sb272 when lgbtq people
 
04:31:35.530 --> 04:31:35.540 align:start position:0%
come out to their parents Grand
 
04:31:37.729 --> 04:31:37.739 align:start position:0%
grandparents friends and all other
 
04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
people who they spend a lot of time
 
04:31:41.630 --> 04:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
around it should be when they decide to
 
04:31:44.570 --> 04:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
it's not okay for the school system to
 
04:31:46.429 --> 04:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
tell their parents when the students
 
04:31:48.290 --> 04:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
don't want them want to come out to them
 
04:31:50.750 --> 04:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
yet we are our own people and we have a
 
04:31:53.809 --> 04:31:53.819 align:start position:0%
right to tell them when we want to it
 
04:31:55.729 --> 04:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
could be in a year a month or even a
 
04:31:57.290 --> 04:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
couple years before some people feel
 
04:31:59.689 --> 04:31:59.699 align:start position:0%
like they are ready to come out vote no
 
04:32:03.050 --> 04:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
one hb10 and SB 272
 
04:32:07.969 --> 04:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
reach me 417 I object that to gender
 
04:32:09.910 --> 04:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
affirming care being called child abuse
 
04:32:12.889 --> 04:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
what do you think council's child abuse
 
04:32:15.469 --> 04:32:15.479 align:start position:0%
I am non-abuse child and I have been
 
04:32:17.030 --> 04:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
getting gender affirming care for a
 
04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
while now personally I feel like I'm
 
04:32:20.929 --> 04:32:20.939 align:start position:0%
being loved and supported by all my
 
04:32:23.649 --> 04:32:23.659 align:start position:0%
family members and my friends
 
04:32:26.929 --> 04:32:26.939 align:start position:0%
I cannot talk today it'd be child abuse
 
04:32:29.210 --> 04:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
if kids didn't have a way to be
 
04:32:31.550 --> 04:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
themselves without being in the abused
 
04:32:34.910 --> 04:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
child category it'd be child abuse if
 
04:32:37.370 --> 04:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
group if girls had to play on the boys
 
04:32:40.130 --> 04:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
team but because of having a so-called
 
04:32:44.210 --> 04:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
physical advantage over real girls
 
04:32:46.189 --> 04:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
it would be child abuse if girls are
 
04:32:47.750 --> 04:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
forced to go into the boys bathroom and
 
04:32:51.830 --> 04:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
boys locker room vote no in HP 417
 
04:32:55.849 --> 04:32:55.859 align:start position:0%
for HP 619 forcing trans people to wait
 
04:32:57.469 --> 04:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
until they are 18 years old to get
 
04:33:00.110 --> 04:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care is just wrong some
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
people need to get the treatment if that
 
04:33:04.310 --> 04:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
they feel are needed at the time they
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
are needed it stops people from like me
 
04:33:09.349 --> 04:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
working from working with my doctors at
 
04:33:11.689 --> 04:33:11.699 align:start position:0%
places like Dartmouth health and Boston
 
04:33:13.429 --> 04:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
Children's Hospital from making
 
04:33:15.590 --> 04:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
decisions with my parents doctors and
 
04:33:19.551 --> 04:33:19.561 align:start position:0%
parents about known HB is 619
 
04:33:23.269 --> 04:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
for each b368 protecting gender or
 
04:33:24.890 --> 04:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
firming care and provide versus the way
 
04:33:26.869 --> 04:33:26.879 align:start position:0%
to go I know I would feel a lot better
 
04:33:30.890 --> 04:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
if this were the law vote Yes nhb 368. I
 
04:33:33.051 --> 04:33:33.061 align:start position:0%
would like it if you all kept protecting
 
04:33:36.051 --> 04:33:36.061 align:start position:0%
lgbtq rights including mine thank you
 
04:33:37.789 --> 04:33:37.799 align:start position:0%

about that in New Hampshire
 
04:35:52.131 --> 04:35:52.141 align:start position:0%
and a few years ago when questions arise
 
04:35:54.349 --> 04:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
about rights to discriminate
 
04:35:56.631 --> 04:35:56.641 align:start position:0%
what do we do in New Hampshire
 
04:36:00.949 --> 04:36:00.959 align:start position:0%
wise lawmakers like you
 
04:36:04.250 --> 04:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
we tighten and we strengthen New
 
04:36:08.869 --> 04:36:08.879 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's RSA 354 New Hampshire's law
 
04:36:11.410 --> 04:36:11.420 align:start position:0%
against discrimination
 
04:36:15.551 --> 04:36:15.561 align:start position:0%
finding in declaring quote
 
04:36:19.789 --> 04:36:19.799 align:start position:0%
practices of discrimination against any
 
04:36:22.789 --> 04:36:22.799 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's inhabitants because
 
04:36:28.070 --> 04:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
of age sex gender identity and a whole
 
04:36:30.529 --> 04:36:30.539 align:start position:0%
bunch of other important things
 
04:36:35.570 --> 04:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
are a matter of State concern
 
04:36:38.750 --> 04:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
such that such discrimination not only
 
04:36:41.330 --> 04:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
threatens the rights and proper
 
04:36:43.849 --> 04:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
privileges of its inhabitants
 
04:36:49.189 --> 04:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
but menaces the institutions and
 
04:36:52.390 --> 04:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
Foundation of a free
 
04:36:56.689 --> 04:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
Democratic State and threatens the peace
 
04:37:00.949 --> 04:37:00.959 align:start position:0%
order health safety and general welfare
 
04:37:03.830 --> 04:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire
 
04:37:06.289 --> 04:37:06.299 align:start position:0%
now those amazing words are already
 
04:37:09.949 --> 04:37:09.959 align:start position:0%
state law and what does that mean for me
 
04:37:12.730 --> 04:37:12.740 align:start position:0%
that means that when we as parents
 
04:37:16.209 --> 04:37:16.219 align:start position:0%
finally listened to our daughter
 
04:37:21.051 --> 04:37:21.061 align:start position:0%
three years after she asked Santa to be
 
04:37:24.170 --> 04:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
able to make her a girl starting at age
 
04:37:24.180 --> 04:37:25.369 align:start position:0%
able to make her a girl starting at age
three

04:37:25.369 --> 04:37:25.379 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:37:28.150 --> 04:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
that we can continue to listen to her
 
04:37:31.730 --> 04:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
now seven years later it means that she
 
04:37:35.631 --> 04:37:35.641 align:start position:0%
can continue to be her true teenage self
 
04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
voting itl on this bill means that when
 
04:37:42.109 --> 04:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
she plays Sports she can play on the
 
04:37:45.470 --> 04:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
girls team just like the other girls it
 
04:37:46.849 --> 04:37:46.859 align:start position:0%
means that when she goes to the bathroom
 
04:37:49.189 --> 04:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you she can go to the bathroom
 
04:37:52.250 --> 04:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
just like the other girls it means that
 
04:37:54.470 --> 04:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
when she receives her medical care from
 
04:37:56.689 --> 04:37:56.699 align:start position:0%
experts at Dartmouth and Boston
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
Children's not none of us not her not
 
04:38:03.470 --> 04:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
her health care providers and not her
 
04:38:06.849 --> 04:38:06.859 align:start position:0%
parents will be treated as child abusers
 
04:38:10.631 --> 04:38:10.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:14.029 --> 04:38:14.039 align:start position:0%
she will be proud to be from New
 
04:38:17.810 --> 04:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because New Hampshire is no
 
04:38:19.910 --> 04:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
home for hate
 
04:38:23.810 --> 04:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for voting itl on 619. thank
 
04:38:25.730 --> 04:38:25.740 align:start position:0%

we still have 34 Mark more cards to go
 
04:38:37.250 --> 04:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
and we have our other bill as well we're
 
04:38:38.929 --> 04:38:38.939 align:start position:0%
going to see how many we can do by three
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
o'clock then we'll recess this in order
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%

04:38:46.131 --> 04:38:46.141 align:start position:0%
is House Bill 368 and then pick this up
 
04:38:48.289 --> 04:38:48.299 align:start position:0%
again right at the end so that we can
 
04:38:49.910 --> 04:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
continue to hear everybody but also
 
04:38:51.890 --> 04:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
respect everybody's time so with that
 
04:38:56.269 --> 04:38:56.279 align:start position:0%

um I hear
 
04:38:59.330 --> 04:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
04:39:05.990 --> 04:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
and people feeling like they are being
 
04:39:06.000 --> 04:39:07.789 align:start position:0%
and people feeling like they are being
um

04:39:07.789 --> 04:39:07.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:10.070 --> 04:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
second-class citizens but I'm here to
 
04:39:13.551 --> 04:39:13.561 align:start position:0%
talk about the medical side of things
 
04:39:15.709 --> 04:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
um most looking around the room here
 
04:39:17.390 --> 04:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
you're all some of you are not old
 
04:39:19.131 --> 04:39:19.141 align:start position:0%
enough to realize that there was a draw
 
04:39:22.609 --> 04:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
down the market thalidomide that was
 
04:39:24.170 --> 04:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
given to pregnant women for morning
 
04:39:27.650 --> 04:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
sickness and every doctor gave it said
 
04:39:29.449 --> 04:39:29.459 align:start position:0%
hey this is the miracle drug this is
 
04:39:30.709 --> 04:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
going to fix everything you're not going
 
04:39:33.590 --> 04:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
to have morning sickness until hundreds
 
04:39:37.610 --> 04:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
of thousands of babies were born with
 
04:39:42.410 --> 04:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
defected limbs all over the world this
 
04:39:44.510 --> 04:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
was not just in the United States it was
 
04:39:47.150 --> 04:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
all over the world and it took
 
04:39:50.390 --> 04:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
legislative action to stop the use of
 
04:39:53.930 --> 04:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
this drug and to install safeguards as
 
04:39:57.430 --> 04:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
to whether drugs can and cannot be
 
04:40:00.170 --> 04:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
approved appropriately and how they were
 
04:40:02.810 --> 04:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
done that still did not stop another
 
04:40:04.850 --> 04:40:04.860 align:start position:0%
drug from being put on the market called
 
04:40:06.948 --> 04:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
des and I am not going to pronounce the
 
04:40:09.410 --> 04:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
name for it and again this was an
 
04:40:12.530 --> 04:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
estrogen drug that was promoted to women
 
04:40:16.190 --> 04:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
saying hey you're not having you're
 
04:40:19.490 --> 04:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
having miscarriages you're unable to get
 
04:40:21.770 --> 04:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
pregnant we are going to give you this
 
04:40:21.780 --> 04:40:23.810 align:start position:0%
pregnant we are going to give you this
drug

04:40:23.810 --> 04:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
drug
 
04:40:26.570 --> 04:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
the ramifications from this drug are
 
04:40:28.430 --> 04:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
still being felt today
 
04:40:32.090 --> 04:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
the women that took it most of them had
 
04:40:34.130 --> 04:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
cancer of some sort later on their life
 
04:40:36.288 --> 04:40:36.298 align:start position:0%
and died at an early age
 
04:40:38.090 --> 04:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
their children
 
04:40:40.490 --> 04:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
are now saying are seeing the effects of
 
04:40:43.630 --> 04:40:43.640 align:start position:0%
it they're called Des sons and daughters
 
04:40:47.810 --> 04:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
and the side effects to the women are
 
04:40:53.270 --> 04:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
infertility and other other fertility
 
04:40:56.750 --> 04:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
issues and um and the men along too with
 
04:41:00.170 --> 04:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
having different types of cancers and it
 
04:41:02.990 --> 04:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
has now been the grandchildren
 
04:41:08.030 --> 04:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
so this drug that was stopped in 1970 is
 
04:41:11.270 --> 04:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
still affecting people today the
 
04:41:13.850 --> 04:41:13.860 align:start position:0%
grandchildren are seeing the effects of
 
04:41:17.270 --> 04:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
this drug so when a doctor or a medical
 
04:41:20.390 --> 04:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
profession or a group of them say oh we
 
04:41:22.910 --> 04:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
think this is safe all of those drugs
 
04:41:25.610 --> 04:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
were said to be safe and effective and
 
04:41:27.230 --> 04:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
they were going to solve your problem
 
04:41:29.150 --> 04:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
they did not
 
04:41:32.690 --> 04:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
and I would also like to say that in
 
04:41:34.310 --> 04:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
this state and I have and I would hope
 
04:41:36.288 --> 04:41:36.298 align:start position:0%
somebody else could even do more
 
04:41:37.910 --> 04:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
research than I could I could not find
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
it this law has been repealed or not but
 
04:41:43.788 --> 04:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
in 1917 in order to get out of a mental
 
04:41:46.490 --> 04:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
institution you had to be sterilized and
 
04:41:48.288 --> 04:41:48.298 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire they sterilized over
 
04:41:50.810 --> 04:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
almost close to a thousand people male
 
04:41:52.310 --> 04:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
and female
 
04:41:56.330 --> 04:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:00.170 --> 04:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
so just because we can do it doesn't
 
04:42:02.810 --> 04:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
mean we should thank you thank you very
 
04:42:04.550 --> 04:42:04.560 align:start position:0%

advocate was here we would have tried to
 
04:42:24.830 --> 04:42:24.840 align:start position:0%

I'm here to testify in the opposition to
 
04:43:06.288 --> 04:43:06.298 align:start position:0%
house bill 619.
 
04:43:08.510 --> 04:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
this bill directly contradicts the US
 
04:43:11.330 --> 04:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
Department of education's guidelines for
 
04:43:14.030 --> 04:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
supporting transgender youth in school
 
04:43:16.750 --> 04:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
it ties pronouns to the gender binary
 
04:43:20.208 --> 04:43:20.218 align:start position:0%
based on a person's assigned sex at
 
04:43:22.788 --> 04:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
Birth and disregards gender neutral
 
04:43:25.368 --> 04:43:25.378 align:start position:0%
neutral options like they them all
 
04:43:25.378 --> 04:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
neutral options like they them all
together

04:43:26.000 --> 04:43:26.010 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:43:26.010 --> 04:43:28.070 align:start position:0%
together

however I was not mad
 
04:43:46.490 --> 04:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
I figured it was a simple typographical
 
04:43:46.500 --> 04:43:49.070 align:start position:0%
I figured it was a simple typographical
error

04:43:49.070 --> 04:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
error
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
while I wasn't mad
 
04:43:53.930 --> 04:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
reading that word over and over again
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
made me feel deep down inside
 
04:44:00.650 --> 04:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
again I'm not here my pronouns are she
 
04:44:00.660 --> 04:44:02.330 align:start position:0%
again I'm not here my pronouns are she
her

04:44:02.330 --> 04:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
her
 
04:44:05.150 --> 04:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
as a cisgender person I will never truly
 
04:44:06.910 --> 04:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
know what it feels like to be
 
04:44:09.770 --> 04:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
intentionally misgendered
 
04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
but that letter gave me just the tiniest
 
04:44:15.590 --> 04:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
taste of what transgender people go
 
04:44:15.600 --> 04:44:18.170 align:start position:0%
taste of what transgender people go
through

04:44:18.170 --> 04:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:21.410 --> 04:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
so now I asked you all how would it feel
 
04:44:25.150 --> 04:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
if you were intentionally misgendered
 
04:44:27.650 --> 04:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
every day
 
04:44:30.350 --> 04:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
would you feel welcomed would you feel
 
04:44:34.070 --> 04:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
light would you feel respected
 
04:44:37.368 --> 04:44:37.378 align:start position:0%
if your pronouns are he him and I called
 
04:44:40.490 --> 04:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
you she her on purpose
 
04:44:44.750 --> 04:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
would you feel respected
 
04:44:47.570 --> 04:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
if your pronouns are she her and I
 
04:44:50.510 --> 04:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
called you he him as a cisgender person
 
04:44:53.270 --> 04:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
would you feel respected would you feel
 
04:44:53.280 --> 04:44:55.310 align:start position:0%
would you feel respected would you feel
light

04:44:55.310 --> 04:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
light
 
04:44:58.730 --> 04:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
now imagine yourself back in
 
04:45:01.970 --> 04:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
School especially middle school and high
 
04:45:01.980 --> 04:45:03.288 align:start position:0%
School especially middle school and high
school

04:45:03.288 --> 04:45:03.298 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:45:05.990 --> 04:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
between anxiety
 
04:45:09.050 --> 04:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
and having to go into from those
 
04:45:12.230 --> 04:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
Elementary School years to those older
 
04:45:15.530 --> 04:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
years those are very awkward years for
 
04:45:18.830 --> 04:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
many many children no matter how they
 
04:45:18.840 --> 04:45:20.208 align:start position:0%
many many children no matter how they
identify

04:45:20.208 --> 04:45:20.218 align:start position:0%
identify
 
04:45:22.730 --> 04:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
don't we want them to feel welcome at
 
04:45:22.740 --> 04:45:24.230 align:start position:0%
don't we want them to feel welcome at
school

04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:45:26.690 --> 04:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
I have a family member who's in high
 
04:45:29.030 --> 04:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
school and is transgender
 
04:45:31.430 --> 04:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
they use they them pronouns
 
04:45:34.010 --> 04:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes they would be
 
04:45:37.310 --> 04:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
misgendered every single day until they
 
04:45:39.948 --> 04:45:39.958 align:start position:0%
graduate or until the bill is repealed
 
04:45:44.930 --> 04:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
so I asked you again how would you feel
 
04:45:48.110 --> 04:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:51.830 --> 04:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
to decide against this and vote itl on
 
04:45:54.590 --> 04:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill 619 because children are
 
04:45:57.410 --> 04:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
people too who deserve basic respect
 
04:46:01.070 --> 04:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
just like us adults
 
04:46:04.190 --> 04:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time I do
 
04:46:06.708 --> 04:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
not wish to answer questions as pronouns
 
04:46:09.410 --> 04:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
are not up for debate with me because
 
04:46:12.650 --> 04:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
they are a matter of basic respect in my
 
04:46:15.530 --> 04:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
eyes thank you for your testimony
 
04:46:20.448 --> 04:46:20.458 align:start position:0%

express hours our strong opposition to
 
04:47:11.090 --> 04:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
this bill in its entirety however I will
 
04:47:12.770 --> 04:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
focus specifically on the section of the
 
04:47:15.050 --> 04:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
bill that removes all protections from
 
04:47:17.270 --> 04:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
so-called conversion therapy
 
04:47:19.670 --> 04:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
our team has worked to protect lgbtq
 
04:47:21.288 --> 04:47:21.298 align:start position:0%
youth by supporting legislation
 
04:47:23.390 --> 04:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
protecting those youth from conversion
 
04:47:27.250 --> 04:47:27.260 align:start position:0%
therapy thus far 20 U.S states and over
 
04:47:30.170 --> 04:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
120 cities and municipalities have
 
04:47:32.330 --> 04:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
passed such legislation to protect lgbtq
 
04:47:32.340 --> 04:47:34.310 align:start position:0%
passed such legislation to protect lgbtq
minors

04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
minors
 
04:47:36.470 --> 04:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
each of these laws have passed with
 
04:47:39.050 --> 04:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support out of the 20 States
 
04:47:41.150 --> 04:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
eight Republican Governors have signed
 
04:47:43.070 --> 04:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
the passage of these laws and almost 50
 
04:47:45.550 --> 04:47:45.560 align:start position:0%

04:47:48.050 --> 04:47:48.060 align:start position:0%

governor sununu
 
04:47:52.368 --> 04:47:52.378 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire passed a ban on conversion
 
04:47:55.070 --> 04:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
therapy to codify an already understood
 
04:47:57.288 --> 04:47:57.298 align:start position:0%
issue with extraordinary amounts of
 
04:47:59.690 --> 04:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
evidence that any attempts of conversion
 
04:48:02.570 --> 04:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
therapy is harmful fraudulent and may
 
04:48:04.430 --> 04:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
cause a lifelong damage and potential
 
04:48:04.440 --> 04:48:05.990 align:start position:0%
cause a lifelong damage and potential
suicide

04:48:05.990 --> 04:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
04:48:08.150 --> 04:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
personally I am one of seven hundred
 
04:48:09.470 --> 04:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
thousand people living in the United
 
04:48:10.850 --> 04:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
States today that have experienced
 
04:48:12.890 --> 04:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy that number is as
 
04:48:15.470 --> 04:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
reported by the UCLA Williams Institute
 
04:48:17.448 --> 04:48:17.458 align:start position:0%
my personal experience in conversion
 
04:48:19.670 --> 04:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
therapy unfortunately aligns with the
 
04:48:22.190 --> 04:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
many harms reported by mental by the
 
04:48:23.330 --> 04:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
national mental health and medical
 
04:48:23.340 --> 04:48:25.010 align:start position:0%
national mental health and medical
associations

04:48:25.010 --> 04:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
associations
 
04:48:27.050 --> 04:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
I was in conversion therapy for five
 
04:48:30.708 --> 04:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
years from ages 16 through 21. each of
 
04:48:33.170 --> 04:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
my therapists was a licensed
 
04:48:33.180 --> 04:48:34.190 align:start position:0%
my therapists was a licensed
professional

04:48:34.190 --> 04:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
professional
 
04:48:36.170 --> 04:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
when I came out to my father my father
 
04:48:38.030 --> 04:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
made it clear how much he loved me that
 
04:48:40.070 --> 04:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
I had nothing to fear yet my father
 
04:48:41.510 --> 04:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
began to search for a therapist to
 
04:48:43.070 --> 04:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
understand what my coming out May mean
 
04:48:45.110 --> 04:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
for myself and for my family
 
04:48:46.970 --> 04:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
in meeting with a licensed professional
 
04:48:49.070 --> 04:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
again this is how the bill currently
 
04:48:51.170 --> 04:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
exists in New Hampshire my father was
 
04:48:52.910 --> 04:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
told that being gay was nothing more
 
04:48:55.250 --> 04:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
than a mental illness that same-sex
 
04:48:58.070 --> 04:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
attraction can be cured and that all
 
04:49:01.310 --> 04:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
people are innately heterosexual
 
04:49:03.050 --> 04:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
the therapist that further explained
 
04:49:04.670 --> 04:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
that childhood traumas were the cause of
 
04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
me being LG of myself being gay but
 
04:49:09.470 --> 04:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
further for the entire lgbtq community
 
04:49:11.628 --> 04:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
and that if I went to therapy and healed
 
04:49:13.610 --> 04:49:13.620 align:start position:0%
those childhood traumas my same-sex
 
04:49:15.830 --> 04:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
attraction would disappear
 
04:49:17.990 --> 04:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
for my father this was a Lifeline moment
 
04:49:20.150 --> 04:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
that he felt that he could possibly give
 
04:49:22.128 --> 04:49:22.138 align:start position:0%
me a different outcome instead of being
 
04:49:22.138 --> 04:49:23.990 align:start position:0%
me a different outcome instead of being
gay

04:49:23.990 --> 04:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
gay
 
04:49:25.850 --> 04:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
luckily for me I didn't have any
 
04:49:27.410 --> 04:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
significant childhood traumas which
 
04:49:32.570 --> 04:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:32.580 --> 04:49:34.490 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

04:49:34.490 --> 04:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:49:36.590 --> 04:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
um supposedly the therapist that I was
 
04:49:38.628 --> 04:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
working with and state and so their
 
04:49:40.310 --> 04:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
diagnosis stated that I was too close to
 
04:49:42.288 --> 04:49:42.298 align:start position:0%
my mother and my two sisters and not
 
04:49:44.570 --> 04:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
close enough to my father my first
 
04:49:46.070 --> 04:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
treatment required that I did not speak
 
04:49:47.690 --> 04:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
to my mother and two sisters which
 
04:49:49.310 --> 04:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
lasted three years
 
04:49:51.110 --> 04:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
I was told this would ensure that I
 
04:49:52.368 --> 04:49:52.378 align:start position:0%
would not pick up any effeminate
 
04:49:55.070 --> 04:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
behaviors I would not see women or the
 
04:49:57.530 --> 04:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
girls at school as my peers and that to
 
04:50:00.350 --> 04:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
learn that men are my peers while I
 
04:50:01.910 --> 04:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
truly believed conversion therapy was
 
04:50:03.708 --> 04:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
working I became depressed and suicidal
 
04:50:05.690 --> 04:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
in year two out of five
 
04:50:07.070 --> 04:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
one of my therapists believed I was
 
04:50:08.570 --> 04:50:08.580 align:start position:0%
ready to engage with women sexually I
 
04:50:11.150 --> 04:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
was instructed to use step by step I was
 
04:50:12.590 --> 04:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
instructed step by step how to engage
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
with women in my environment despite if
 
04:50:17.030 --> 04:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
I led to believe our attractions were
 
04:50:19.730 --> 04:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
loved maybe real or not I suffered
 
04:50:21.650 --> 04:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
extreme anxiety around that and I was
 
04:50:23.930 --> 04:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
not able to sexually perform
 
04:50:26.208 --> 04:50:26.218 align:start position:0%
in this moment my therapist prescribed
 
04:50:29.510 --> 04:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
described me Viagra through my father in
 
04:50:31.430 --> 04:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
order to boost my confidence as a young
 
04:50:33.708 --> 04:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
man I did not suffer from erectile
 
04:50:35.330 --> 04:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
dysfunction I was just I was a healthy
 
04:50:37.550 --> 04:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
young 17 year old boy
 
04:50:39.410 --> 04:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
during those five years my parents spent
 
04:50:41.150 --> 04:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
a total of thirty five thousand dollars
 
04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
on my conversion therapy I dropped out
 
04:50:45.470 --> 04:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
of college due to my depression anxiety
 
04:50:48.368 --> 04:50:48.378 align:start position:0%
the entire ordeal was artificial
 
04:50:51.110 --> 04:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
humiliating and demeaning
 
04:50:53.208 --> 04:50:53.218 align:start position:0%
every licensed therapist knows or should
 
04:50:55.128 --> 04:50:55.138 align:start position:0%
know this is a dangerous and fraudulent
 
04:50:57.410 --> 04:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
practice anyone who carries a license in
 
04:50:58.788 --> 04:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire New Hampshire
 
04:51:00.590 --> 04:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
knows that their educational curriculum
 
04:51:02.270 --> 04:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
those requirements obtain a state
 
04:51:04.910 --> 04:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
license that conversion therapy has no
 
04:51:07.070 --> 04:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
significant backing
 
04:51:08.510 --> 04:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you if you could come to the
 
04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
conclusion thank you yes
 
04:51:13.190 --> 04:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
this is a law that already exists in New
 
04:51:15.650 --> 04:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by repealing the law as it is
 
04:51:17.810 --> 04:51:17.820 align:start position:0%
stated you will be allowing
 
04:51:19.610 --> 04:51:19.620 align:start position:0%
therapists who are licensed by the state
 
04:51:21.230 --> 04:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
the state's responsibility to protect
 
04:51:22.368 --> 04:51:22.378 align:start position:0%
the youth
 
04:51:24.590 --> 04:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
um to protect practice
 
04:51:26.270 --> 04:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
one is something that is extremely
 
04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
dangerous and too fraudulently make
 
04:51:29.628 --> 04:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
money off of those profits thank you for
 
04:51:31.250 --> 04:51:31.260 align:start position:0%

seeing none so Heather millins

and we have Russ Ann Chester
 
04:51:43.310 --> 04:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:47.930 --> 04:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:50.150 --> 04:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Russian Chester I'm
 
04:51:53.448 --> 04:51:53.458 align:start position:0%
from Bedford New Hampshire I have been I
 
04:51:57.288 --> 04:51:57.298 align:start position:0%
was born in 1960 in the state at nine
 
04:52:00.350 --> 04:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
years old I started to develop I was not
 
04:52:02.150 --> 04:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it and I used to bind
 
04:52:05.150 --> 04:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
myself because I wasn't comfortable with
 
04:52:07.670 --> 04:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
developing so young
 
04:52:07.680 --> 04:52:08.330 align:start position:0%
developing so young
um

04:52:08.330 --> 04:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:12.650 --> 04:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
had I had the opportunity to participate
 
04:52:15.770 --> 04:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
in hormone therapy I may have I don't
 
04:52:15.780 --> 04:52:17.690 align:start position:0%
in hormone therapy I may have I don't
know

04:52:17.690 --> 04:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:52:21.650 --> 04:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
um but I can say that I am proud that my
 
04:52:25.070 --> 04:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
name is Russian and occasionally I get
 
04:52:27.350 --> 04:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
misidentified as mister
 
04:52:29.810 --> 04:52:29.820 align:start position:0%
I don't have a problem with that I don't
 
04:52:34.128 --> 04:52:34.138 align:start position:0%
identify by what I look like or a label
 
04:52:37.910 --> 04:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
I want to say I am truly appalled and
 
04:52:40.430 --> 04:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
saddened that our state has gotten to
 
04:52:42.170 --> 04:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
the point that we are identified by
 
04:52:44.570 --> 04:52:44.580 align:start position:0%
labels that's the one thing about New
 
04:52:47.390 --> 04:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that never existed we didn't
 
04:52:51.170 --> 04:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
used to identify as he she they or they
 
04:52:54.230 --> 04:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
them their or whatever furries we didn't
 
04:52:57.410 --> 04:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
identify we identified as humans
 
04:52:59.810 --> 04:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
the queer theory that took place that
 
04:53:01.730 --> 04:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
someone mentioned I actually grew up
 
04:53:05.150 --> 04:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
during that time and I struggled
 
04:53:07.430 --> 04:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is the queer theory is
 
04:53:09.350 --> 04:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
about dehumanization
 
04:53:12.410 --> 04:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
and dehumanization is exactly what is
 
04:53:15.530 --> 04:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
happening to all of our lgbtq community
 
04:53:18.230 --> 04:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
folks tapping to the to the CIS
 
04:53:22.190 --> 04:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
Community folks it's dehumanization this
 
04:53:24.948 --> 04:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
bill has absolutely nothing to do with
 
04:53:28.368 --> 04:53:28.378 align:start position:0%
hate it has nothing to do with trying to
 
04:53:32.270 --> 04:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
take away parentals rights or faith it
 
04:53:35.868 --> 04:53:35.878 align:start position:0%
has to do with schools who are set in
 
04:53:40.490 --> 04:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
place to teach our children education
 
04:53:43.150 --> 04:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
not to be involved with the
 
04:53:46.430 --> 04:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
socio-emotional learning aspects the
 
04:53:49.250 --> 04:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
bottom line is schools have our children
 
04:53:54.410 --> 04:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:57.230 --> 04:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
outside the school system they are have
 
04:54:01.850 --> 04:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
they have 165 to 128 hours a week that
 
04:54:04.550 --> 04:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
is not in the school system
 
04:54:07.190 --> 04:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
I was a child advocate I was an advocate
 
04:54:09.830 --> 04:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
for child abuse victims
 
04:54:09.840 --> 04:54:11.330 align:start position:0%
for child abuse victims
I

04:54:11.330 --> 04:54:11.340 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:54:14.628 --> 04:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
hold myself partially responsible
 
04:54:16.490 --> 04:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
for a girl
 
04:54:19.490 --> 04:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
that I helped
 
04:54:23.390 --> 04:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
transition because she she really told
 
04:54:26.510 --> 04:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
me that that's what she wanted I helped
 
04:54:28.788 --> 04:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
her find the resources out in our
 
04:54:28.798 --> 04:54:31.010 align:start position:0%
her find the resources out in our
community

04:54:31.010 --> 04:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:33.650 --> 04:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
I was the one that got her suicide note
 
04:54:36.170 --> 04:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
because she wanted to de-transition
 
04:54:39.288 --> 04:54:39.298 align:start position:0%
after the fact and the lgbtq community
 
04:54:42.770 --> 04:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
was not accepting
 
04:54:47.208 --> 04:54:47.218 align:start position:0%
so we talk about love and hate the
 
04:54:50.390 --> 04:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
bottom line is is that love and hate is
 
04:54:54.430 --> 04:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:54.440 --> 04:54:56.270 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

04:54:56.270 --> 04:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
04:55:01.010 --> 04:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
but don't stand on your faith and say I
 
04:55:04.190 --> 04:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
love you so therefore as long as you
 
04:55:06.830 --> 04:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
think like I do I'll support you
 
04:55:09.410 --> 04:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
that's what the LGBT community is doing
 
04:55:13.250 --> 04:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
to our our gay population and our truly
 
04:55:17.510 --> 04:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
transgender population and it's not okay
 
04:55:19.250 --> 04:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm willing to take any questions
 
04:55:21.350 --> 04:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
04:55:24.948 --> 04:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
any questions no singing on thank you do
 
04:55:27.410 --> 04:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
we have Lee Hollis here fantastic
 
04:55:36.050 --> 04:55:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
howdy uh and thank you very much for
 
04:55:43.070 --> 04:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
staying you're probably starving because
 
04:55:45.890 --> 04:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:49.550 --> 04:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh I wanted to try and touch on a couple
 
04:55:52.730 --> 04:55:52.740 align:start position:0%
of the uh a couple of the things that
 
04:55:55.610 --> 04:55:55.620 align:start position:0%
have been mentioned previously by other
 
04:55:57.410 --> 04:55:57.420 align:start position:0%
testimony as well as some things that
 
04:55:59.030 --> 04:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
hadn't um
 
04:56:01.368 --> 04:56:01.378 align:start position:0%
that I haven't really seen come up too
 
04:56:04.070 --> 04:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
much my name is Lee I was born and
 
04:56:06.890 --> 04:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
raised in New Hampshire I am non-binary
 
04:56:10.550 --> 04:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
and my trans partner couldn't be here
 
04:56:13.610 --> 04:56:13.620 align:start position:0%
because disabled people have more
 
04:56:16.910 --> 04:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
difficulty getting to speak in person
 
04:56:21.110 --> 04:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
at events like this because of you know
 
04:56:24.590 --> 04:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
being disabled so I also appreciate the
 
04:56:26.750 --> 04:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
fact that we were able to submit online
 
04:56:28.970 --> 04:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
testimony that's something that I didn't
 
04:56:30.410 --> 04:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
know we could do and I think that's
 
04:56:32.890 --> 04:56:32.900 align:start position:0%
great so
 
04:56:37.128 --> 04:56:37.138 align:start position:0%
uh one bit of the first page that I
 
04:56:41.570 --> 04:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out is that it marks um
 
04:56:45.288 --> 04:56:45.298 align:start position:0%
it says that suicide rates and mortality
 
04:56:48.948 --> 04:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
rates are elevated even in uh even in
 
04:56:51.650 --> 04:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
trans people who have received gender
 
04:56:54.590 --> 04:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
affirming care mortality rates also
 
04:56:57.070 --> 04:56:57.080 align:start position:0%
include homicide
 
04:57:00.470 --> 04:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
and homicide of transgender individuals
 
04:57:03.410 --> 04:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
has increased by 400 percent
 
04:57:07.208 --> 04:57:07.218 align:start position:0%
in the last I think five years
 
04:57:10.550 --> 04:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh so yeah our modern our mortality
 
04:57:13.730 --> 04:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
rates are increasing actually but it's
 
04:57:16.310 --> 04:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
because we're being murdered
 
04:57:19.448 --> 04:57:19.458 align:start position:0%
um and as for
 
04:57:22.490 --> 04:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
increased suicide rates
 
04:57:24.890 --> 04:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
other populations that have Market fee
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
increased suicide rates especially in
 
04:57:29.350 --> 04:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
adolescents are women
 
04:57:34.190 --> 04:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
and gay people and disabled people and
 
04:57:36.230 --> 04:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
we've already done the song and dance
 
04:57:40.070 --> 04:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
about protecting gay people and women
 
04:57:43.250 --> 04:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
and disabled people hopefully we can do
 
04:57:46.670 --> 04:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
more for all of those groups in the
 
04:57:48.530 --> 04:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
future but
 
04:57:48.540 --> 04:57:51.770 align:start position:0%
future but
I

04:57:51.770 --> 04:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:55.610 --> 04:57:55.620 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine a world
 
04:57:58.030 --> 04:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
I don't want to imagine a New Hampshire
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:58:03.788 --> 04:58:03.798 align:start position:0%
so in everybody's business
 
04:58:06.170 --> 04:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
that they
 
04:58:08.330 --> 04:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
think that it's appropriate to get
 
04:58:08.340 --> 04:58:11.030 align:start position:0%
think that it's appropriate to get
between

04:58:11.030 --> 04:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:58:15.708 --> 04:58:15.718 align:start position:0%
families and their doctors and
 
04:58:19.250 --> 04:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
especially like
 
04:58:19.260 --> 04:58:21.650 align:start position:0%
especially like
sorry

04:58:21.650 --> 04:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:58:23.150 --> 04:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank you you're doing great if you can
 
04:58:25.190 --> 04:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
give us a conclusion it's right in that
 
04:58:27.170 --> 04:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
time so thank you yeah
 
04:58:30.670 --> 04:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:32.930 --> 04:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
the primary thing that I want to point
 
04:58:37.010 --> 04:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
out is that the majority of the people
 
04:58:40.128 --> 04:58:40.138 align:start position:0%
who spoke in support of this bill even
 
04:58:43.128 --> 04:58:43.138 align:start position:0%
they didn't support all of it the
 
04:58:46.550 --> 04:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
majority of them were saying that they
 
04:58:49.128 --> 04:58:49.138 align:start position:0%
support psychological treatment to
 
04:58:51.650 --> 04:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
gender affirmation in schools
 
04:58:55.250 --> 04:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
and the only person that that I saw who
 
04:58:57.410 --> 04:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
like was gung-ho about the whole thing
 
04:58:59.448 --> 04:58:59.458 align:start position:0%
was the guy who came in and compared it
 
04:59:01.730 --> 04:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
to Nazi Eugenics and I don't think we
 
04:59:03.410 --> 04:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
want to listen to that guy because he
 
04:59:03.420 --> 04:59:05.030 align:start position:0%
want to listen to that guy because he
was

04:59:05.030 --> 04:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:59:06.770 --> 04:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
like if you keep it to the topic and not
 
04:59:08.930 --> 04:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
to people then thank you very much we've
 
04:59:10.430 --> 04:59:10.440 align:start position:0%

Education ignorance fear and Terror
 
05:01:19.250 --> 05:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
this bill would be detrimental to young
 
05:01:21.288 --> 05:01:21.298 align:start position:0%
children children who are confused and
 
05:01:23.628 --> 05:01:23.638 align:start position:0%

um

05:05:59.030 --> 05:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:02.390 --> 05:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
I'll just cover it by the the titles of
 
05:06:05.868 --> 05:06:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:05.878 --> 05:06:08.570 align:start position:0%
 
the

05:06:08.570 --> 05:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:06:08.580 --> 05:06:09.890 align:start position:0%
the
chapter

05:06:09.890 --> 05:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
05:06:13.510 --> 05:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
354 C2 is essentially
 
05:06:17.990 --> 05:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
that foreign subpoenas are prohibited
 
05:06:20.628 --> 05:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
and this essentially that will
 
05:06:20.638 --> 05:06:22.250 align:start position:0%
and this essentially that will
um

05:06:22.250 --> 05:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:24.788 --> 05:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
we we won't acknowledge those
 
05:06:28.190 --> 05:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
essentially if someone asks for that
 
05:06:31.190 --> 05:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
information it will stay here
 
05:06:33.770 --> 05:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
05:06:35.930 --> 05:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
very much
 
05:06:39.530 --> 05:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
akin to hippo rights
 
05:06:42.110 --> 05:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
is that Medical Care is not released
 
05:06:45.830 --> 05:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
unless somebody authorizes it
 
05:06:49.690 --> 05:06:49.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:53.270 --> 05:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
encoding this in our statutes
 
05:06:55.190 --> 05:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
to let people know the same thing that
 
05:06:58.670 --> 05:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
happened only only the people that are
 
05:07:01.190 --> 05:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
responsible for the health care of a
 
05:07:01.200 --> 05:07:02.150 align:start position:0%
responsible for the health care of a
child

05:07:02.150 --> 05:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
child
 
05:07:06.050 --> 05:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
or themselves will have authorization to
 
05:07:10.010 --> 05:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:12.550 --> 05:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
and that leads to the next paragraph
 
05:07:14.868 --> 05:07:14.878 align:start position:0%
354 C3
 
05:07:16.490 --> 05:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
which is parental rights and
 
05:07:16.500 --> 05:07:18.170 align:start position:0%
which is parental rights and
responsibility

05:07:18.170 --> 05:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
05:07:20.810 --> 05:07:20.820 align:start position:0%
essentially when a parent arrives here
 
05:07:25.250 --> 05:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:28.730 --> 05:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
they will be
 
05:07:33.830 --> 05:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to get the health care they need
 
05:07:36.650 --> 05:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
without having to share that information
 
05:07:41.510 --> 05:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:46.090 --> 05:07:46.100 align:start position:0%
I am not really familiar with the term
 
05:07:49.690 --> 05:07:49.700 align:start position:0%
inconvenient forum
 
05:07:52.670 --> 05:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
I can see my lawyer friend laughing
 
05:07:55.730 --> 05:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
circling but
 
05:07:55.740 --> 05:07:59.810 align:start position:0%
circling but
um

05:07:59.810 --> 05:07:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:03.288 --> 05:08:03.298 align:start position:0%
the courts our courts will decide
 
05:08:05.590 --> 05:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
whether this is something they need to
 
05:08:08.628 --> 05:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
take action on
 
05:08:08.638 --> 05:08:10.070 align:start position:0%
take action on
the

05:08:10.070 --> 05:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:08:15.708 --> 05:08:15.718 align:start position:0%
in c54 3 C5 the domestic violence is is
 
05:08:18.110 --> 05:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
actually a little more complex
 
05:08:20.930 --> 05:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
because the court is involved with that
 
05:08:23.868 --> 05:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
in in trying to make a decision based on
 
05:08:27.170 --> 05:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
the situation of the family on what is
 
05:08:27.180 --> 05:08:29.330 align:start position:0%
the situation of the family on what is
appropriate

05:08:29.330 --> 05:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:08:35.448 --> 05:08:35.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:38.990 --> 05:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
the same thing is is true with the
 
05:08:42.590 --> 05:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
in sections uh three three five four
 
05:08:46.010 --> 05:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
C colon six the removal of a child from
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
a parent or Guardian
 
05:08:50.570 --> 05:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
it comes down to was that removal lung
 
05:08:54.230 --> 05:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh was was done legally and so the
 
05:08:57.770 --> 05:08:57.780 align:start position:0%
parent that has that child here has has
 
05:09:04.850 --> 05:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:11.330 --> 05:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:13.730 --> 05:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
I'll just read the first paragraph it is
 
05:09:16.250 --> 05:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
in the public policy of this state that
 
05:09:18.470 --> 05:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
an out-of-state arrest warrant for an
 
05:09:20.930 --> 05:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
individual based on violating another
 
05:09:24.170 --> 05:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
State's law against providing receiving
 
05:09:26.448 --> 05:09:26.458 align:start position:0%
or allowing their child to receive
 
05:09:29.030 --> 05:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
gender affirming health care or gender
 
05:09:32.030 --> 05:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
affirming Mental Health Care is the
 
05:09:38.390 --> 05:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:40.730 --> 05:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
so in the paragraph it identifies three
 
05:09:40.740 --> 05:09:41.810 align:start position:0%
so in the paragraph it identifies three
areas

05:09:41.810 --> 05:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
areas
 
05:09:46.788 --> 05:09:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:46.798 --> 05:09:50.090 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:09:50.090 --> 05:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:54.650 --> 05:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:58.368 --> 05:09:58.378 align:start position:0%
we are letting people know is that
 
05:10:00.708 --> 05:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
we won't inform them
 
05:10:05.810 --> 05:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:08.690 --> 05:10:08.700 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
05:10:12.170 --> 05:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
to bring a person back to that state if
 
05:10:14.868 --> 05:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
it's associated with
 
05:10:16.850 --> 05:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
a child getting
 
05:10:21.230 --> 05:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:23.770 --> 05:10:23.780 align:start position:0%
in 354 cea
 
05:10:27.890 --> 05:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
reaffirms what was originally specified
 
05:10:30.890 --> 05:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
I think that a health care
 
05:10:32.750 --> 05:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
provider of Health Care Health Care
 
05:10:35.628 --> 05:10:35.638 align:start position:0%
Service plan or contractor shall not re
 
05:10:38.270 --> 05:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
release medical information related to a
 
05:10:41.570 --> 05:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
person or entity allowing a child to
 
05:10:44.690 --> 05:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
receive gender affirming health care or
 
05:10:53.930 --> 05:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:53.940 --> 05:10:55.208 align:start position:0%
 
in

05:10:55.208 --> 05:10:55.218 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:10:58.810 --> 05:10:58.820 align:start position:0%
354 C colon 9.
 
05:11:02.770 --> 05:11:02.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:06.708 --> 05:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
essentially the record any record of the
 
05:11:08.810 --> 05:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
information associated with the health
 
05:11:12.530 --> 05:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
care of a youth will not be shared
 
05:11:12.540 --> 05:11:14.750 align:start position:0%
care of a youth will not be shared
the

05:11:14.750 --> 05:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:11:18.230 --> 05:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
any records that do not discuss that
 
05:11:23.990 --> 05:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:28.010 --> 05:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
under a 3 354 C colon 10 arrest and
 
05:11:28.020 --> 05:11:30.050 align:start position:0%
under a 3 354 C colon 10 arrest and
extradition

05:11:30.050 --> 05:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
extradition
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
no state county or local law enforcement
 
05:11:36.610 --> 05:11:36.620 align:start position:0%
agency shall make or in Talent
 
05:11:39.110 --> 05:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
intentionally participate in the arrest
 
05:11:42.310 --> 05:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
or recognize any demand for extradition
 
05:11:45.890 --> 05:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
of an individual pursuant to a criminal
 
05:11:45.900 --> 05:11:47.570 align:start position:0%
of an individual pursuant to a criminal
action

05:11:47.570 --> 05:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
action
 
05:11:51.110 --> 05:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
related to the law of another state
 
05:11:53.810 --> 05:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
that criminalizes allowing a person to
 
05:11:56.270 --> 05:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
receive or provide gender affirming
 
05:12:00.708 --> 05:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:04.730 --> 05:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
and 354 C only 11.
 
05:12:04.740 --> 05:12:06.128 align:start position:0%
and 354 C only 11.
observability

05:12:06.128 --> 05:12:06.138 align:start position:0%
observability
 
05:12:10.970 --> 05:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:13.250 --> 05:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
um that's another good question for a
 
05:12:17.208 --> 05:12:17.218 align:start position:0%
legal expert and and um so I mean this
 
05:12:21.050 --> 05:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
this it covers a number of areas in in
 
05:12:24.350 --> 05:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
other states as well we're putting I'm
 
05:12:27.170 --> 05:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
requesting that we put this in place
 
05:12:30.288 --> 05:12:30.298 align:start position:0%
to protect the family
 
05:12:33.770 --> 05:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
of a child who moves to this state to
 
05:12:35.810 --> 05:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
protect them from prosecution from the
 
05:12:38.208 --> 05:12:38.218 align:start position:0%
state they left
 
05:12:40.490 --> 05:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
because now they have become a New
 
05:12:41.750 --> 05:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident
 
05:12:45.350 --> 05:12:45.360 align:start position:0%

05:12:56.340 --> 05:12:56.930 align:start position:0%
very much representative I have a
question

similar instances in New Hampshire when
we

05:13:09.590 --> 05:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:13:12.970 --> 05:13:12.980 align:start position:0%
stop law enforcements

from other states from doing the
investigation

05:14:26.930 --> 05:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
arrest or child removal for going out of
 
05:14:30.590 --> 05:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
state to receive this kind of treatment
 
05:14:32.628 --> 05:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of any incidences that
 
05:14:35.330 --> 05:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
this bill would address historically
 
05:14:39.110 --> 05:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
I I don't know of any specifically this
 
05:14:43.128 --> 05:14:43.138 align:start position:0%
is this is in advance of these 20 states
 
05:14:47.930 --> 05:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
that are considering this law currently
 
05:14:50.208 --> 05:14:50.218 align:start position:0%
um actually I believe that at least one
 
05:14:52.850 --> 05:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
state already does have a lot I'm trying
 
05:14:55.430 --> 05:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
to remember if it's Florida or I want
 
05:14:57.410 --> 05:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
one but there is at least one state that
 
05:15:00.948 --> 05:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
has this in place I mean has a law that
 
05:15:03.670 --> 05:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
makes it illegal for gender health care
 
05:15:07.430 --> 05:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
and uh this is being done in advance to
 
05:15:09.590 --> 05:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
let those family let families know if
 
05:15:11.690 --> 05:15:11.700 align:start position:0%
they're looking for a safe haven that
 
05:15:13.730 --> 05:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
they can move to our state and raise
 
05:15:17.390 --> 05:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:18.708 --> 05:15:18.718 align:start position:0%

yes would you like to speak thank you
 
05:15:59.030 --> 05:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:00.770 --> 05:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
can you push the red button thank you
 
05:16:03.230 --> 05:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
got it thank you so much everyone
 
05:16:06.110 --> 05:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
my name is Journey Lafond once again I
 
05:16:08.090 --> 05:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
am a conquered Community member I'm a
 
05:16:09.530 --> 05:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
therapist and I'm a parent to a
 
05:16:10.850 --> 05:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
transgender youth
 
05:16:13.190 --> 05:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
and I am very thankful to be able to say
 
05:16:15.770 --> 05:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
that my son is still with us today
 
05:16:17.690 --> 05:16:17.700 align:start position:0%
and we owe that blessing largely to the
 
05:16:19.070 --> 05:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
fact that he's been able to receive
 
05:16:22.190 --> 05:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care in this state
 
05:16:24.530 --> 05:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
my work with young people in the lgbtq
 
05:16:26.570 --> 05:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
plus Community has further cemented my
 
05:16:28.490 --> 05:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
belief that the best care whether mental
 
05:16:30.770 --> 05:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
health medical or non-medical Services
 
05:16:32.930 --> 05:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
is care that empowers a young person to
 
05:16:35.030 --> 05:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
tell us who they are
 
05:16:37.010 --> 05:16:37.020 align:start position:0%
when a young person discloses to their
 
05:16:39.230 --> 05:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
family that they are lgbtq plus and the
 
05:16:41.628 --> 05:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
response is one of invalidation Despair
 
05:16:45.110 --> 05:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
denial or even anger the resulting
 
05:16:49.010 --> 05:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
damage can take years to heal if that
 
05:16:51.230 --> 05:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
to be invalidated or even ostracized by
 
05:16:53.570 --> 05:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
one's own family creates a wound that
 
05:16:55.788 --> 05:16:55.798 align:start position:0%
not everyone is able to overcome which
 
05:16:58.850 --> 05:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
is why we talk about suicide rates rates
 
05:17:00.890 --> 05:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
of substance misuse and homelessness
 
05:17:04.670 --> 05:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
trending so high almost lgbtq plus youth
 
05:17:06.650 --> 05:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
the damage extends beyond the young
 
05:17:08.810 --> 05:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
person to the family who then feel the
 
05:17:10.970 --> 05:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
impact of that loss either that
 
05:17:12.170 --> 05:17:12.180 align:start position:0%
relationship or the young person
 
05:17:12.180 --> 05:17:13.430 align:start position:0%
relationship or the young person
themselves

05:17:13.430 --> 05:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
05:17:16.010 --> 05:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
when on the other hand they are met with
 
05:17:18.470 --> 05:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
validation acceptance and affirming care
 
05:17:21.350 --> 05:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
the prognosis changes dramatically
 
05:17:23.150 --> 05:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
these young people are more confident
 
05:17:25.190 --> 05:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
and engage in healthier habits and
 
05:17:27.830 --> 05:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
healthier lifestyle why would we deny
 
05:17:29.448 --> 05:17:29.458 align:start position:0%
young people from other states the
 
05:17:31.430 --> 05:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
ability to obtain care that affirms who
 
05:17:33.288 --> 05:17:33.298 align:start position:0%
they know themselves to be
 
05:17:35.270 --> 05:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
how can we in New Hampshire bar anyone
 
05:17:36.770 --> 05:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
from the care that they need to live
 
05:17:39.830 --> 05:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
free and self-actualize lives I am here
 
05:17:43.128 --> 05:17:43.138 align:start position:0%
to support HB 368 and I'm here to
 
05:17:45.770 --> 05:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
support lgbtq plus youth that's all for
 
05:17:47.628 --> 05:17:47.638 align:start position:0%
me but I'm happy to take questions thank
 
05:17:49.128 --> 05:17:49.138 align:start position:0%

05:17:50.750 --> 05:17:50.760 align:start position:0%

seeing none thank you thank you

have Morgan Brown if Morgan's here
 
05:18:27.110 --> 05:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:28.610 --> 05:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
and we're keeping it to three minutes
 
05:18:32.690 --> 05:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:34.910 --> 05:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee my
 
05:18:37.128 --> 05:18:37.138 align:start position:0%
name is Gwendolyn Ricard Hayes I'm a
 
05:18:38.750 --> 05:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
resident of Epping New Hampshire I'm
 
05:18:41.330 --> 05:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
here today to speak in strong support of
 
05:18:43.970 --> 05:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
house bill 368. those of us who have
 
05:18:45.470 --> 05:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
been paying close attention to the
 
05:18:46.970 --> 05:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
National conversation around trans
 
05:18:48.650 --> 05:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
people may have noticed something
 
05:18:50.930 --> 05:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
startling a certain faction of this
 
05:18:52.490 --> 05:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
country has quickly ramped up the
 
05:18:54.948 --> 05:18:54.958 align:start position:0%
rhetoric to genocidal levels look no
 
05:18:56.628 --> 05:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
further than the most recent CPAC
 
05:18:58.550 --> 05:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
conference where prominent far-right
 
05:19:00.770 --> 05:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
figure Michael Knowles blatantly calls
 
05:19:03.170 --> 05:19:03.180 align:start position:0%
for our eradication this is one of a
 
05:19:05.390 --> 05:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
multitude of examples
 
05:19:07.368 --> 05:19:07.378 align:start position:0%
should they get their way transness
 
05:19:09.650 --> 05:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
would be completely eliminated from
 
05:19:12.288 --> 05:19:12.298 align:start position:0%
public life this is akin to eliminating
 
05:19:14.628 --> 05:19:14.638 align:start position:0%
Jewish people from public life being
 
05:19:17.030 --> 05:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
trans is an integral and inherent part
 
05:19:19.788 --> 05:19:19.798 align:start position:0%
of who we are calls to remove transness
 
05:19:22.310 --> 05:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
are calls to remove trans people and we
 
05:19:24.170 --> 05:19:24.180 align:start position:0%
all know how unwanted minority groups
 
05:19:26.570 --> 05:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
have historically been removed
 
05:19:28.670 --> 05:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
there's zero doubt about it the far
 
05:19:30.410 --> 05:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
right are attempting to manifest the
 
05:19:33.530 --> 05:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
genocide the early stages you're getting
 
05:19:35.570 --> 05:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
pretty far into accusations could you
 
05:19:36.890 --> 05:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
please get to more of the content
 
05:19:40.730 --> 05:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:43.190 --> 05:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's zero doubt about it and the
 
05:19:45.530 --> 05:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
early stages have already begun as of as
 
05:19:47.690 --> 05:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
of now trans people trans children are
 
05:19:49.610 --> 05:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
the focus bills that forcibly
 
05:19:52.070 --> 05:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
detransition youth punish parents for
 
05:19:53.750 --> 05:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
seeking life-saving treatment for their
 
05:19:55.670 --> 05:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
kids along with many more discussing
 
05:19:57.470 --> 05:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation that have been
 
05:19:58.910 --> 05:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
seen in almost every single state
 
05:20:01.670 --> 05:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
including this one they won't start stop
 
05:20:03.650 --> 05:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
at targeting kids there's already been
 
05:20:05.690 --> 05:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
bills introduced to forcibly decent
 
05:20:07.910 --> 05:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
detransition adults if this goes
 
05:20:09.890 --> 05:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
unchecked there will soon be Mass Graves
 
05:20:11.990 --> 05:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
it won't be long until we have trans
 
05:20:14.628 --> 05:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
refugees personally I have already made
 
05:20:17.090 --> 05:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
plans in the case that my state decides
 
05:20:19.670 --> 05:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
to betray me all terrains people have to
 
05:20:21.770 --> 05:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
consider if their home will be safe for
 
05:20:24.110 --> 05:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
them in the future those who make the
 
05:20:26.810 --> 05:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
decision to flee must be welcomed with
 
05:20:29.030 --> 05:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
open and loving arms with that
 
05:20:31.550 --> 05:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
established we come to house bill 368.
 
05:20:33.288 --> 05:20:33.298 align:start position:0%
in essence this would make New Hampshire
 
05:20:36.530 --> 05:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
a safe safe haven for Trans people it
 
05:20:38.448 --> 05:20:38.458 align:start position:0%
would ensure that access to gender
 
05:20:40.670 --> 05:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
affirming care is unimpeded and content
 
05:20:42.708 --> 05:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
financiality is protected from
 
05:20:44.930 --> 05:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
out-of-state subpoenas were this to pass
 
05:20:47.208 --> 05:20:47.218 align:start position:0%
an enormous weight would be lifted off
 
05:20:49.010 --> 05:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
the back of all trans people living
 
05:20:51.170 --> 05:20:51.180 align:start position:0%
within the state the amount of stress we
 
05:20:53.090 --> 05:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
undergo having to see this country
 
05:20:55.610 --> 05:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
attempts to legislate us out of
 
05:20:58.550 --> 05:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
existence is debilitating the future as
 
05:21:01.250 --> 05:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
a trans person in America is scary and
 
05:21:03.350 --> 05:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
uncertain we are staring down the barrel
 
05:21:06.110 --> 05:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
of a genocide please show us that you
 
05:21:08.690 --> 05:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
accept trans people for who we are and
 
05:21:10.430 --> 05:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
will protect us from the powerful forces
 
05:21:12.470 --> 05:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
that wish to do us harm vote ought to
 
05:21:14.868 --> 05:21:14.878 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill 368 to save the lives
 
05:21:17.090 --> 05:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
of trans people thank you thank you for
 
05:21:19.550 --> 05:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
your testimony next time you testify if
 
05:21:20.830 --> 05:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
he could please be a little less
 
05:21:23.570 --> 05:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
accusatory to people that would be very
 
05:21:26.570 --> 05:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
very helpful to the case thank you
 
05:21:28.970 --> 05:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee thank

and I'm from Dover and I'm here to
 
05:21:50.390 --> 05:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
testify in support of house bill 368. by
 
05:21:52.010 --> 05:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
protecting gender affirming care in New
 
05:21:53.750 --> 05:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for people living out of state
 
05:21:56.330 --> 05:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
we protect our patients and our health
 
05:21:57.948 --> 05:21:57.958 align:start position:0%
care providers as well
 
05:21:59.750 --> 05:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
I've been working in healthcare for
 
05:22:01.430 --> 05:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
nearly 12 years in a variety of
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
capacities from being a pharmacy
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
technician nursing assistant and now
 
05:22:08.270 --> 05:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
registered nurse
 
05:22:09.770 --> 05:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
05:22:13.128 --> 05:22:13.138 align:start position:0%
almost 12 years just shy that
 
05:22:14.750 --> 05:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
I have had the honor to care for
 
05:22:17.150 --> 05:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
patients while ages from Pediatrics to
 
05:22:19.190 --> 05:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
long-term Assisted Living
 
05:22:21.650 --> 05:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
and I know that I must uphold nursing
 
05:22:23.090 --> 05:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
ethics by protecting patients
 
05:22:25.788 --> 05:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and this bill would
 
05:22:28.490 --> 05:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
protect people from being from being
 
05:22:31.550 --> 05:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
pressured to share confidential and
 
05:22:34.010 --> 05:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
sensitive health information
 
05:22:36.948 --> 05:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
to out-of-state entities
 
05:22:39.230 --> 05:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
under HIPAA
 
05:22:39.240 --> 05:22:40.788 align:start position:0%
under HIPAA
which

05:22:40.788 --> 05:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:22:44.208 --> 05:22:44.218 align:start position:0%
was enacted in 1996 gender affirming
 
05:22:48.050 --> 05:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:50.448 --> 05:22:50.458 align:start position:0%
and according to the Department of
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
05:22:56.448 --> 05:22:56.458 align:start position:0%
it the information under HIPAA is
 
05:22:58.430 --> 05:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
individually identifiable health
 
05:23:01.128 --> 05:23:01.138 align:start position:0%
information it's information including
 
05:23:04.070 --> 05:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
demographic data
 
05:23:07.310 --> 05:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
and it also protects an individual's
 
05:23:10.970 --> 05:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
past present or future physical or
 
05:23:14.868 --> 05:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:17.270 --> 05:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
right now we are seeing legislation in
 
05:23:19.490 --> 05:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
other states such as Tennessee
 
05:23:21.830 --> 05:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
that is Banning life-saving Medical
 
05:23:24.470 --> 05:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
Treatments such as gender affirming
 
05:23:26.510 --> 05:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
health care and this is gender
 
05:23:29.570 --> 05:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
discrimination and neglect of proper
 
05:23:30.890 --> 05:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
Health Care
 
05:23:32.628 --> 05:23:32.638 align:start position:0%
these people will need to leave their
 
05:23:35.590 --> 05:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
home states to continue accessing
 
05:23:38.390 --> 05:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
life-sustaining therapies and New
 
05:23:39.770 --> 05:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs to be proactive in
 
05:23:41.510 --> 05:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
protecting that
 
05:23:43.550 --> 05:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
safeguarding access to gender affirming
 
05:23:45.110 --> 05:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
care in New Hampshire creates safer
 
05:23:47.050 --> 05:23:47.060 align:start position:0%
Healthcare environments for all people
 
05:23:49.610 --> 05:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire residents and
 
05:23:51.830 --> 05:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire health care providers
 
05:23:53.868 --> 05:23:53.878 align:start position:0%
it is only a matter of time before our
 
05:23:55.430 --> 05:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
health care providers
 
05:23:58.070 --> 05:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
or doctors and our nurses are being
 
05:23:59.868 --> 05:23:59.878 align:start position:0%
questioned by out-of-state law
 
05:24:01.430 --> 05:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement about health care treatments
 
05:24:03.170 --> 05:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
being performed in New Hampshire
 
05:24:06.170 --> 05:24:06.180 align:start position:0%
bypassing House Bill 368 you would
 
05:24:08.390 --> 05:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
protect all New Hampshire health care
 
05:24:11.390 --> 05:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
providers in continuing to protect HIPAA
 
05:24:15.470 --> 05:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
and avoid ethical and moral dilemmas
 
05:24:19.010 --> 05:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
and HIPAA violations
 
05:24:21.770 --> 05:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote ought to pass on
 
05:24:24.470 --> 05:24:24.480 align:start position:0%

um as I said a couple of hours ago my
 
05:25:00.288 --> 05:25:00.298 align:start position:0%
name is Brady Berry I'm a student at the
 
05:25:01.910 --> 05:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire and I am
 
05:25:04.610 --> 05:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
transgender and non-binary
 
05:25:07.128 --> 05:25:07.138 align:start position:0%
um in short gender affirming care Saved
 
05:25:08.270 --> 05:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
My Life
 
05:25:09.288 --> 05:25:09.298 align:start position:0%
um before I started my medical
 
05:25:11.390 --> 05:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
transition every day was full of
 
05:25:13.010 --> 05:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
constant anxiety and a state of
 
05:25:13.020 --> 05:25:14.090 align:start position:0%
constant anxiety and a state of
depression

05:25:14.090 --> 05:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
depression
 
05:25:16.070 --> 05:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
being perceived as a woman when I knew I
 
05:25:17.390 --> 05:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't one was an exhausting
 
05:25:19.550 --> 05:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
never-ending source of stress
 
05:25:21.230 --> 05:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
waking up daily and feeling no
 
05:25:22.730 --> 05:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
connection to the body that physically
 
05:25:25.430 --> 05:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
held me up was deeply disheartening
 
05:25:27.288 --> 05:25:27.298 align:start position:0%
all of this led me to try and end my
 
05:25:29.090 --> 05:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
life two separate times because I felt
 
05:25:31.190 --> 05:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
so hopeless to live in this body
 
05:25:33.170 --> 05:25:33.180 align:start position:0%
today I stand before you haven't been
 
05:25:35.770 --> 05:25:35.780 align:start position:0%
having been doing gender affirming care
 
05:25:37.730 --> 05:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
in the form of hormone replacement
 
05:25:40.070 --> 05:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
therapy for over two years I can
 
05:25:42.170 --> 05:25:42.180 align:start position:0%
genuinely say I've never been happier
 
05:25:43.850 --> 05:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
starting to take hormones began my
 
05:25:45.410 --> 05:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
journey to becoming my authentic self
 
05:25:47.448 --> 05:25:47.458 align:start position:0%
and I'm still on that Journey while
 
05:25:49.730 --> 05:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
testosterone has made my voice deeper my
 
05:25:51.470 --> 05:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
face more square and given me facial
 
05:25:54.110 --> 05:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
hair the impact is much deeper than that
 
05:25:56.390 --> 05:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
the impact is self-love for the person I
 
05:25:58.610 --> 05:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
am and the person I'm becoming the
 
05:26:00.288 --> 05:26:00.298 align:start position:0%
impact is significantly better mental
 
05:26:02.628 --> 05:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
health and easier time focusing and an
 
05:26:03.948 --> 05:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
easier time holding meaningful
 
05:26:03.958 --> 05:26:05.810 align:start position:0%
easier time holding meaningful
relationships

05:26:05.810 --> 05:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
relationships
 
05:26:07.430 --> 05:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
more than this I'm a college student
 
05:26:08.990 --> 05:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
from Maine going to school here in the
 
05:26:10.670 --> 05:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and I get my
 
05:26:12.050 --> 05:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
hormones here
 
05:26:14.030 --> 05:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
being able to have access to this care
 
05:26:15.708 --> 05:26:15.718 align:start position:0%
in the state where I spend most of my
 
05:26:17.690 --> 05:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
time has made my life significantly
 
05:26:19.670 --> 05:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
easier and it made it so I don't have to
 
05:26:20.750 --> 05:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
worry about traveling to a different
 
05:26:22.730 --> 05:26:22.740 align:start position:0%
state just to feel like myself
 
05:26:24.110 --> 05:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
while I'm lucky that gender information
 
05:26:26.208 --> 05:26:26.218 align:start position:0%
care is legal in Maine as well there are
 
05:26:27.948 --> 05:26:27.958 align:start position:0%
citizens of other states who can't say
 
05:26:30.170 --> 05:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
the same no one should have to be scared
 
05:26:31.670 --> 05:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
to seek out the care that is going to
 
05:26:33.350 --> 05:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
greatly improve their quality of life
 
05:26:35.510 --> 05:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
and for people in states that allow
 
05:26:37.730 --> 05:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care that feels fear is
 
05:26:39.050 --> 05:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
a reality
 
05:26:40.670 --> 05:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
it is so vital that we keep gender
 
05:26:42.350 --> 05:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
affirming Healthcare safe and accessible
 
05:26:44.750 --> 05:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
in this state with so many other states
 
05:26:46.430 --> 05:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
gatekeeping their gender affirming Care
 
05:26:48.350 --> 05:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has the ability to be a
 
05:26:50.090 --> 05:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
safe haven for so many people
 
05:26:51.770 --> 05:26:51.780 align:start position:0%
no one is wrong for seeking out gender
 
05:26:53.510 --> 05:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
affirming care and they should not be
 
05:26:55.850 --> 05:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
treated as a criminal for doing so
 
05:26:57.890 --> 05:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
I spent 18 years on this Earth before I
 
05:26:59.750 --> 05:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
could access the care I needed and it
 
05:27:02.208 --> 05:27:02.218 align:start position:0%
changed my life for these reasons I urge
 
05:27:05.030 --> 05:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
you to support hb368 and to support the
 
05:27:06.410 --> 05:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
lives of other transgender folks
 
05:27:06.420 --> 05:27:08.448 align:start position:0%
lives of other transgender folks
Nationwide

05:27:08.448 --> 05:27:08.458 align:start position:0%
Nationwide
 
05:27:10.128 --> 05:27:10.138 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee and if
 
05:27:13.128 --> 05:27:13.138 align:start position:0%
you'd like to submit the written
 
05:27:15.830 --> 05:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
testimony for the record thank you and
 
05:27:17.930 --> 05:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
thank you now we have best care and
 
05:27:20.570 --> 05:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
after that we will have Jay lebreck I
 
05:27:23.990 --> 05:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
think that's that's scared from Nashua I
 
05:27:27.650 --> 05:27:27.660 align:start position:0%
was surprised when the lobbyist for HB
 
05:27:30.708 --> 05:27:30.718 align:start position:0%
619 who was with the organization born
 
05:27:30.718 --> 05:27:31.910 align:start position:0%
619 who was with the organization born
perfect

05:27:31.910 --> 05:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
05:27:35.810 --> 05:27:35.820 align:start position:0%
didn't testify in favor of 619 because
 
05:27:38.270 --> 05:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
it's all about kids being born perfect
 
05:27:40.390 --> 05:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
just the way they are
 
05:27:43.070 --> 05:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
my niece who grew up in a dysfunctional
 
05:27:47.208 --> 05:27:47.218 align:start position:0%
family situation went on testosterone as
 
05:27:49.250 --> 05:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
a 17 year old
 
05:27:51.170 --> 05:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
she thought it would solve her problems
 
05:27:53.510 --> 05:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
but it only made them worse
 
05:27:56.750 --> 05:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
she died at 21 from a drug overdose
 
05:27:59.690 --> 05:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
after threatening suicide
 
05:28:02.810 --> 05:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
a young California woman Chloe Cole
 
05:28:04.310 --> 05:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
testified about her experience
 
05:28:07.070 --> 05:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
transitioning as a minor she began to
 
05:28:09.470 --> 05:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
transition to a male at 13 she had a
 
05:28:12.230 --> 05:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
double mastectomy at 15 and she
 
05:28:15.110 --> 05:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
de-transitioned at 17. from her
 
05:28:17.090 --> 05:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
testimony despite all these
 
05:28:19.010 --> 05:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
consultations and classes I don't feel
 
05:28:21.010 --> 05:28:21.020 align:start position:0%
like I understood all the ramifications
 
05:28:23.448 --> 05:28:23.458 align:start position:0%
that came with any of the medical
 
05:28:26.270 --> 05:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
decisions I was making I didn't realize
 
05:28:28.368 --> 05:28:28.378 align:start position:0%
how traumatic the recovery from my
 
05:28:30.770 --> 05:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
double mastectomy would be
 
05:28:32.810 --> 05:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
the worst part about my transition would
 
05:28:34.610 --> 05:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
be the long-term health effects that I
 
05:28:37.550 --> 05:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
didn't knowingly consent to at the time
 
05:28:39.650 --> 05:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
from Lisa Marciano writing in the
 
05:28:41.330 --> 05:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
journal psychological perspectives
 
05:28:43.910 --> 05:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of anecdotal evidence
 
05:28:46.128 --> 05:28:46.138 align:start position:0%
that young people are receiving hormone
 
05:28:48.350 --> 05:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
hormone prescriptions without careful
 
05:28:48.360 --> 05:28:49.850 align:start position:0%
hormone prescriptions without careful
assessment

05:28:49.850 --> 05:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
05:28:53.628 --> 05:28:53.638 align:start position:0%
in the study of 200d transition women 65
 
05:28:55.368 --> 05:28:55.378 align:start position:0%
percent of them responded that they
 
05:28:58.010 --> 05:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
received no therapy before starting
 
05:29:00.890 --> 05:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
hormones most who had been so had been
 
05:29:03.288 --> 05:29:03.298 align:start position:0%
to therapy at only a handful of sessions
 
05:29:05.570 --> 05:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
before being given a letter for hormones
 
05:29:08.390 --> 05:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
the median age for starting transition
 
05:29:11.690 --> 05:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
among those who answered was 17. that's
 
05:29:14.330 --> 05:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
Carrie Stella a young woman who posted a
 
05:29:16.070 --> 05:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
video on YouTube about her experiences
 
05:29:18.770 --> 05:29:18.780 align:start position:0%
both transitioning as a minor and D
 
05:29:21.170 --> 05:29:21.180 align:start position:0%
transitioning as an adult reports that
 
05:29:23.150 --> 05:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
no one told her she had any other
 
05:29:25.368 --> 05:29:25.378 align:start position:0%
options they don't tell you that it's
 
05:29:27.830 --> 05:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay to be Butch to be gender
 
05:29:27.840 --> 05:29:29.390 align:start position:0%
okay to be Butch to be gender
non-conforming

05:29:29.390 --> 05:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
non-conforming
 
05:29:31.310 --> 05:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
to not like men
 
05:29:34.310 --> 05:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
to not like the way men treat you they
 
05:29:37.128 --> 05:29:37.138 align:start position:0%
tell you about testosterone
 
05:29:38.868 --> 05:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
Stella asks how many other medical
 
05:29:40.610 --> 05:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
conditions are there where you can walk
 
05:29:43.250 --> 05:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
into the doctor's office tell them you
 
05:29:45.948 --> 05:29:45.958 align:start position:0%
have a certain condition which has no
 
05:29:48.708 --> 05:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
objective test which can be caused by
 
05:29:51.650 --> 05:29:51.660 align:start position:0%
trauma or mental issues
 
05:29:54.050 --> 05:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
or others or societal factors and
 
05:29:56.570 --> 05:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
receive life-altering medications on
 
05:29:58.070 --> 05:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
your say so
 
05:30:00.170 --> 05:30:00.180 align:start position:0%
please don't make New Hampshire into a
 
05:30:02.090 --> 05:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
sanctuary state where you
 
05:30:05.030 --> 05:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
where kids and teens are being
 
05:30:05.040 --> 05:30:06.470 align:start position:0%
where kids and teens are being
fast-tracked

05:30:06.470 --> 05:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
fast-tracked
 
05:30:09.590 --> 05:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
onto into medical transition losing
 
05:30:12.610 --> 05:30:12.620 align:start position:0%
their dis damaging their bodies
 
05:30:15.890 --> 05:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
irreversibly and becoming infertile
 
05:30:19.788 --> 05:30:19.798 align:start position:0%
please vote itl and HB 368
 
05:30:21.288 --> 05:30:21.298 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:30:21.298 --> 05:30:23.570 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
representative

05:30:23.570 --> 05:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:30:25.610 --> 05:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:30:28.788 --> 05:30:28.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question so in this scenario
 
05:30:34.368 --> 05:30:34.378 align:start position:0%
if a mind levels greeting some hormonal
 
05:30:37.090 --> 05:30:37.100 align:start position:0%
treatment or some other
 
05:30:41.830 --> 05:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
irreversible treatment without proper
 
05:30:41.840 --> 05:30:43.390 align:start position:0%
irreversible treatment without proper
uh

05:30:43.390 --> 05:30:43.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:30:46.690 --> 05:30:46.700 align:start position:0%
identifications and proper understanding
 
05:30:51.410 --> 05:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
is there any legal way in the future for
 
05:30:55.270 --> 05:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
that person to go after medical
 
05:30:56.990 --> 05:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
professionals so other people
 
05:30:59.208 --> 05:30:59.218 align:start position:0%
responsible for that
 
05:31:01.910 --> 05:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
did you mean to turn back
 
05:31:04.730 --> 05:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean
 
05:31:08.530 --> 05:31:08.540 align:start position:0%
is there any legal recourse for
 
05:31:11.050 --> 05:31:11.060 align:start position:0%
the transition
 
05:31:14.770 --> 05:31:14.780 align:start position:0%
to go after people who transitioned
 
05:31:18.530 --> 05:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
Himachal without proper notifying about
 
05:31:20.448 --> 05:31:20.458 align:start position:0%
side effects for example
 
05:31:22.670 --> 05:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
well I mean theoretically they could I
 
05:31:25.490 --> 05:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
mean Chloe Cole is suing Kaiser
 
05:31:28.550 --> 05:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
Permanente in California and there's
 
05:31:30.610 --> 05:31:30.620 align:start position:0%
there's other
 
05:31:33.410 --> 05:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
detransitioners who are suing and I I
 
05:31:35.510 --> 05:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
look forward to the day that happens in
 
05:31:37.250 --> 05:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire too because
 
05:31:39.288 --> 05:31:39.298 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people doing bad things
 
05:31:41.448 --> 05:31:41.458 align:start position:0%
for the kids and and they really
 
05:31:44.890 --> 05:31:44.900 align:start position:0%
shouldn't you know they really should be
 
05:31:50.448 --> 05:31:50.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:52.128 --> 05:31:52.138 align:start position:0%
thank you very much seeing no further
 
05:31:54.770 --> 05:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
questions I'm going to hand the gavel
 
05:32:03.650 --> 05:32:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:03.660 --> 05:32:05.110 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:32:05.110 --> 05:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:32:13.690 --> 05:32:13.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:17.628 --> 05:32:17.638 align:start position:0%
okay next up to speak is a Jayla Breck
 
05:32:23.570 --> 05:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:25.610 --> 05:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
05:32:28.368 --> 05:32:28.378 align:start position:0%
my name is Jay lebreck I was born down
 
05:32:30.470 --> 05:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
the street in Concord and I've lived in
 
05:32:32.628 --> 05:32:32.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire my whole life
 
05:32:35.990 --> 05:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'm trans non-binary I'm 20 years old
 
05:32:38.810 --> 05:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
though I can confidently say I feel much
 
05:32:41.690 --> 05:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
older with the constant weight on my
 
05:32:45.350 --> 05:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
back of having to prove to people that I
 
05:32:45.360 --> 05:32:46.610 align:start position:0%
back of having to prove to people that I
exist

05:32:46.610 --> 05:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
exist
 
05:32:48.830 --> 05:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
it's exhausting and the pain we
 
05:32:51.110 --> 05:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
experience is real
 
05:32:51.120 --> 05:32:52.250 align:start position:0%
experience is real
but

05:32:52.250 --> 05:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:32:56.030 --> 05:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
I must stand up for kids like me
 
05:32:59.090 --> 05:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
so I am standing here today because I
 
05:33:01.010 --> 05:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
was allowed to be who I am now and
 
05:33:03.708 --> 05:33:03.718 align:start position:0%
always have been I urge you to support
 
05:33:03.718 --> 05:33:05.628 align:start position:0%
always have been I urge you to support
368.

05:33:05.628 --> 05:33:05.638 align:start position:0%
368.
 
05:33:07.910 --> 05:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
in the past few weeks several states
 
05:33:09.948 --> 05:33:09.958 align:start position:0%
have passed or are considering passing
 
05:33:12.230 --> 05:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
dangerous legislation that would
 
05:33:13.788 --> 05:33:13.798 align:start position:0%
prohibit gender affirming care for
 
05:33:16.310 --> 05:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
minors not only is this cruel and
 
05:33:18.350 --> 05:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
inhumane but will likely be deadly for
 
05:33:20.510 --> 05:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
Trans youth in these states I believe
 
05:33:22.610 --> 05:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire holds an
 
05:33:25.010 --> 05:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
obligation to protect any children that
 
05:33:26.990 --> 05:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
pass within our borders and this
 
05:33:28.730 --> 05:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
includes protecting their supportive
 
05:33:31.250 --> 05:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
parents from prosecution
 
05:33:33.948 --> 05:33:33.958 align:start position:0%
I know firsthand how life-changing and
 
05:33:36.050 --> 05:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
life-saving it is to receive the care
 
05:33:38.030 --> 05:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
that you need to exist as your authentic
 
05:33:41.090 --> 05:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
self before I transitioned I struggled a
 
05:33:43.310 --> 05:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
lot as a kid to try to figure out what
 
05:33:46.670 --> 05:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
was wrong with me despite popular belief
 
05:33:49.310 --> 05:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
no one suggested that there was any
 
05:33:51.230 --> 05:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
possibility that I could be transgender
 
05:33:55.430 --> 05:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
I was never ever told about the topic it
 
05:33:57.650 --> 05:33:57.660 align:start position:0%
was it nothing that ever came up in
 
05:34:00.110 --> 05:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
conversation and where I live being
 
05:34:01.610 --> 05:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
gender non-conforming was not
 
05:34:04.070 --> 05:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily welcomed with open arms
 
05:34:05.868 --> 05:34:05.878 align:start position:0%
this was a time where I could have
 
05:34:08.030 --> 05:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
flourished instead I felt ashamed of
 
05:34:10.250 --> 05:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
myself I've long thought about what I
 
05:34:12.350 --> 05:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
could have achieved in public schools if
 
05:34:14.990 --> 05:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
my trans peers and I had received some
 
05:34:16.670 --> 05:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
form of gender affirming care or
 
05:34:18.890 --> 05:34:18.900 align:start position:0%
guidance My Hope Was That by this time
 
05:34:20.690 --> 05:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
society would have evolved to support
 
05:34:23.208 --> 05:34:23.218 align:start position:0%
trans kids and allow them to thrive but
 
05:34:25.490 --> 05:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
it is clear that in many states this is
 
05:34:28.128 --> 05:34:28.138 align:start position:0%
not the case however as of right now New
 
05:34:29.570 --> 05:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire remains a place where children
 
05:34:32.090 --> 05:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
can receive the care that they need it
 
05:34:33.470 --> 05:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
is essential that their parents be
 
05:34:35.628 --> 05:34:35.638 align:start position:0%
protected from prosecution by their home
 
05:34:37.850 --> 05:34:37.860 align:start position:0%
States for seeking this care if this
 
05:34:40.190 --> 05:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
bill is not passed parents may not be
 
05:34:42.410 --> 05:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
able to legally help their child even
 
05:34:44.510 --> 05:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
after leaving their home state to do so
 
05:34:46.970 --> 05:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
losing a child is every parent's worst
 
05:34:48.830 --> 05:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
nightmare and parents of transgender
 
05:34:50.510 --> 05:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
youth would have to choose between
 
05:34:52.550 --> 05:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
risking their child's life and
 
05:34:55.430 --> 05:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
well-being or being prosecuted this is
 
05:34:57.590 --> 05:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
an unnecessary choice that no parent
 
05:34:59.030 --> 05:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
should have to make
 
05:35:01.430 --> 05:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
05:35:03.590 --> 05:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
I'll accept any questions any questions
 
05:35:07.250 --> 05:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
from committee representative McLean
 
05:35:09.470 --> 05:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and uh thank you for
 
05:35:11.090 --> 05:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
sharing your story
 
05:35:13.310 --> 05:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
um I did have one question though in in
 
05:35:14.930 --> 05:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
the states that you said that are
 
05:35:17.510 --> 05:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
bringing forth this legislation are you
 
05:35:20.090 --> 05:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
aware is there a component of that
 
05:35:20.100 --> 05:35:21.770 align:start position:0%
aware is there a component of that
legislation

05:35:21.770 --> 05:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:35:25.310 --> 05:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
um that would legally penalize parents
 
05:35:28.670 --> 05:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
if they go to another state uh so that
 
05:35:30.288 --> 05:35:30.298 align:start position:0%
their children can have this kind of
 
05:35:30.298 --> 05:35:31.070 align:start position:0%
their children can have this kind of
care

05:35:31.070 --> 05:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:35:33.590 --> 05:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
yes so uh I have unfortunately I'm a
 
05:35:34.910 --> 05:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
college student have had a lot of time
 
05:35:37.190 --> 05:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
to read up on all of them because as far
 
05:35:39.410 --> 05:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
as I'm aware there are over uh several
 
05:35:41.448 --> 05:35:41.458 align:start position:0%
hundred of those bills
 
05:35:43.368 --> 05:35:43.378 align:start position:0%
um just targeting transgender people in
 
05:35:46.730 --> 05:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
general so I am not aware as to whether
 
05:35:50.690 --> 05:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
or not that is something that is a
 
05:35:53.208 --> 05:35:53.218 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in those bills but that's
 
05:35:54.770 --> 05:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
definitely something to further research
 
05:35:54.780 --> 05:35:56.810 align:start position:0%
definitely something to further research
yes

05:35:56.810 --> 05:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:35:59.690 --> 05:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:02.150 --> 05:36:02.160 align:start position:0%

next up to speak is Kim Peasley to be
 
05:36:25.250 --> 05:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:27.650 --> 05:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
so that person is
 
05:36:29.330 --> 05:36:29.340 align:start position:0%

05:36:48.170 --> 05:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:50.690 --> 05:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
picture McDonald and
 
05:36:53.510 --> 05:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
a knee for giving us so much time to
 
05:36:56.030 --> 05:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
speak today my name is Courtney Reed and
 
05:36:58.670 --> 05:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
I'm here on behalf of the ACLU of New
 
05:37:00.410 --> 05:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I wanted to test upon
 
05:37:04.490 --> 05:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
testify in support of HB 368 which as
 
05:37:06.110 --> 05:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
we've heard would protect out of state
 
05:37:08.208 --> 05:37:08.218 align:start position:0%
transgender Health Care Seekers from
 
05:37:10.368 --> 05:37:10.378 align:start position:0%
being prosecuted when they return to
 
05:37:12.830 --> 05:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
their home States I want to underscore
 
05:37:14.990 --> 05:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire should be proactive
 
05:37:16.430 --> 05:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
in protecting the right for gender
 
05:37:19.550 --> 05:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
affirming care because the current
 
05:37:23.208 --> 05:37:23.218 align:start position:0%
political landscape has issued out
 
05:37:25.190 --> 05:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
numerous attacks on the right to
 
05:37:27.890 --> 05:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
affirming care for transgender youth in
 
05:37:31.970 --> 05:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
particular about 58 200 transgender
 
05:37:34.128 --> 05:37:34.138 align:start position:0%
youth in the U.S are currently at risk
 
05:37:35.868 --> 05:37:35.878 align:start position:0%
of losing access to care because of
 
05:37:39.050 --> 05:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
these possible bans and we're seeing in
 
05:37:42.110 --> 05:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
23 States bills are considered being
 
05:37:43.250 --> 05:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
considered that would ban gender
 
05:37:44.570 --> 05:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
affirming care
 
05:37:46.610 --> 05:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
and we know that medical experts agree
 
05:37:48.350 --> 05:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
that gender affirming care is medically
 
05:37:51.230 --> 05:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
necessary and life-saving care
 
05:37:53.330 --> 05:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
so politicians shouldn't intervene in
 
05:37:54.948 --> 05:37:54.958 align:start position:0%
these medical decisions that belong to
 
05:37:57.708 --> 05:37:57.718 align:start position:0%
Children parents and their doctors
 
05:38:00.350 --> 05:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
and we've also seen recent polling in
 
05:38:01.850 --> 05:38:01.860 align:start position:0%
deep red States and at the national
 
05:38:04.250 --> 05:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
level the bans on gender affirming care
 
05:38:05.750 --> 05:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
are unpopular
 
05:38:08.208 --> 05:38:08.218 align:start position:0%
recently 71 percent of pulled
 
05:38:10.430 --> 05:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
kentuckians said they would oppose state
 
05:38:13.910 --> 05:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
law that restricts bans restricts access
 
05:38:16.550 --> 05:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
to gender affirming care and 66 percent
 
05:38:20.930 --> 05:38:20.940 align:start position:0%
of adults Nationwide oppose limits on
 
05:38:22.730 --> 05:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
transition related medical care for
 
05:38:22.740 --> 05:38:23.930 align:start position:0%
transition related medical care for
minors

05:38:23.930 --> 05:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
minors
 
05:38:26.090 --> 05:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to just reiterate that it's
 
05:38:28.128 --> 05:38:28.138 align:start position:0%
time that the granite state make things
 
05:38:29.930 --> 05:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
clear that legislators have no business
 
05:38:32.810 --> 05:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
telling parents they cannot um
 
05:38:34.970 --> 05:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
seek life-saving care for their
 
05:38:36.948 --> 05:38:36.958 align:start position:0%
transgender children
 
05:38:39.708 --> 05:38:39.718 align:start position:0%
and for many people affirming care is is
 
05:38:42.110 --> 05:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
necessary for basic survival and
 
05:38:43.628 --> 05:38:43.638 align:start position:0%
everyone has the right to be themselves
 
05:38:46.510 --> 05:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
whether it be in school or in other
 
05:38:48.650 --> 05:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
environments so it's time that we
 
05:38:50.150 --> 05:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
protect these rights in the granite
 
05:38:53.330 --> 05:38:53.340 align:start position:0%
state bypassing 368. thank you and I can
 
05:38:55.670 --> 05:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you
 
05:38:57.470 --> 05:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members yes
 
05:39:00.110 --> 05:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
05:39:02.208 --> 05:39:02.218 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:39:04.190 --> 05:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I just kind of
 
05:39:05.868 --> 05:39:05.878 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on the question that
 
05:39:08.690 --> 05:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
you know I asked Mr lebreck which was
 
05:39:11.690 --> 05:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
um with the 23 states that you mentioned
 
05:39:14.170 --> 05:39:14.180 align:start position:0%
that are considering the ban
 
05:39:17.570 --> 05:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in any one of those 23
 
05:39:20.750 --> 05:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
considerations is there anything that
 
05:39:20.760 --> 05:39:21.590 align:start position:0%
considerations is there anything that
would

05:39:21.590 --> 05:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:39:24.650 --> 05:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
bring forth civil or criminal penalties
 
05:39:27.470 --> 05:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
on those folks that left the state to
 
05:39:29.690 --> 05:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
seek that kind of care for their
 
05:39:29.700 --> 05:39:31.310 align:start position:0%
seek that kind of care for their
children

05:39:31.310 --> 05:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:39:33.590 --> 05:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so
 
05:39:36.590 --> 05:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
I want to let our
 
05:39:38.448 --> 05:39:38.458 align:start position:0%
Allied attorneys in the room answer that
 
05:39:40.430 --> 05:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
question better than my own ability
 
05:39:41.810 --> 05:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
because I'm not a practicing attorney
 
05:39:45.070 --> 05:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
but from my understanding
 
05:39:47.270 --> 05:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that we're considering today
 
05:39:50.170 --> 05:39:50.180 align:start position:0%
that would ban affirming care also puts
 
05:39:52.788 --> 05:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
providers who offer out-of-state
 
05:39:56.510 --> 05:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
referrals at risk of civil and criminal
 
05:40:00.890 --> 05:40:00.900 align:start position:0%
suits so if you want to refer someone
 
05:40:02.570 --> 05:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
seeking gender affirming care in a state
 
05:40:04.550 --> 05:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
where it is still legal you are subject
 
05:40:06.470 --> 05:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
to risk of litigation and I think that's
 
05:40:09.530 --> 05:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
what this bill aims to protect people
 
05:40:11.930 --> 05:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
seeking care in New Hampshire from
 
05:40:15.530 --> 05:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah other questions
 
05:40:17.868 --> 05:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
saying all the questions thank you oh
 
05:40:19.970 --> 05:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry oh representative Weber I'm
 
05:40:19.980 --> 05:40:22.010 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry oh representative Weber I'm
sorry

05:40:22.010 --> 05:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:40:24.050 --> 05:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
you're quite all right
 
05:40:27.170 --> 05:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
so am I right in thinking that the
 
05:40:29.930 --> 05:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
purpose of this is perspectively to to
 
05:40:32.570 --> 05:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
protect the rights of parents to parent
 
05:40:34.070 --> 05:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
their children
 
05:40:38.170 --> 05:40:38.180 align:start position:0%
and also a medical practitioners
 
05:40:41.990 --> 05:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
wherever they are located to be able to
 
05:40:43.910 --> 05:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
treat their patients
 
05:40:45.590 --> 05:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
in accordance with best medical
 
05:40:47.690 --> 05:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
practices free from governmental
 
05:40:47.700 --> 05:40:50.270 align:start position:0%
practices free from governmental
interference

05:40:50.270 --> 05:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
interference
 
05:40:52.250 --> 05:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding of the
 
05:40:55.628 --> 05:40:55.638 align:start position:0%
legislation and moreover it's
 
05:40:58.090 --> 05:40:58.100 align:start position:0%
enabling that right to care for
 
05:41:02.390 --> 05:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:05.150 --> 05:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:06.948 --> 05:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
I think that's it okay thank you thank
 
05:41:06.958 --> 05:41:09.470 align:start position:0%
I think that's it okay thank you thank
you

05:41:09.470 --> 05:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:12.410 --> 05:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
next up to speak is Sam Hawkins and then
 
05:41:15.530 --> 05:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
Stephanie Cowley
 
05:41:17.208 --> 05:41:17.218 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
05:41:19.128 --> 05:41:19.138 align:start position:0%

05:41:20.810 --> 05:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
public policy assistant at Nami New
 
05:41:22.128 --> 05:41:22.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the National Alliance on
 
05:41:24.470 --> 05:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
Mental Illness on behalf of Nami New
 
05:41:25.970 --> 05:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here today to speak in
 
05:41:29.390 --> 05:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
support of HB 638 368.
 
05:41:31.430 --> 05:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh at this point you've heard the
 
05:41:33.050 --> 05:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
statistics surrounding depression and
 
05:41:35.208 --> 05:41:35.218 align:start position:0%
suicide for Trans individuals and you've
 
05:41:36.410 --> 05:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
heard the solution
 
05:41:37.970 --> 05:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
access to care
 
05:41:39.530 --> 05:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
multiple studies show that gender
 
05:41:41.030 --> 05:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
affirming medical treatment is
 
05:41:42.650 --> 05:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
significantly associated with lowered
 
05:41:44.448 --> 05:41:44.458 align:start position:0%
odds of depression and suicide attempts
 
05:41:47.030 --> 05:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
for transgender and non-binary Youth not
 
05:41:48.590 --> 05:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
only is the availability of this care

necessity but in light the legislative
 
05:41:52.670 --> 05:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
attacks both locally and Across the
 
05:41:54.590 --> 05:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
Nation gender affirming care must be
 
05:41:56.448 --> 05:41:56.458 align:start position:0%
made safe and protected for the
 
05:41:58.910 --> 05:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
individuals and families that pursue it
 
05:42:01.730 --> 05:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
in 2021 the American Medical Association
 
05:42:03.708 --> 05:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
firmly stated their opposition to the
 
05:42:05.208 --> 05:42:05.218 align:start position:0%
rise of governmental overreach into
 
05:42:06.890 --> 05:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
medical care for transgender and
 
05:42:08.570 --> 05:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
non-binary individuals
 
05:42:11.628 --> 05:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
Michael souk MD JD and board member for
 
05:42:14.030 --> 05:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
the AMA is quoted as saying gender
 
05:42:15.910 --> 05:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
affirming care is medically necessary
 
05:42:18.170 --> 05:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
evidence-based care that improves the
 
05:42:19.310 --> 05:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
physical and mental health of
 
05:42:21.050 --> 05:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
transgender and gender diverse people
 
05:42:23.930 --> 05:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
and that the organization quote opposes
 
05:42:25.610 --> 05:42:25.620 align:start position:0%
the dangerous intrusion of government
 
05:42:27.890 --> 05:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
into the practice of medicine and the
 
05:42:29.570 --> 05:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
criminalization of Health Care decision
 
05:42:29.580 --> 05:42:30.830 align:start position:0%
criminalization of Health Care decision
making

05:42:30.830 --> 05:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
making
 
05:42:32.990 --> 05:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care is life-saving
 
05:42:34.610 --> 05:42:34.620 align:start position:0%
care and we must dedicate ourselves to
 
05:42:35.930 --> 05:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
providing whatever protections are
 
05:42:38.510 --> 05:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
necessary for its continued practice the
 
05:42:40.910 --> 05:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
safeguards present in HB 368 help
 
05:42:42.470 --> 05:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
accomplish this goal and would allow
 
05:42:44.090 --> 05:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
individuals and families to feel safe
 
05:42:45.890 --> 05:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
pursuing this Critical Care in the
 
05:42:48.170 --> 05:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
granite state additionally this bill
 
05:42:49.550 --> 05:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
would go far in establishing New
 
05:42:51.110 --> 05:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a welcoming and affirming
 
05:42:52.850 --> 05:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
environment for all transgender and
 
05:42:54.410 --> 05:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
non-binary people in their families
 
05:42:56.390 --> 05:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
supportive of their physical and mental
 
05:42:58.610 --> 05:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
well-being for these reasons Nami New
 
05:43:00.170 --> 05:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire urges the committee to vote
 
05:43:01.128 --> 05:43:01.138 align:start position:0%

transgender veteran if I had not been
 
05:43:46.010 --> 05:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
afforded the opportunity to reach out to
 
05:43:47.750 --> 05:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
a helpline and get mental health I would
 
05:43:49.788 --> 05:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
not be standing here today four years
 
05:43:52.430 --> 05:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
ago I would have killed myself over a
 
05:43:55.010 --> 05:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
janitor identity crisis I applaud this
 
05:43:56.510 --> 05:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing this bill and
 
05:43:58.970 --> 05:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
those who propose it to protect medical
 
05:44:00.850 --> 05:44:00.860 align:start position:0%
and mental health
 
05:44:04.910 --> 05:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
affirming care for all in this state it
 
05:44:07.128 --> 05:44:07.138 align:start position:0%
is very important that we protect every
 
05:44:10.128 --> 05:44:10.138 align:start position:0%
individual as we are all humans I
 
05:44:12.350 --> 05:44:12.360 align:start position:0%

thank you you're taking questions
 
05:44:21.948 --> 05:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:44:33.288 --> 05:44:33.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:35.330 --> 05:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
next step to speak is Chris Churchill to

to the committee and thank you to rep
 
05:44:43.310 --> 05:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
Cannon for introducing this really
 
05:44:46.430 --> 05:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
important piece of legislation
 
05:44:47.930 --> 05:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
um I kind of want to break this down in
 
05:44:49.850 --> 05:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
a little more practical way than what
 
05:44:52.430 --> 05:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
we've been hearing so far in the state
 
05:44:55.368 --> 05:44:55.378 align:start position:0%
of Texas one year ago almost to this
 
05:44:57.770 --> 05:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
week I think one year ago the Department
 
05:44:59.628 --> 05:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
of Children and Family Services in that
 
05:45:02.448 --> 05:45:02.458 align:start position:0%
state began investigating families and
 
05:45:04.128 --> 05:45:04.138 align:start position:0%
removing with the intent to remove
 
05:45:05.990 --> 05:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
children from their homes if their
 
05:45:08.868 --> 05:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
parents were allowing them or supporting
 
05:45:11.690 --> 05:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
them in obtaining gender affirming
 
05:45:15.170 --> 05:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
health care and uh as you can imagine
 
05:45:17.510 --> 05:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
there was a really really scary time for
 
05:45:20.030 --> 05:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
those families who were actively seeking
 
05:45:21.590 --> 05:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
out health care for for their children
 
05:45:23.930 --> 05:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
and and it doesn't matter what your
 
05:45:25.490 --> 05:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
political beliefs are I think every
 
05:45:27.650 --> 05:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
single person in this room can relate to
 
05:45:29.810 --> 05:45:29.820 align:start position:0%
or can imagine can put themselves in the
 
05:45:31.850 --> 05:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
shoes of someone who's being told that
 
05:45:34.490 --> 05:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
their kids will be taken from them if
 
05:45:36.350 --> 05:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
they continue to pursue health care for
 
05:45:38.390 --> 05:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
their children and what are parents
 
05:45:40.250 --> 05:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
supposed to do in those situations in
 
05:45:43.190 --> 05:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
some situations Brave parents have stuck
 
05:45:45.530 --> 05:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
around and fought and we've you know my
 
05:45:47.208 --> 05:45:47.218 align:start position:0%
organizations involved in litigation in
 
05:45:49.610 --> 05:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
Alabama and other litigation has been
 
05:45:51.110 --> 05:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
going on across the country in states
 
05:45:52.670 --> 05:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
where they have been outlawing this kind
 
05:45:54.890 --> 05:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
of health care but other families who
 
05:45:57.590 --> 05:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
can't afford to be as Brave will leave
 
05:45:59.208 --> 05:45:59.218 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what a good parent
 
05:46:00.890 --> 05:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
would do when your doctor says this is
 
05:46:02.628 --> 05:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
the health care your child needs you
 
05:46:06.288 --> 05:46:06.298 align:start position:0%
leave and the the purpose of this bill
 
05:46:08.030 --> 05:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
and the wonderful benefit that it
 
05:46:09.590 --> 05:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
provides to families who are in this
 
05:46:12.288 --> 05:46:12.298 align:start position:0%
situation it doesn't say that the states
 
05:46:14.810 --> 05:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
can't continue to investigate uh you
 
05:46:17.030 --> 05:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
know and enforce their laws all it says
 
05:46:18.708 --> 05:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
is that New Hampshire isn't going to be
 
05:46:21.110 --> 05:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
complicit actively participating in that
 
05:46:23.208 --> 05:46:23.218 align:start position:0%
investigation into some of the questions
 
05:46:25.010 --> 05:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
that I heard earlier
 
05:46:25.020 --> 05:46:25.730 align:start position:0%
that I heard earlier
um

05:46:25.730 --> 05:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:28.310 --> 05:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
yes there are investigations that go
 
05:46:31.670 --> 05:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
beyond this the boundaries of a state
 
05:46:34.128 --> 05:46:34.138 align:start position:0%
um yes there are other examples where
 
05:46:35.810 --> 05:46:35.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire government does not take
 
05:46:37.368 --> 05:46:37.378 align:start position:0%
an active role in helping other states
 
05:46:38.830 --> 05:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
carry out their investigations
 
05:46:42.048 --> 05:46:42.058 align:start position:0%
conforming to their own laws and
 
05:46:45.288 --> 05:46:45.298 align:start position:0%
um also there was anyway I'm happy to
 
05:46:46.670 --> 05:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
take other questions it's just a really
 
05:46:48.110 --> 05:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
sensible piece of legislation that
 
05:46:50.270 --> 05:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
protects families oh I wanted to mention
 
05:46:52.070 --> 05:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
that people who
 
05:46:54.110 --> 05:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
um refer out so you heard from doctors
 
05:46:55.548 --> 05:46:55.558 align:start position:0%
today doctors who have ethical
 
05:46:57.230 --> 05:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
obligations to their patients they're
 
05:46:59.090 --> 05:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
not going to tell families no you can't
 
05:47:00.470 --> 05:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
retain health care anymore because our
 
05:47:02.030 --> 05:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
state outlawed it they're going to say
 
05:47:04.070 --> 05:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
let me help you find some way to get
 
05:47:05.390 --> 05:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
health care for your kid and that might
 
05:47:07.310 --> 05:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
mean going out of state
 
05:47:08.810 --> 05:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
does New Hampshire really want to
 
05:47:11.090 --> 05:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
actively participate in Prosecuting
 
05:47:12.830 --> 05:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
those practitioners who refer people to
 
05:47:14.570 --> 05:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
other states no of course not that's
 
05:47:16.070 --> 05:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
what this legislation ensures for
 
05:47:18.350 --> 05:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
families and um and I'm happy to take
 
05:47:18.360 --> 05:47:19.128 align:start position:0%
families and um and I'm happy to take
questions

05:47:19.128 --> 05:47:19.138 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:47:21.590 --> 05:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you questions
 
05:47:21.600 --> 05:47:23.690 align:start position:0%
thank you questions
gentlemen

05:47:23.690 --> 05:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
gentlemen
 
05:47:26.448 --> 05:47:26.458 align:start position:0%
yes representative McLean
 
05:47:28.128 --> 05:47:28.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:47:30.288 --> 05:47:30.298 align:start position:0%
taking my question so just getting you
 
05:47:32.208 --> 05:47:32.218 align:start position:0%
know to the case for need so what you're
 
05:47:35.628 --> 05:47:35.638 align:start position:0%
saying is that actually in Texas there
 
05:47:39.830 --> 05:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
has been active seeking of removal
 
05:47:39.840 --> 05:47:40.670 align:start position:0%
has been active seeking of removal
um

05:47:40.670 --> 05:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:43.548 --> 05:47:43.558 align:start position:0%
if a family has left the state to
 
05:47:46.368 --> 05:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
receive care right now currently the
 
05:47:48.890 --> 05:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
process has been enjoined by a court and
 
05:47:50.208 --> 05:47:50.218 align:start position:0%
I believe that injunction is still in
 
05:47:52.548 --> 05:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
place but what happened the day that the
 
05:47:54.948 --> 05:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
policy went through
 
05:47:57.470 --> 05:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
um an employee of department and
 
05:47:59.390 --> 05:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
Children and Family Services has a
 
05:48:00.890 --> 05:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
transgender kid it was known to other
 
05:48:04.548 --> 05:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
people in the um in in that department a
 
05:48:06.708 --> 05:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
staffer was sent to that person's home
 
05:48:08.930 --> 05:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
with the notice of investigation and
 
05:48:10.190 --> 05:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
that's when the lawsuit was filed that
 
05:48:12.170 --> 05:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
stopped it but if that lawsuit hadn't
 
05:48:13.430 --> 05:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
been filed and if the court hadn't
 
05:48:15.288 --> 05:48:15.298 align:start position:0%
enjoined the enforcement of it right now
 
05:48:16.788 --> 05:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
families would be under an investigation
 
05:48:18.470 --> 05:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
and that investigation would not be
 
05:48:20.990 --> 05:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
confined to the boundaries of Texas they
 
05:48:22.788 --> 05:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
would they would investigate to the
 
05:48:24.470 --> 05:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
extent that they wish to in that state
 
05:48:24.480 --> 05:48:26.750 align:start position:0%
extent that they wish to in that state
follow-up

05:48:26.750 --> 05:48:26.760 align:start position:0%

individual chosen to seek that care in
 
05:48:35.330 --> 05:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire then that is where this
 
05:48:37.310 --> 05:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
bill would come into play yes precisely
 
05:48:39.410 --> 05:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you yes and um
 
05:48:40.910 --> 05:48:40.920 align:start position:0%

05:48:51.350 --> 05:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
the outset
 
05:48:54.708 --> 05:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:56.570 --> 05:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:48:57.890 --> 05:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:49:01.208 --> 05:49:01.218 align:start position:0%
uh just to be clear isn't it true that
 
05:49:04.850 --> 05:49:04.860 align:start position:0%
dcyf in or their equivalent in other
 
05:49:04.860 --> 05:49:05.770 align:start position:0%
dcyf in or their equivalent in other
states

05:49:05.770 --> 05:49:05.780 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:49:09.170 --> 05:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
routinely go into other states to
 
05:49:14.530 --> 05:49:14.540 align:start position:0%
investigate circumstances that relate to
 
05:49:20.030 --> 05:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
a particular child who uh who who is
 
05:49:22.910 --> 05:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
or to investigate a parent who is under
 
05:49:25.128 --> 05:49:25.138 align:start position:0%
investigation for abuse or neglect of a
 
05:49:25.138 --> 05:49:25.850 align:start position:0%
investigation for abuse or neglect of a
child

05:49:25.850 --> 05:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
child
 
05:49:29.990 --> 05:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
yeah for sure for sure and um and uh I
 
05:49:31.310 --> 05:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
believe that the domestic violence
 
05:49:32.930 --> 05:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
provision actually addresses this kind
 
05:49:35.690 --> 05:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
of situation where where where nobody
 
05:49:37.670 --> 05:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
wants to impede the investigation of
 
05:49:39.650 --> 05:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
another state into instances of child
 
05:49:42.170 --> 05:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
abuse or instances of kidnapping which
 
05:49:44.868 --> 05:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
are common things unfortunately uh that
 
05:49:47.510 --> 05:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
that that that cross state lines
 
05:49:49.970 --> 05:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
um and all this bill is doing is saying
 
05:49:51.830 --> 05:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
when it comes to a parent who's seeking
 
05:49:54.048 --> 05:49:54.058 align:start position:0%
health care for their kids outside of a
 
05:49:56.330 --> 05:49:56.340 align:start position:0%
state where it's prohibited that New
 
05:49:57.410 --> 05:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not going to actively
 
05:50:00.770 --> 05:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
participate in um in in Prosecuting that
 
05:50:00.780 --> 05:50:03.410 align:start position:0%
participate in um in in Prosecuting that
crime

05:50:03.410 --> 05:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:06.288 --> 05:50:06.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:08.930 --> 05:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
okay I'm saying none thank you thank you
 
05:50:11.150 --> 05:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
the final person I have signed up to
 
05:50:13.610 --> 05:50:13.620 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 368 is Malachi
 
05:50:13.620 --> 05:50:17.030 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 368 is Malachi
Goodwin

05:50:17.030 --> 05:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:20.448 --> 05:50:20.458 align:start position:0%
I'm Malachi I'm 21. um I'm here to
 
05:50:22.730 --> 05:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
represent myself in both my trans
 
05:50:24.110 --> 05:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
girlfriend who couldn't make it I didn't
 
05:50:26.030 --> 05:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
write that on the letter thing but um
 
05:50:28.310 --> 05:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
I'm here for her as well
 
05:50:30.708 --> 05:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
so he mentioned the kidnapping because
 
05:50:32.448 --> 05:50:32.458 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna like really incubate that
 
05:50:34.430 --> 05:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
Florida like just introduced a bill that
 
05:50:39.230 --> 05:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
would allow parents to legally kidnap
 
05:50:40.970 --> 05:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
um you know break the custodial lines
 
05:50:44.150 --> 05:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
and kidnap a their trans kid
 
05:50:46.610 --> 05:50:46.620 align:start position:0%
um in case it's the idea of the
 
05:50:49.128 --> 05:50:49.138 align:start position:0%
possibility not even doing it the
 
05:50:51.470 --> 05:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
possibility of them receiving gender for
 
05:50:53.090 --> 05:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
my care they can kidnap their child
 
05:50:55.490 --> 05:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
across state lines as well
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
um so I wanted to put that in real fast
 
05:51:00.590 --> 05:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire's motto is live for
 
05:51:03.350 --> 05:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
your die in House Bill 368 will help
 
05:51:04.910 --> 05:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
trans people do just that as well as
 
05:51:06.770 --> 05:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
protect trans refugees across the
 
05:51:06.780 --> 05:51:07.510 align:start position:0%
protect trans refugees across the
country

05:51:07.510 --> 05:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:51:10.250 --> 05:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma is trying to ban all gender
 
05:51:12.288 --> 05:51:12.298 align:start position:0%
affirming care for all ages not even
 
05:51:14.150 --> 05:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
just trying to protect the children is
 
05:51:14.160 --> 05:51:15.128 align:start position:0%
just trying to protect the children is
all

05:51:15.128 --> 05:51:15.138 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:51:17.390 --> 05:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
other states such as Oregon Virginia
 
05:51:19.970 --> 05:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
Arkansas Indiana Washington Florida
 
05:51:21.830 --> 05:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
Mississippi South Dakota I can go on
 
05:51:23.810 --> 05:51:23.820 align:start position:0%
there's like 33 states that have
 
05:51:26.390 --> 05:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
introduced anti-trans bills in some way
 
05:51:30.350 --> 05:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire and that's sad
 
05:51:30.360 --> 05:51:31.430 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire and that's sad
um

05:51:31.430 --> 05:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:33.350 --> 05:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
all these states are trying to erase
 
05:51:35.030 --> 05:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
criminalize and ban the existence of
 
05:51:37.610 --> 05:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
trans people on the train Sanctuary bill
 
05:51:40.190 --> 05:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
is more important than ever Canada's
 
05:51:43.190 --> 05:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
even introduced a refugee bill for those
 
05:51:46.010 --> 05:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
who are fleeing their state to still be
 
05:51:48.410 --> 05:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
able to receive gender affirming care
 
05:51:48.420 --> 05:51:49.190 align:start position:0%
able to receive gender affirming care
um

05:51:49.190 --> 05:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:51.708 --> 05:51:51.718 align:start position:0%
you know trying to fleeing to avoid
 
05:51:55.070 --> 05:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
prosecution or loss of their rights
 
05:51:56.990 --> 05:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
um you know we can join Illinois and
 
05:52:00.048 --> 05:52:00.058 align:start position:0%
California in protecting a marginalized
 
05:52:03.410 --> 05:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
minority that's under genocide and has
 
05:52:07.010 --> 05:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
many many organizes many organizations
 
05:52:09.350 --> 05:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
agree that what is occurring is genocide
 
05:52:12.530 --> 05:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
is attempted modern genocide
 
05:52:12.540 --> 05:52:13.128 align:start position:0%
is attempted modern genocide
um

05:52:13.128 --> 05:52:13.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:16.250 --> 05:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
we need more protection than ever
 
05:52:18.590 --> 05:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
it's gender from care has shown time and
 
05:52:19.970 --> 05:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
time again through multiple different
 
05:52:21.288 --> 05:52:21.298 align:start position:0%
studies from
 
05:52:22.730 --> 05:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
different countries and different
 
05:52:24.288 --> 05:52:24.298 align:start position:0%
organizations proving that gender
 
05:52:26.030 --> 05:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
affirmative care does help
 
05:52:28.910 --> 05:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
and it reduces suicidal radiation
 
05:52:30.948 --> 05:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
increases quality of life I can say from
 
05:52:33.830 --> 05:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
my personal experience that coming I was
 
05:52:36.590 --> 05:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
suicidal and depressed anxious I had OCD
 
05:52:39.170 --> 05:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
before coming out and as I've been able
 
05:52:43.548 --> 05:52:43.558 align:start position:0%
to transition and be more who I am I am
 
05:52:46.310 --> 05:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
now in remission all my illnesses are in
 
05:52:49.128 --> 05:52:49.138 align:start position:0%
remission besides maybe my depression
 
05:52:51.530 --> 05:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
because this is the society that I live
 
05:52:54.070 --> 05:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
in it is scary I am scared
 
05:52:56.868 --> 05:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not certain that New Hampshire will
 
05:52:59.270 --> 05:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
come to it but you know I believe in us
 
05:53:01.788 --> 05:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
to not do that but it's scary I have
 
05:53:03.170 --> 05:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
trans friends that are fleeing their
 
05:53:05.208 --> 05:53:05.218 align:start position:0%
states I have I've known of many people
 
05:53:07.010 --> 05:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
being prosecuted
 
05:53:08.750 --> 05:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
forward trying to take care of
 
05:53:10.490 --> 05:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
themselves there's other states that are
 
05:53:11.990 --> 05:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
trying to ban the existence of trans
 
05:53:13.930 --> 05:53:13.940 align:start position:0%
people in public
 
05:53:17.448 --> 05:53:17.458 align:start position:0%
making it a felony
 
05:53:20.090 --> 05:53:20.100 align:start position:0%
we need to protect us like you have 15
 
05:53:22.310 --> 05:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
seconds please stop wrapping up it's
 
05:53:23.930 --> 05:53:23.940 align:start position:0%

I am here today to oppose HB 619.
 
05:55:19.430 --> 05:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
this bill among many other terrible
 
05:55:23.030 --> 05:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
things would ban gender affirmation in
 
05:55:23.040 --> 05:55:25.510 align:start position:0%
things would ban gender affirmation in
schools

05:55:25.510 --> 05:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:55:28.670 --> 05:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
I am in a high school and when my
 
05:55:31.548 --> 05:55:31.558 align:start position:0%
teachers make a point to use my correct
 
05:55:34.610 --> 05:55:34.620 align:start position:0%
pronouns and change their language to
 
05:55:37.490 --> 05:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
include me it makes me feel seen and
 
05:55:40.010 --> 05:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
loved and cared for
 
05:55:43.730 --> 05:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
but when this doesn't happen when they
 
05:55:47.868 --> 05:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
misgender me when they exclude me from
 
05:55:47.878 --> 05:55:49.128 align:start position:0%
misgender me when they exclude me from
their

05:55:49.128 --> 05:55:49.138 align:start position:0%

um
 
05:55:53.750 --> 05:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
language and when I can't go to the
 
05:55:57.470 --> 05:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
bathroom in a play in a public place I
 
05:56:00.110 --> 05:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
feel really terrible about myself and it
 
05:56:02.990 --> 05:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
really digs up my self-esteem
 
05:56:03.000 --> 05:56:04.788 align:start position:0%
really digs up my self-esteem
and

05:56:04.788 --> 05:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:56:04.798 --> 05:56:05.750 align:start position:0%

um
 
05:56:09.230 --> 05:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
all this to say gender affirmation in
 
05:56:11.930 --> 05:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
schools and in public in general is
 
05:56:15.288 --> 05:56:15.298 align:start position:0%
extremely important for Trans kids
 
05:56:17.470 --> 05:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
05:56:22.730 --> 05:56:22.740 align:start position:0%

05:56:26.750 --> 05:56:26.760 align:start position:0%

05:56:33.708 --> 05:56:33.718 align:start position:0%

good afternoon my name is Karen Leo Hill
 
05:56:49.788 --> 05:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
I am an 18-year City councilor in
 
05:56:52.190 --> 05:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and um
 
05:56:56.510 --> 05:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
most proudly I am the mom of Zoe
 
05:57:00.288 --> 05:57:00.298 align:start position:0%
I am here also to stand with my trans
 
05:57:04.128 --> 05:57:04.138 align:start position:0%
child and trans people across New
 
05:57:04.138 --> 05:57:05.628 align:start position:0%
child and trans people across New
Hampshire

05:57:05.628 --> 05:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:57:07.850 --> 05:57:07.860 align:start position:0%
um I'm very proud to come from a city
 
05:57:10.070 --> 05:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
where we have adopted an inclusiveness
 
05:57:13.670 --> 05:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
resolution we are a welcoming City and
 
05:57:17.628 --> 05:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
it is my hope that New Hampshire will be
 
05:57:21.230 --> 05:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
a welcoming State HB 619 flies in the
 
05:57:24.470 --> 05:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
values that we hold dear in Lebanon and
 
05:57:26.270 --> 05:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
that I believe we hold deer across the
 
05:57:30.288 --> 05:57:30.298 align:start position:0%
state and so I ask you to vote itl on
 
05:57:32.208 --> 05:57:32.218 align:start position:0%
this bill and I will add my personal
 
05:57:34.970 --> 05:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
perspective that
 
05:57:38.868 --> 05:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
when when we got a report card recently
 
05:57:41.990 --> 05:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
and Zoe's teachers made the point to use
 
05:57:43.850 --> 05:57:43.860 align:start position:0%
the correct pronoun
 
05:57:46.850 --> 05:57:46.860 align:start position:0%
I could see it in my child's face what
 
05:57:50.150 --> 05:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
it meant to be affirmed in that way and
 
05:57:52.910 --> 05:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
so even in my child who comes from a
 
05:57:55.730 --> 05:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
supportive welcoming home
 
05:57:59.448 --> 05:57:59.458 align:start position:0%
it makes a difference when schools
 
05:58:03.048 --> 05:58:03.058 align:start position:0%
are a safe place a welcoming place and
 
05:58:07.610 --> 05:58:07.620 align:start position:0%
so on behalf of all children across the
 
05:58:11.510 --> 05:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
state I ask you to vote itl on hb619
 
05:58:16.368 --> 05:58:16.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:25.010 --> 05:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:33.170 --> 05:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:42.590 --> 05:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:50.090 --> 05:58:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:54.650 --> 05:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
Lisa Norton McRae
 
05:58:54.660 --> 05:58:56.628 align:start position:0%
Lisa Norton McRae
okay

05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:59:00.110 --> 05:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:00.120 --> 05:59:05.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:59:05.150 --> 05:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:08.270 --> 05:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
after after this person it'll be Sam
 
05:59:08.280 --> 05:59:11.810 align:start position:0%
after after this person it'll be Sam
Hawkins

05:59:11.810 --> 05:59:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:14.690 --> 05:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Lisa Norton Mercado

friends who have spent quite a bit of
 
05:59:32.628 --> 05:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
time in my house I'm here to oppose this
 
05:59:36.590 --> 05:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
bill H.B 619 this is government
 
05:59:41.628 --> 05:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
overreach the government should not be
 
05:59:43.430 --> 05:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
dictating to people what to do with
 
05:59:44.590 --> 05:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
their bodies
 
05:59:48.948 --> 05:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
and to parents as to how to raise their
 
05:59:48.958 --> 05:59:50.750 align:start position:0%
and to parents as to how to raise their
children

05:59:50.750 --> 05:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:59:50.760 --> 05:59:52.548 align:start position:0%
children
um

05:59:52.548 --> 05:59:52.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:57.170 --> 05:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
this is in direct conflict with our
 
06:00:01.610 --> 06:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:03.830 --> 06:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
the age of consent in the state for many
 
06:00:07.788 --> 06:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
things is 16 and
 
06:00:10.548 --> 06:00:10.558 align:start position:0%
for some things it's even 14. you can
 
06:00:13.250 --> 06:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
get married at the age of 16 in this
 
06:00:15.948 --> 06:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
state major life decision
 
06:00:20.330 --> 06:00:20.340 align:start position:0%
you can have children and receive
 
06:00:23.930 --> 06:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
prenatal care without the consent of or
 
06:00:26.150 --> 06:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge of your parents at the age of
 
06:00:26.160 --> 06:00:27.350 align:start position:0%
knowledge of your parents at the age of
16.

06:00:27.350 --> 06:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
16.
 
06:00:27.360 --> 06:00:29.448 align:start position:0%
16.
okay

06:00:29.448 --> 06:00:29.458 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:00:33.048 --> 06:00:33.058 align:start position:0%
um with the approval of a judge you can
 
06:00:35.690 --> 06:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
even terminate our pregnancy
 
06:00:38.390 --> 06:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
without the consent or knowledge of your
 
06:00:38.400 --> 06:00:40.190 align:start position:0%
without the consent or knowledge of your
parents

06:00:40.190 --> 06:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
parents
 
06:00:44.030 --> 06:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
you can receive birth control
 
06:00:45.948 --> 06:00:45.958 align:start position:0%
without the consent or knowledge of your
 
06:00:48.770 --> 06:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
parent at the age of 14.
 
06:00:51.288 --> 06:00:51.298 align:start position:0%
so if we're saying
 
06:00:55.010 --> 06:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
that kids are old enough to make all of
 
06:00:57.770 --> 06:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
these major life decisions having
 
06:01:00.948 --> 06:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
children getting married
 
06:01:03.770 --> 06:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
terminating pregnancies
 
06:01:06.708 --> 06:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
then why can't they have gender
 
06:01:08.810 --> 06:01:08.820 align:start position:0%
affirming treatment
 
06:01:11.208 --> 06:01:11.218 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any sense there are
 
06:01:13.070 --> 06:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
people who have testified today saying
 
06:01:14.690 --> 06:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
oh they're so vulnerable their brains
 
06:01:16.490 --> 06:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
aren't developed yet they can't but
 
06:01:19.128 --> 06:01:19.138 align:start position:0%
we're letting them do these other things
 
06:01:21.530 --> 06:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
so if this bill passes when we have to
 
06:01:24.230 --> 06:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
change all those other laws
 
06:01:28.128 --> 06:01:28.138 align:start position:0%
at 17 you become can become emancipated
 
06:01:30.288 --> 06:01:30.298 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
06:01:35.570 --> 06:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:37.010 --> 06:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
there are a few people who have
 
06:01:38.628 --> 06:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
testified today that they have
 
06:01:38.638 --> 06:01:41.510 align:start position:0%
testified today that they have
detransitions

06:01:41.510 --> 06:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
detransitions
 
06:01:43.490 --> 06:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
and their stories are valid and they
 
06:01:45.650 --> 06:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
should be considered by the committee
 
06:01:48.410 --> 06:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
but we need to be careful that we're not
 
06:01:50.570 --> 06:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
going to wipe out the rights of an
 
06:01:53.810 --> 06:01:53.820 align:start position:0%
entire group of people because some
 
06:01:56.510 --> 06:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
people have chosen to detransition so
 
06:01:59.690 --> 06:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
please keep that in mind
 
06:02:03.230 --> 06:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
there's been talk about child abuse
 
06:02:06.970 --> 06:02:06.980 align:start position:0%
but isn't it child abuse to kick your
 
06:02:06.980 --> 06:02:08.770 align:start position:0%
but isn't it child abuse to kick your
translation

06:02:08.770 --> 06:02:08.780 align:start position:0%
translation
 
06:02:11.448 --> 06:02:11.458 align:start position:0%
yep out of your home
 
06:02:13.730 --> 06:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
and make them find another place to live
 
06:02:16.190 --> 06:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
when they're a minor because you don't
 
06:02:19.250 --> 06:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:22.250 --> 06:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
I want the committee to consider these
 
06:02:23.750 --> 06:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
things that I've said
 
06:02:27.170 --> 06:02:27.180 align:start position:0%

06:03:13.250 --> 06:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
so there's no confusion we also want to
 
06:03:14.990 --> 06:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
be clear that these increased rates of
 
06:03:16.490 --> 06:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
mental health symptoms are not
 
06:03:19.190 --> 06:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
inextricably linked with one's gender
 
06:03:22.310 --> 06:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
identity or sexual orientation rather as
 
06:03:23.690 --> 06:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
stated by the president of the American
 
06:03:26.208 --> 06:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
Medical Association it is quote the
 
06:03:28.250 --> 06:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
result of stigma discrimination and
 
06:03:30.650 --> 06:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
mistreatment with support at home school
 
06:03:32.990 --> 06:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
and in the community and with access to
 
06:03:35.330 --> 06:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care transgender youth
 
06:03:37.490 --> 06:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
do as well on Mental Health measures as

their non-transgender peers end quote
 
06:03:42.530 --> 06:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
access to gender affirming Medical Care
 
06:03:44.030 --> 06:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
is crucial to improve mental health
 
06:03:45.890 --> 06:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
outcomes for transgender and non-binary
 
06:03:48.048 --> 06:03:48.058 align:start position:0%
youth multiple studies show that gender
 
06:03:49.910 --> 06:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
affirming treatment has a significant
 
06:03:51.410 --> 06:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
association with lowered odds of
 
06:03:53.208 --> 06:03:53.218 align:start position:0%
depression and suicide attempts
 
06:03:55.070 --> 06:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
additionally access to Identity
 
06:03:56.570 --> 06:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
affirming spaces is one of the most
 
06:03:57.948 --> 06:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
significant ways to promote trans
 
06:04:01.070 --> 06:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
well-being and reduce suicidality in New
 
06:04:03.708 --> 06:04:03.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire only 18 percent of lgbtq Youth
 
06:04:05.390 --> 06:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
believe their community at large to be
 
06:04:08.030 --> 06:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
very accepting we expect this to worsen
 
06:04:10.128 --> 06:04:10.138 align:start position:0%
by the guidelines relating to schools in
 
06:04:11.090 --> 06:04:11.100 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:04:12.948 --> 06:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
finally Nami New Hampshire remains
 
06:04:14.510 --> 06:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
firmly opposed to the damaging practice
 
06:04:16.490 --> 06:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
of conversion therapy and believes that
 
06:04:17.990 --> 06:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
its prohibition and law must remain
 
06:04:20.750 --> 06:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
strict last year during testimony on a
 
06:04:22.310 --> 06:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
similar Bill we heard we heard
 
06:04:24.230 --> 06:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
repeatedly that conversion therapy does
 
06:04:26.208 --> 06:04:26.218 align:start position:0%
not happen in New Hampshire however
 
06:04:27.650 --> 06:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
recent data from the Trevor Project
 
06:04:29.990 --> 06:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
revealed that in 2022 in New Hampshire
 
06:04:33.048 --> 06:04:33.058 align:start position:0%
nine percent of lgbtq Youth surveyed
 
06:04:34.430 --> 06:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
reported being threatened with
 
06:04:36.288 --> 06:04:36.298 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy and four percent
 
06:04:39.190 --> 06:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
reported being subjected to it
 
06:04:41.868 --> 06:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
hb619 seeks to damage the livelihood of
 
06:04:43.490 --> 06:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
transgender and non-binary youth by
 
06:04:45.170 --> 06:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
restricting their access to life-saving
 
06:04:48.288 --> 06:04:48.298 align:start position:0%
care if put into law this bill will harm
 
06:04:50.690 --> 06:04:50.700 align:start position:0%
transgender non-binary youth in cost
 
06:04:50.700 --> 06:04:51.650 align:start position:0%
transgender non-binary youth in cost
lives

lives
 
06:04:53.090 --> 06:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
for those reasons Norman New Hampshire
 
06:04:55.010 --> 06:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
strongly urges the committee to vote in
 
06:04:57.350 --> 06:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate for HB 619 and
 
06:04:58.850 --> 06:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
take any questions

in different areas of the state and I
 
06:05:50.570 --> 06:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
just want to bring a few points up
 
06:05:51.948 --> 06:05:51.958 align:start position:0%
because you've heard a lot of testimony
 
06:05:55.010 --> 06:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
today we opposed this bill and there
 
06:05:56.750 --> 06:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
have been many people have spoken
 
06:05:58.730 --> 06:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
eloquently on why the bill should be
 
06:06:00.410 --> 06:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
opposed but I want to speak on a couple
 
06:06:02.628 --> 06:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
of things about the education portion of
 
06:06:04.670 --> 06:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
the bill that I want to make sure you
 
06:06:04.680 --> 06:06:05.628 align:start position:0%
the bill that I want to make sure you
understand

06:06:05.628 --> 06:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
understand
 
06:06:08.810 --> 06:06:08.820 align:start position:0%
you know as teachers as human beings as
 
06:06:10.610 --> 06:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
professionals covered by the code of
 
06:06:10.620 --> 06:06:11.810 align:start position:0%
professionals covered by the code of
conduct

06:06:11.810 --> 06:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
06:06:14.930 --> 06:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
we are required
 
06:06:20.448 --> 06:06:20.458 align:start position:0%
and frankly you know we really there's
 
06:06:22.190 --> 06:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
no other way to operate we treat all our
 
06:06:24.708 --> 06:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
students with respect that is something
 
06:06:29.810 --> 06:06:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:34.368 --> 06:06:34.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:38.930 --> 06:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
this bill would require us to treat a
 
06:06:42.590 --> 06:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
segment of our students disrespectfully
 
06:06:44.628 --> 06:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
and discriminate against them
 
06:06:46.788 --> 06:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
that's what you're asking us to do and
 
06:06:48.650 --> 06:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
you'll be asking us to violate our code
 
06:06:50.690 --> 06:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
of conduct to follow this bill if you
 
06:06:52.430 --> 06:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
pass it
 
06:06:57.150 --> 06:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
so we could be in danger of
 
06:06:57.160 --> 06:06:57.650 align:start position:0%
so we could be in danger of
[Music]

06:06:57.650 --> 06:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:06:57.660 --> 06:06:58.548 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

06:06:58.548 --> 06:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:01.010 --> 06:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
losing our job or having disciplinary
 
06:07:03.650 --> 06:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
action taken against us if we followed
 
06:07:09.288 --> 06:07:09.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:12.470 --> 06:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:14.090 --> 06:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
because we would be disrespecting our
 
06:07:16.430 --> 06:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
students well we could be in danger if
 
06:07:17.750 --> 06:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't disrespect the students
 
06:07:19.548 --> 06:07:19.558 align:start position:0%
because then parents could be final in
 
06:07:21.708 --> 06:07:21.718 align:start position:0%
complaints against us for violating the
 
06:07:23.750 --> 06:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
bill so you put us in a horrible
 
06:07:26.570 --> 06:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
situation besides just the fact that we
 
06:07:29.208 --> 06:07:29.218 align:start position:0%
need to build respectful relationships
 
06:07:30.948 --> 06:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
in the classroom with our students
 
06:07:33.830 --> 06:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
because students do not learn if they do
 
06:07:37.970 --> 06:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
not feel safe and welcome and accepted
 
06:07:40.010 --> 06:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
no student is going to learn at a place
 
06:07:41.448 --> 06:07:41.458 align:start position:0%
where they feel unsafe that's just
 
06:07:43.670 --> 06:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
Maslow's hierarchy of needs
 
06:07:45.890 --> 06:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get any education
 
06:07:49.810 --> 06:07:49.820 align:start position:0%
done if they are always worried about
 
06:07:52.670 --> 06:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
am I okay here am I going to be teased
 
06:07:54.470 --> 06:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be bullied um what's going
 
06:07:56.150 --> 06:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
to happen next if you're not going to
 
06:07:57.288 --> 06:07:57.298 align:start position:0%
let us get to that if you're going to
 
06:07:58.850 --> 06:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
force it to be disrespectful to our
 
06:08:01.850 --> 06:08:01.860 align:start position:0%
students and discriminate against them
 
06:08:05.208 --> 06:08:05.218 align:start position:0%
education cannot happen so we are urging
 
06:08:07.070 --> 06:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
you to
 
06:08:09.708 --> 06:08:09.718 align:start position:0%
about this bill in expedient to
 
06:08:13.430 --> 06:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislate and certainly you should not
 
06:08:16.010 --> 06:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
be forcing us to choose between
 
06:08:19.730 --> 06:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
discriminating against our students or
 
06:08:21.530 --> 06:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
losing our jobs
 
06:08:23.628 --> 06:08:23.638 align:start position:0%
those are horrible choices thank you
 
06:08:26.570 --> 06:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
yeah any questions
 
06:08:29.990 --> 06:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:32.270 --> 06:08:32.280 align:start position:0%

that we're not that it matters um that
 
06:09:48.830 --> 06:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a compelling government
 
06:09:50.448 --> 06:09:50.458 align:start position:0%
interest in protecting the health and
 
06:09:51.948 --> 06:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
safety of its citizens especially
 
06:09:54.410 --> 06:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children and I'd argue that
 
06:09:56.690 --> 06:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
and it's I'd say it's almost proven that
 
06:09:58.070 --> 06:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
trans children are one of the most
 
06:10:00.590 --> 06:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
vulnerable groups of kids and this bills
 
06:10:02.330 --> 06:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
would make that worse
 
06:10:03.890 --> 06:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not going to throw a bunch of
 
06:10:05.690 --> 06:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
Statistics out that other people have
 
06:10:07.610 --> 06:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
already thrown out but just know that I
 
06:10:08.628 --> 06:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
do stand
 
06:10:09.948 --> 06:10:09.958 align:start position:0%
um with the majority of the medical
 
06:10:11.510 --> 06:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
community and saying that conversion
 
06:10:13.128 --> 06:10:13.138 align:start position:0%
therapy saves a lot not conversion
 
06:10:15.230 --> 06:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
therapy sorry gender affirming Care
 
06:10:17.628 --> 06:10:17.638 align:start position:0%
Health Care saves lives and is effective
 
06:10:20.090 --> 06:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
and is overall very helpful and a good
 
06:10:22.610 --> 06:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
resource the Trevor report which someone
 
06:10:25.310 --> 06:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
had mentioned before but a 2021 survey
 
06:10:28.430 --> 06:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
of the national Trevor report said that
 
06:10:30.708 --> 06:10:30.718 align:start position:0%
94 reported that recent politics
 
06:10:33.170 --> 06:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
negatively impacted their Mental Health
 
06:10:35.990 --> 06:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
and the and then the state report for
 
06:10:38.750 --> 06:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
2022 also by the Trevor by the Trevor
 
06:10:42.190 --> 06:10:42.200 align:start position:0%
report in New Hampshire said that
 
06:10:46.190 --> 06:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
37 of Tran of lgbtq Youth said that
 
06:10:48.410 --> 06:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
recent policies recent politics
 
06:10:50.510 --> 06:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
negatively impacted their well-being and
 
06:10:52.850 --> 06:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
43 which is the highest percentage in
 
06:10:54.650 --> 06:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
this poll said that it impacted their
 
06:10:56.410 --> 06:10:56.420 align:start position:0%
well-being a lot
 
06:10:59.868 --> 06:10:59.878 align:start position:0%
and it and these are
 
06:11:01.788 --> 06:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
and as well as harmful being harmful
 
06:11:03.770 --> 06:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
this bill also
 
06:11:05.150 --> 06:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
I know that other people had mentioned
 
06:11:06.890 --> 06:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
the statistics
 
06:11:08.628 --> 06:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
that you let that you list and I think
 
06:11:11.030 --> 06:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
we know where that is on that first page
 
06:11:13.368 --> 06:11:13.378 align:start position:0%
um saying that it's you know for the
 
06:11:13.378 --> 06:11:15.650 align:start position:0%
um saying that it's you know for the
0.005

06:11:15.650 --> 06:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
0.005
 
06:11:18.530 --> 06:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
um if you actually look in that study
 
06:11:20.448 --> 06:11:20.458 align:start position:0%
um which the name of it is I can
 
06:11:22.570 --> 06:11:22.580 align:start position:0%
actually read that off is um
 
06:11:25.010 --> 06:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
the gender dysphoria on adults an
 
06:11:27.230 --> 06:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
overview and primer for psychiatrists if
 
06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
you go that's that is taken from the
 
06:11:30.830 --> 06:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
epidemiology section looking at the
 
06:11:33.590 --> 06:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
history of trans people in transness as
 
06:11:37.070 --> 06:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
a societal phenomenon and it a couple
 
06:11:38.930 --> 06:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
seconds a couple sentences later in that
 
06:11:40.788 --> 06:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
report it says the quote that this
 
06:11:42.350 --> 06:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
statistic does not reflect the
 
06:11:43.670 --> 06:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
prevalence of all individuals with
 
06:11:45.410 --> 06:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria or who identifies
 
06:11:47.810 --> 06:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
transgender and to this conclusion of
 
06:11:50.570 --> 06:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
that same study says that mental health
 
06:11:52.490 --> 06:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
professionals must fully appreciate that
 
06:11:53.750 --> 06:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
the focus of treatment for gender
 
06:11:56.270 --> 06:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
dysphoria is on the dysphoria not the
 
06:11:57.708 --> 06:11:57.718 align:start position:0%
gender identity
 
06:11:59.690 --> 06:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
and I just think that this
 
06:12:02.628 --> 06:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
misinformation is dangerous and
 
06:12:05.390 --> 06:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
the idea that trans that this kind of
 
06:12:07.610 --> 06:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
ideas are prevalent in our schools is
 
06:12:12.770 --> 06:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
simply untrue I myself am non-binary and
 
06:12:15.048 --> 06:12:15.058 align:start position:0%
I have and not a single person that
 
06:12:16.670 --> 06:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
works with me in the school district and
 
06:12:18.410 --> 06:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
especially none of the children that
 
06:12:20.208 --> 06:12:20.218 align:start position:0%
I've the many hundreds of children that
 
06:12:22.368 --> 06:12:22.378 align:start position:0%
I've you know substitute taught for know
 
06:12:24.650 --> 06:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
that because I consistently misgender
 
06:12:24.660 --> 06:12:25.670 align:start position:0%
that because I consistently misgender
myself

06:12:25.670 --> 06:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
myself
 
06:12:29.090 --> 06:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
and not because I am not wrapping up you
 
06:12:31.730 --> 06:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
start wrapping up yeah no it's um yeah
 
06:12:34.730 --> 06:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
and I trust me these kids are scared I
 
06:12:35.750 --> 06:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
am deliberately making myself
 
06:12:37.490 --> 06:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable and misgendering myself
 
06:12:40.190 --> 06:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
because I already fear the consequences
 
06:12:43.128 --> 06:12:43.138 align:start position:0%
of telling the child of telling the kids
 
06:12:44.750 --> 06:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
what I identify as so it's not about
 
06:12:47.390 --> 06:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
medical things it's it's nothing this
 
06:12:49.368 --> 06:12:49.378 align:start position:0%
builds beyond that it's part of the a
 
06:12:52.128 --> 06:12:52.138 align:start position:0%
rhetoric that's harmful to everyone and
 
06:12:53.990 --> 06:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
is stopping people not from getting
 
06:12:57.110 --> 06:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
medical care or doing medical things but
 
06:12:58.970 --> 06:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that stops people that
 
06:13:00.530 --> 06:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow people to be themselves in
 
06:13:04.310 --> 06:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:07.010 --> 06:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
06:13:10.010 --> 06:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions thank you
 
06:13:14.030 --> 06:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
next signed up to speak is Ariel Moore
 
06:13:20.448 --> 06:13:20.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:31.368 --> 06:13:31.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:37.910 --> 06:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:43.070 --> 06:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:46.070 --> 06:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
I again still representing myself and my
 
06:13:46.080 --> 06:13:46.850 align:start position:0%
I again still representing myself and my
girlfriend

06:13:46.850 --> 06:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
girlfriend
 
06:13:46.860 --> 06:13:47.930 align:start position:0%
girlfriend
um

06:13:47.930 --> 06:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:49.850 --> 06:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
earlier we heard someone mention how if
 
06:13:52.190 --> 06:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
you encourage an anorexic you know they
 
06:13:54.230 --> 06:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
die if you encourage an anorex if they
 
06:13:56.330 --> 06:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
die if you encourage transition they get
 
06:13:59.090 --> 06:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
so fulfilled living they get to they get
 
06:14:01.670 --> 06:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
to have a fulfilling life
 
06:14:04.970 --> 06:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
um if it's you know oh like that's the
 
06:14:06.770 --> 06:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
medical you have to you're paying into
 
06:14:08.810 --> 06:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
the medical for life just go to therapy
 
06:14:11.330 --> 06:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
I went to therapy for seven years and it
 
06:14:13.670 --> 06:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
didn't really do anything if I went with
 
06:14:15.890 --> 06:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
that path I'd be spending money on drugs
 
06:14:17.868 --> 06:14:17.878 align:start position:0%
that didn't help and therapy spending
 
06:14:19.850 --> 06:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
hundreds of dollars on that for years
 
06:14:22.850 --> 06:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
for forever because it didn't help but
 
06:14:24.830 --> 06:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
now that I have the care I need I don't
 
06:14:27.230 --> 06:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
need to spend as much to do it I mean I
 
06:14:29.330 --> 06:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
still spend a little but nowhere near
 
06:14:31.730 --> 06:14:31.740 align:start position:0%
the amount that I was spending before
 
06:14:33.948 --> 06:14:33.958 align:start position:0%
um mostly my biggest issue with this
 
06:14:35.208 --> 06:14:35.218 align:start position:0%
thing is
 
06:14:37.430 --> 06:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
the complete Erasure of intersex people
 
06:14:40.190 --> 06:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
and how this explicitly allows General
 
06:14:42.890 --> 06:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
mutilations on intersex babies despite
 
06:14:44.570 --> 06:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
it being
 
06:14:47.030 --> 06:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
um the title being sorry give me a
 
06:14:49.548 --> 06:14:49.558 align:start position:0%
second protection against child and
 
06:14:51.230 --> 06:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
medical psychological experimentation
 
06:14:51.240 --> 06:14:52.310 align:start position:0%
medical psychological experimentation
Act

06:14:52.310 --> 06:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
Act
 
06:14:55.010 --> 06:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
surgeries on infants is exactly that
 
06:14:57.110 --> 06:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
they and someone else mentioned how
 
06:15:00.470 --> 06:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
earlier in support of it I sounded like
 
06:15:02.628 --> 06:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
saying how oh they have to choose one or
 
06:15:04.490 --> 06:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
the other no they don't
 
06:15:06.350 --> 06:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
studies show that forcing intersex
 
06:15:09.110 --> 06:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
babies to have these surgeries
 
06:15:11.510 --> 06:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
does exactly what happens trans kids who
 
06:15:14.030 --> 06:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
don't get to live their life it causes
 
06:15:16.690 --> 06:15:16.700 align:start position:0%
sexual dysfunction a proven
 
06:15:19.788 --> 06:15:19.798 align:start position:0%
and overall psychological distress they
 
06:15:22.010 --> 06:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
have to go to therapy because they rely
 
06:15:23.868 --> 06:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
to by their parents
 
06:15:26.930 --> 06:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
um also New Hampshire legally recognizes
 
06:15:30.530 --> 06:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
other sexes we just had someone who's a
 
06:15:32.810 --> 06:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
teacher oh how are they gonna they
 
06:15:34.310 --> 06:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
I don't really have any words for that
 
06:15:35.990 --> 06:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
because I was kind of taken aback by
 
06:15:38.390 --> 06:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
that because I was going to mention that
 
06:15:40.430 --> 06:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
um there's also the use of disorders of
 
06:15:42.548 --> 06:15:42.558 align:start position:0%
sexual development within this and
 
06:15:44.810 --> 06:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
that's not what's used by the medical
 
06:15:47.510 --> 06:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
society they prefer differences because
 
06:15:49.430 --> 06:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
saying disorder is saying that they are
 
06:15:52.128 --> 06:15:52.138 align:start position:0%
in the wrong body this bill supports the
 
06:15:53.930 --> 06:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
idea that intersex babies are born in
 
06:15:56.690 --> 06:15:56.700 align:start position:0%
the wrong body despite it saying that
 
06:15:59.208 --> 06:15:59.218 align:start position:0%
kid you know you get what I'm trying to
 
06:16:01.730 --> 06:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
say sorry I'm really anxious
 
06:16:01.740 --> 06:16:02.448 align:start position:0%
say sorry I'm really anxious
um

06:16:02.448 --> 06:16:02.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:05.750 --> 06:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
over 70 of intersex people say that
 
06:16:07.850 --> 06:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
being called disordered
 
06:16:10.430 --> 06:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
gives them psychological distress they
 
06:16:12.048 --> 06:16:12.058 align:start position:0%
aren't disordered we're born like this
 
06:16:14.628 --> 06:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
there's over 20 000 people in New
 
06:16:16.548 --> 06:16:16.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are intersex that would
 
06:16:18.830 --> 06:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
be if in the legal gray area due to this
 
06:16:18.840 --> 06:16:20.448 align:start position:0%
be if in the legal gray area due to this
bill

06:16:20.448 --> 06:16:20.458 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:16:23.448 --> 06:16:23.458 align:start position:0%
um in it
 
06:16:25.548 --> 06:16:25.558 align:start position:0%
if Earth it just further stigmatizes
 
06:16:28.310 --> 06:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
that that the government does believe
 
06:16:30.590 --> 06:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
that there are babies born in the wrong
 
06:16:33.770 --> 06:16:33.780 align:start position:0%
body and that they must be surgically
 
06:16:36.410 --> 06:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
forced into the unnatural categories
 
06:16:38.570 --> 06:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
that we have created that we're just
 
06:16:41.708 --> 06:16:41.718 align:start position:0%
genetic screw-ups and mutilated and
 
06:16:44.448 --> 06:16:44.458 align:start position:0%
mutated all things I've heard to
 
06:16:46.250 --> 06:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
describe myself
 
06:16:46.260 --> 06:16:47.208 align:start position:0%
describe myself
um

06:16:47.208 --> 06:16:47.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:49.128 --> 06:16:49.138 align:start position:0%
20 000 people in New Hampshire how what
 
06:16:52.310 --> 06:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:55.368 --> 06:16:55.378 align:start position:0%
stop wrapping up your testimony please
 
06:16:57.288 --> 06:16:57.298 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's kind of all I have to
 
06:16:59.750 --> 06:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
say is that this bill is against
 
06:17:02.628 --> 06:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
um mutilations of sexual kinds while
 
06:17:04.970 --> 06:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
explicitly allowing it and I think
 
06:17:06.708 --> 06:17:06.718 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit hypocritical thank
 
06:17:08.628 --> 06:17:08.638 align:start position:0%
you for listening to me again okay thank
 
06:17:08.638 --> 06:17:11.990 align:start position:0%
you for listening to me again okay thank
you

06:17:11.990 --> 06:17:12.000 align:start position:0%

Michelle silly foisy
 
06:17:29.750 --> 06:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:31.670 --> 06:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chair and committee
 
06:17:34.010 --> 06:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
members my name is Michelle salifoise
 
06:17:36.170 --> 06:17:36.180 align:start position:0%
and I live in Temple I am here to ask
 
06:17:38.930 --> 06:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
you to oppose HB 619
 
06:17:41.270 --> 06:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
I am a mom of six children from the ages
 
06:17:44.208 --> 06:17:44.218 align:start position:0%
of 5 to 27. as a parent I strongly
 
06:17:46.730 --> 06:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
believe that taking control of my
 
06:17:48.650 --> 06:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
children's bodies and removing them
 
06:17:51.288 --> 06:17:51.298 align:start position:0%
their bodily autonomy is wrong
 
06:17:53.150 --> 06:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
I feel as a parent it is my
 
06:17:55.490 --> 06:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
responsibility to support my children in
 
06:17:57.110 --> 06:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
the pursuit of their dreams and their
 
06:17:58.368 --> 06:17:58.378 align:start position:0%
happiest life
 
06:18:00.230 --> 06:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
I did not become a parent to control
 
06:18:02.990 --> 06:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
their path and their future only to love
 
06:18:04.910 --> 06:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
them unconditionally and care for them
 
06:18:06.530 --> 06:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
with no bounds
 
06:18:08.208 --> 06:18:08.218 align:start position:0%
I would like to share a quote from a
 
06:18:11.330 --> 06:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
fellow mom Adrian Robin Robbins who is a
 
06:18:12.948 --> 06:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
lifelong New Hampshire resident in
 
06:18:12.958 --> 06:18:13.970 align:start position:0%
lifelong New Hampshire resident in
Temple

06:18:13.970 --> 06:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
Temple
 
06:18:18.128 --> 06:18:18.138 align:start position:0%
in her words I urge you to oppose HB 619
 
06:18:21.170 --> 06:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
my child came out as transgender when
 
06:18:23.510 --> 06:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
she was 16 years old and I have no doubt
 
06:18:25.490 --> 06:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
that she would be a suicide statistic
 
06:18:27.770 --> 06:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
without the gender affirming care that
 
06:18:31.070 --> 06:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
she received today she is an a thriving
 
06:18:34.070 --> 06:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
19 year old she is happier than she has
 
06:18:36.048 --> 06:18:36.058 align:start position:0%
ever been with a job and a great group
 
06:18:37.490 --> 06:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
of friends
 
06:18:39.590 --> 06:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
our family placed our trust in the
 
06:18:41.390 --> 06:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
medical professionals helping my child
 
06:18:44.090 --> 06:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
with her transition my child is alive
 
06:18:46.970 --> 06:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
and happy today because of that
 
06:18:49.970 --> 06:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
I ask you to please oppose this bill so
 
06:18:51.770 --> 06:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
that other children have the chance to
 
06:18:51.780 --> 06:18:52.788 align:start position:0%
that other children have the chance to
thrive

06:18:52.788 --> 06:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
thrive
 
06:18:56.750 --> 06:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
please I urge you to oppose HB 619 thank
 
06:18:58.910 --> 06:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
you for listening to my testimony thank
 
06:19:02.990 --> 06:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:08.030 --> 06:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:10.670 --> 06:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
yes sorry for the uh kind of uh camp
 
06:19:12.650 --> 06:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
counselor enthusiasm I see a lot of
 
06:19:14.208 --> 06:19:14.218 align:start position:0%
tired faces and I kind of wish I could
 
06:19:15.708 --> 06:19:15.718 align:start position:0%
do an Energizer but I'm going to stick
 
06:19:20.230 --> 06:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:23.990 --> 06:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
all right so I'll keep it quick and
 
06:19:25.810 --> 06:19:25.820 align:start position:0%
simple I oppose
 
06:19:28.670 --> 06:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
hb619 I work in the field of prevention
 
06:19:30.830 --> 06:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire and
 
06:19:32.270 --> 06:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
have been involved in this work ever
 
06:19:34.430 --> 06:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
since I was a teenager myself in middle
 
06:19:37.548 --> 06:19:37.558 align:start position:0%
school back in 2001. proudly I've lived
 
06:19:39.048 --> 06:19:39.058 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire my whole life except
 
06:19:42.110 --> 06:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
for my college Years and as have the
 
06:19:44.150 --> 06:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
eight generations of my family before me
 
06:19:46.970 --> 06:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
and part of that Legacy is the level of
 
06:19:49.070 --> 06:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
small town community I have experienced
 
06:19:51.590 --> 06:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
my whole life I was raised to be a Good
 
06:19:53.868 --> 06:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
Samaritan and spent most of my youth
 
06:19:55.788 --> 06:19:55.798 align:start position:0%
volunteering and doing right by my
 
06:19:55.798 --> 06:19:56.990 align:start position:0%
volunteering and doing right by my
communities

06:19:56.990 --> 06:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
communities
 
06:19:59.270 --> 06:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
prevention often leads people to think
 
06:20:01.310 --> 06:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
of just whether or not children use
 
06:20:03.770 --> 06:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
drugs tobacco and Other Drugs but it's
 
06:20:06.230 --> 06:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
also Suicide Prevention and building
 
06:20:08.690 --> 06:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
Community is the root of all prevention
 
06:20:11.810 --> 06:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
that we do here in the state and Beyond
 
06:20:14.868 --> 06:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years I have witnessed year
 
06:20:17.270 --> 06:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
after year of what being open with who
 
06:20:19.548 --> 06:20:19.558 align:start position:0%
you are can do for creating youth
 
06:20:22.190 --> 06:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
leadership joy and connectedness in
 
06:20:24.890 --> 06:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
communities all over the state teens
 
06:20:26.868 --> 06:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
that attend our programs take advantage
 
06:20:29.690 --> 06:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
of our safe community space to express
 
06:20:32.810 --> 06:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
their authentic selves for which many
 
06:20:35.270 --> 06:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
include gender expression different than
 
06:20:37.070 --> 06:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
what they were assigned at Birth
 
06:20:39.948 --> 06:20:39.958 align:start position:0%
and after over 20 years in the field I
 
06:20:42.708 --> 06:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
have seen teens of all genders CIS and
 
06:20:45.650 --> 06:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
trans and non-binary discuss their
 
06:20:48.410 --> 06:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
experiences and traumas in safe spaces
 
06:20:51.288 --> 06:20:51.298 align:start position:0%
and what the root causes are of why they
 
06:20:53.570 --> 06:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
feel disconnected and isolated from
 
06:20:55.788 --> 06:20:55.798 align:start position:0%
their families and communities being
 
06:20:58.868 --> 06:20:58.878 align:start position:0%
misunderstood neglected abused
 
06:21:02.150 --> 06:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
mistrusted are all a part of it being
 
06:21:04.730 --> 06:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
affirmed of trans and non-binary
 
06:21:07.490 --> 06:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
identities is not one of those traumas
 
06:21:09.048 --> 06:21:09.058 align:start position:0%
that I hear about
 
06:21:11.690 --> 06:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
additionally affirming these children
 
06:21:14.990 --> 06:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
and teens that trans or non-binary bring
 
06:21:17.810 --> 06:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
about some of the best leaders I've come
 
06:21:20.090 --> 06:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
to know because there is nothing braver
 
06:21:22.250 --> 06:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
to live as your authentic self in the
 
06:21:24.770 --> 06:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
face of hateful rhetoric and bills such
 
06:21:27.350 --> 06:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
as this and that inspires and uplifts
 
06:21:29.690 --> 06:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
people from all walks of life with all
 
06:21:31.250 --> 06:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
different experiences and struggles
 
06:21:33.948 --> 06:21:33.958 align:start position:0%
regardless of gender additionally please
 
06:21:36.890 --> 06:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
know that I hear and internalize all of
 
06:21:39.170 --> 06:21:39.180 align:start position:0%
the experiences I heard today and
 
06:21:41.330 --> 06:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
believe care should be nuanced and leave
 
06:21:43.788 --> 06:21:43.798 align:start position:0%
options open for shifts in self-identity
 
06:21:46.610 --> 06:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
as one grows older but outlying all
 
06:21:48.770 --> 06:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care for those under 18
 
06:21:51.770 --> 06:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
only dissolves that trust cuts out
 
06:21:54.410 --> 06:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
necessary resources and leads to Greater
 
06:21:56.390 --> 06:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
isolation and harm thank you for your
 
06:22:01.490 --> 06:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:04.490 --> 06:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
next step to speak is Kate West
 
06:22:11.868 --> 06:22:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:19.250 --> 06:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:22.610 --> 06:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
Allison Yeager hello I'm checking stock
 
06:22:26.150 --> 06:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:28.368 --> 06:22:28.378 align:start position:0%
I strongly oppose this bill and I would
 
06:22:30.048 --> 06:22:30.058 align:start position:0%
love to tell you some more about why
 
06:22:31.610 --> 06:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
why so one of the things that I think
 
06:22:33.288 --> 06:22:33.298 align:start position:0%
hasn't been touched on quite enough in
 
06:22:35.270 --> 06:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
the discussion of this bill is the
 
06:22:37.070 --> 06:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
reinstating of conversion therapy and
 
06:22:38.868 --> 06:22:38.878 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lot of supporters talking
 
06:22:40.430 --> 06:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
about following the science and how
 
06:22:42.650 --> 06:22:42.660 align:start position:0%
there isn't enough science to talk to
 
06:22:44.270 --> 06:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
show that gender affirmative care really
 
06:22:45.708 --> 06:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
is life-saving or that doesn't really
 
06:22:48.350 --> 06:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have long-term effects but
 
06:22:49.970 --> 06:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
what we do know is the damage of
 
06:22:52.128 --> 06:22:52.138 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy if you go and just
 
06:22:55.070 --> 06:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
Google convert conversion therapy PubMed
 
06:22:57.470 --> 06:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
PDF to really just filter out all of the
 
06:22:59.090 --> 06:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
negative results I found at least 17
 
06:23:01.310 --> 06:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
just on page one sitting in this room
 
06:23:02.868 --> 06:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
right now
 
06:23:05.628 --> 06:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
um and speaking for my mother who's a
 
06:23:07.430 --> 06:23:07.440 align:start position:0%

with an agenda against trans Health Care
 
06:23:19.788 --> 06:23:19.798 align:start position:0%
agrees that trans affirming care
 
06:23:21.470 --> 06:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
including for youth which is not the
 
06:23:22.910 --> 06:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
dramatic things that are laid out in
 
06:23:25.368 --> 06:23:25.378 align:start position:0%
that bill that highly scare mongering
 
06:23:27.288 --> 06:23:27.298 align:start position:0%
the situation they're not just handing
 
06:23:28.850 --> 06:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
out surgeries like that believe me I
 
06:23:31.670 --> 06:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
wish they were for my own sake

specifically to push one particular idea

of course are going to push the idea

that they were founded to suggest
 
06:23:57.470 --> 06:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
um going over some statistics again 85

percent of transgender and non-binary

say that recent laws just about these

debates having these debates whether
 
06:24:07.430 --> 06:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
these laws are passed or not of which
 
06:24:09.110 --> 06:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
there have been hundreds introduced just
 
06:24:11.868 --> 06:24:11.878 align:start position:0%
in this year of 2023 significantly
 
06:24:15.170 --> 06:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
impact their Mental Health 52 percent of
 
06:24:16.610 --> 06:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
trans and non-binary youth seriously
 
06:24:18.170 --> 06:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
considered suicide in the last year and
 
06:24:20.090 --> 06:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
one in five attempted
 
06:24:23.750 --> 06:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
I was one of those when it was me
 
06:24:26.510 --> 06:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
36 of lgbtq Youth reported that being
 
06:24:28.430 --> 06:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
physically threatened or reported being
 
06:24:29.628 --> 06:24:29.638 align:start position:0%
physically threatened or harmed due to
 
06:24:31.010 --> 06:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
their sexual orientation or gender
 
06:24:32.150 --> 06:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
identity something that would be
 
06:24:34.910 --> 06:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
worsened if schools are not allowed or
 
06:24:37.610 --> 06:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
not permitted to teach anti-hate when I
 
06:24:40.250 --> 06:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
was in school and I faced bullying based
 
06:24:44.090 --> 06:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
on my race our teachers took the time to
 
06:24:46.010 --> 06:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
teach everybody about racial differences
 
06:24:47.510 --> 06:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
to teach things about cultural
 
06:24:49.910 --> 06:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
differences to try to protect me to try
 
06:24:51.948 --> 06:24:51.958 align:start position:0%
to protect other students this bill
 
06:24:53.628 --> 06:24:53.638 align:start position:0%
would remove that protection from trans
 
06:24:55.910 --> 06:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
students to say teachers cannot speak up
 
06:24:57.410 --> 06:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
against these bullies and they are
 
06:24:59.628 --> 06:24:59.638 align:start position:0%
prohibited from doing so
 
06:25:02.270 --> 06:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
in fact teachers are required to be part
 
06:25:04.490 --> 06:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
of the bullying themselves which is
 
06:25:05.510 --> 06:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
something that is completely
 
06:25:08.868 --> 06:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
unacceptable in every other field
 
06:25:12.410 --> 06:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
use it just using I have a close family
 
06:25:15.170 --> 06:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
friend who's 12 and is trans and seeing
 
06:25:17.390 --> 06:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
the smile on his face just when I use
 
06:25:19.670 --> 06:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
this pronouns correctly makes everything
 
06:25:21.470 --> 06:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
worth it makes it worth it to be here
 
06:25:22.788 --> 06:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
today and hear all the hate that I've
 
06:25:24.350 --> 06:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
heard today
 
06:25:30.548 --> 06:25:30.558 align:start position:0%
finally I want to address the uh
 
06:25:33.288 --> 06:25:33.298 align:start position:0%
issues of
 
06:25:34.788 --> 06:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
um all the sphere mongering about this
 
06:25:36.410 --> 06:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
being like a mass system and that
 
06:25:37.670 --> 06:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
everyone is talking about how to talk
 
06:25:40.010 --> 06:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
kids into care so I'm on Tick Tock
 
06:25:41.510 --> 06:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
because I'm an educator and I'd like to
 
06:25:44.330 --> 06:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
know what kids are up to yeah for three
 
06:25:46.910 --> 06:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
minutes if you could wrap up please yes
 
06:25:49.190 --> 06:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
um one you know I see a lot of surgeries
 
06:25:51.410 --> 06:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
being post bushed particularly nose jobs
 
06:25:52.910 --> 06:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
right everybody talking about deviated
 
06:25:54.288 --> 06:25:54.298 align:start position:0%
symptoms you can get your insurance to
 
06:25:56.208 --> 06:25:56.218 align:start position:0%
cover it no one is legislating that
 
06:25:57.830 --> 06:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
those jobs can't be allowed in fact they
 
06:25:59.208 --> 06:25:59.218 align:start position:0%
are permitted with parental permission
 
06:26:00.410 --> 06:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
it's something that this would take that
 
06:26:02.208 --> 06:26:02.218 align:start position:0%
away and it has a much higher negative
 
06:26:04.548 --> 06:26:04.558 align:start position:0%
result rate and a much higher regret
 
06:26:06.530 --> 06:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
rate so unless we're going to be
 
06:26:07.970 --> 06:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
consistent let's say this for what this
 
06:26:09.650 --> 06:26:09.660 align:start position:0%
is this is a bill that is discrimination
 
06:26:11.448 --> 06:26:11.458 align:start position:0%
against trans people
 
06:26:13.610 --> 06:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
full stop and I'm sorry if it hurts
 
06:26:14.750 --> 06:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
people's feelings to be told they're
 
06:26:16.128 --> 06:26:16.138 align:start position:0%
being hateful when they aren't hurts
 
06:26:17.030 --> 06:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
people's feelings to be called
 
06:26:19.128 --> 06:26:19.138 align:start position:0%
pedophiles and groomers but here we are
 
06:26:23.030 --> 06:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
have a nice day thank you
 
06:26:26.448 --> 06:26:26.458 align:start position:0%

06:26:33.650 --> 06:26:33.660 align:start position:0%

now

06:26:56.030 --> 06:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:26:59.470 --> 06:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
um went to keen and UNH
 
06:27:01.490 --> 06:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
licensed independent clinical social
 
06:27:05.448 --> 06:27:05.458 align:start position:0%
worker for over the past 10 years
 
06:27:05.458 --> 06:27:06.110 align:start position:0%
worker for over the past 10 years
um

06:27:06.110 --> 06:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:09.830 --> 06:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
and also a trans person I a lot of what
 
06:27:11.510 --> 06:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
I had to say has already been said I
 
06:27:14.690 --> 06:27:14.700 align:start position:0%
wanted to add a couple things one of the
 
06:27:16.548 --> 06:27:16.558 align:start position:0%
things in the bill talks about how
 
06:27:19.788 --> 06:27:19.798 align:start position:0%
teachers can't refer to or wouldn't be
 
06:27:21.350 --> 06:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
able to refer to other students other
 
06:27:24.230 --> 06:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
than their biological or name assigned
 
06:27:26.810 --> 06:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
at Birth I have an uncle whose birth
 
06:27:28.430 --> 06:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
name was Leonard
 
06:27:31.368 --> 06:27:31.378 align:start position:0%
um and went by Alan
 
06:27:32.868 --> 06:27:32.878 align:start position:0%
um because he really hated the name
 
06:27:35.150 --> 06:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
Leonard would
 
06:27:37.310 --> 06:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
and that happens where a lot of kids
 
06:27:38.930 --> 06:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
have either nicknames or different names
 
06:27:41.150 --> 06:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
that they want to use but this bill is
 
06:27:43.730 --> 06:27:43.740 align:start position:0%
really focused on folks who
 
06:27:46.610 --> 06:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
um are trained trans so un unfairly is
 
06:27:48.110 --> 06:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
targeting them in their preferred names
 
06:27:49.730 --> 06:27:49.740 align:start position:0%
versus cisgender people and the
 
06:27:51.470 --> 06:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
nicknames they have
 
06:27:53.448 --> 06:27:53.458 align:start position:0%
a part of my work as a licensed clinical
 
06:27:56.390 --> 06:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
social worker is I work with
 
06:27:59.270 --> 06:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
um in emergency services I meet with all
 
06:28:02.930 --> 06:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
of these uh folks that um we're
 
06:28:05.330 --> 06:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
referring to these kids that attempt or
 
06:28:09.230 --> 06:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
have suicidal ideation on a daily basis
 
06:28:11.990 --> 06:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
I can tell you from my personal work
 
06:28:14.810 --> 06:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
doing this work that the kids that we
 
06:28:17.030 --> 06:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
see who show up with suicidal ideation
 
06:28:20.270 --> 06:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
alone are versus kids that have actually
 
06:28:23.270 --> 06:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide the difference is that
 
06:28:25.128 --> 06:28:25.138 align:start position:0%
they have their support a supportive
 
06:28:27.288 --> 06:28:27.298 align:start position:0%
person in their lives whether it's their
 
06:28:29.090 --> 06:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
teacher or their parents who want to get
 
06:28:31.250 --> 06:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
them the support that they need versus
 
06:28:34.570 --> 06:28:34.580 align:start position:0%
the kids that have gone through and
 
06:28:37.970 --> 06:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide whether either by
 
06:28:40.850 --> 06:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
hanging ingesting pills wishing that
 
06:28:42.230 --> 06:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
they could die is because they don't
 
06:28:45.470 --> 06:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
have a supportive person I've been that
 
06:28:47.390 --> 06:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
I've been an individual who have talked
 
06:28:49.010 --> 06:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
to these kids looked at them in the face
 
06:28:50.570 --> 06:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
and they're telling me they have no hope
 
06:28:52.490 --> 06:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
because they don't have a supportive
 
06:28:56.150 --> 06:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
person they and so I think partially why
 
06:28:57.890 --> 06:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
I'm referencing this is to be able to
 
06:28:57.900 --> 06:28:58.788 align:start position:0%
I'm referencing this is to be able to
that

06:28:58.788 --> 06:28:58.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:29:01.670 --> 06:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
to not be able to have teachers for them
 
06:29:05.208 --> 06:29:05.218 align:start position:0%
to talk to or to share this in schools
 
06:29:07.548 --> 06:29:07.558 align:start position:0%
really would put I would see much more
 
06:29:10.070 --> 06:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
instead of kids showing up at the Ed in
 
06:29:12.770 --> 06:29:12.780 align:start position:0%
the emergency department
 
06:29:14.930 --> 06:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
because they're feeling suicidal and
 
06:29:16.910 --> 06:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
they told the teacher and then they can
 
06:29:19.070 --> 06:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
get help I think that we're going to see
 
06:29:21.948 --> 06:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
more actual attempts and suicide
 
06:29:25.250 --> 06:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
completions which I also help support
 
06:29:28.430 --> 06:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
those families and so from I know it's a
 
06:29:30.230 --> 06:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
lot of for folks it's all these stories
 
06:29:32.750 --> 06:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
but I see it every day in the emergency
 
06:29:35.510 --> 06:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
department in the Seacoast
 
06:29:38.090 --> 06:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
um and so just I know you've heard all
 
06:29:39.948 --> 06:29:39.958 align:start position:0%
this but wanted to share those those
 
06:29:39.958 --> 06:29:41.270 align:start position:0%
this but wanted to share those those
things

06:29:41.270 --> 06:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:29:44.030 --> 06:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
um one of those quick three Second Story
 
06:29:46.490 --> 06:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
is that one of the teenagers I saw who
 
06:29:47.868 --> 06:29:47.878 align:start position:0%
did attempt
 
06:29:47.878 --> 06:29:49.330 align:start position:0%
did attempt
suicide

06:29:49.330 --> 06:29:49.340 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
06:29:51.830 --> 06:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
got brought into the hospital it was
 
06:29:53.690 --> 06:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
June so they saw their pride flies in
 
06:29:55.190 --> 06:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
the emergency room and they said that
 
06:29:56.570 --> 06:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
was the first hope that they had ever
 
06:29:58.788 --> 06:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
that they had had in two years because
 
06:30:01.070 --> 06:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
they knew that they weren't Us in the
 
06:30:02.690 --> 06:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
emergency room would be supportive they
 
06:30:05.810 --> 06:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
had no hope for their future and
 
06:30:08.690 --> 06:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
um but talking with us I also have a
 
06:30:12.110 --> 06:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
trans and LGBT pen I wear in my badge
 
06:30:13.730 --> 06:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
and so they opened up to me even though
 
06:30:15.170 --> 06:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
they begged me not to tell their parents
 
06:30:16.570 --> 06:30:16.580 align:start position:0%
because their parents had hit them
 
06:30:19.250 --> 06:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
because of trying to share their
 
06:30:21.650 --> 06:30:21.660 align:start position:0%
identity their trans identity and so
 
06:30:23.868 --> 06:30:23.878 align:start position:0%
just being able to cry with me to say
 
06:30:25.670 --> 06:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
that they really
 
06:30:27.948 --> 06:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
that they want to be able to grow into
 
06:30:30.070 --> 06:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
an adult but they're not sure they can
 
06:30:32.570 --> 06:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
is a really beautiful experience that I
 
06:30:33.650 --> 06:30:33.660 align:start position:0%
get to
 
06:30:35.930 --> 06:30:35.940 align:start position:0%
offer the support and I really hope that
 
06:30:38.270 --> 06:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
you all take these all of this into
 
06:30:41.150 --> 06:30:41.160 align:start position:0%

06:31:11.510 --> 06:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
like oh all these kids are Autistic or
 
06:31:14.270 --> 06:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
ADHD the implication that we cannot
 
06:31:16.128 --> 06:31:16.138 align:start position:0%
consent or understand what we are
 
06:31:17.930 --> 06:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
consenting to
 
06:31:21.048 --> 06:31:21.058 align:start position:0%
um is ableism straight up like I I can't
 
06:31:22.548 --> 06:31:22.558 align:start position:0%
really say anything more than that but
 
06:31:25.250 --> 06:31:25.260 align:start position:0%

06:31:29.208 --> 06:31:29.218 align:start position:0%
people getting these surgeries is
