00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.110 align:start position:0%
0 2 2 8. i haven't had time to look at
the

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
recorded executive session to see how
 
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
this error
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
occurred the question now what do we do
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
is it appropriate or possible to ask
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
ways and means to adopt an amendment to
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
fix this error
 
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
what other options do we have to save
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
this bill thank you
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
that's from representative ross to the
 
00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
clerk with a poppy to me
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
and this morning i get a email from
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
a clerk paul smith with a copy to
 
00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
michael ross
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
good morning technically ways and means
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
isn't meant to deal with policy portions
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
but rather the tax implications
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
if the amendment would have implications
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
i'd suggest that you discuss it with the
 
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
committee as soon as possible
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
so they know what to work with i also
 
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.870 align:start position:0%
so they know what to work with i also
think

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
in order to make the necessary change
 
00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:24.550 align:start position:0%
in order to make the necessary change
you

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
you'll likely want to have file a floor
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
when we have the next in session and
 
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
address it there
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
best paul so
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
i just want you to be aware that
 
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
when you read the bill as amended that
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
amendment wasn't the right amendment
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
so all right the other thing i want to
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
make you aware
 
00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
is that next week i've scheduled
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%

i haven't read them yet with the same
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
relative code so i'm scheduling them
 
00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
both at the same time
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
senate bill 23 changing the requirements
 
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080 align:start position:0%

of the sponsoring charitable
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
organization be present during the
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
during certain games of chance senate
 
00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
bills 25
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
senate bill 48 relative the formula
 
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
used to determine current use tax rates
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
and senate bill 103 nexus provisions for
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
certain disaster related or emergency
 
00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:13.190 align:start position:0%
certain disaster related or emergency
related

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
related
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
work performed in the state so those are
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
the bills that we'll have
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on next tuesday so
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
if you can download those and get
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
familiar with those before that
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
and then the following two days
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
the 17th and 18th
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
finance is really in a pickle
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
they want our revenue estimated
 
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
estimates updated asap
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
and we will do them asap in a logical
 
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.389 align:start position:0%
and we will do them asap in a logical
manner

00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
manner
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
and we're starting today looking at all
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
the things
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
associated with house bill 2.
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
and also also associated with house bill
 
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.310 align:start position:0%
and also also associated with house bill
2

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
2
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
single sales factor house bill
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
281 which they want to fold into house
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
so that's what we'll be concentrating on
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
we would like to be able to
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
agree on house bill 15
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
and get that exec out and that's our
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
last remaining
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
then we have the six bills that we had a
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
public hearing on
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh waiting we'll execute those at a
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
later time
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to do is that everybody received
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
i believe it was yesterday
 
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.110 align:start position:0%
i believe it was yesterday
[Music]

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
from the dra their updated revenue
 
00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:06.870 align:start position:0%
from the dra their updated revenue
estimates

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
go over those and then that'll be the
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
basis of where we start
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
when we do revenue lessons next
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes do you know if those of us
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
that have property on current use will
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
be able to participate
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
in the senate bill debate on current use
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
or is that a conflict
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
that's so noted
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
because i i also have property and
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
current years too
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
so i think when it comes to
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna have to check with you with
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
jordan yes i think all you need to do is
 
00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:05.269 align:start position:0%
jordan yes i think all you need to do is
declare

00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
declare
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
that you have a conflict of interest
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
and then you get to choose whether you
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
acting on it individually if it affects
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
you no more or less than any other
 
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.350 align:start position:0%
you no more or less than any other
person

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
in a certain similar circumstance once
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
you declare that there's a conflict
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
you should be able to uh participate in
 
00:12:26.959 --> 00:12:27.670 align:start position:0%
you should be able to uh participate in
uh

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
discussion of the bill and and even
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
voting on it
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i believe you're right but i'm just
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
verify that with the clerk and the
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
speaker yeah
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
mr chair long ago on
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
they told us that at a time when about
 
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
25 of the people smoked that
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
smokers could vote on
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
on the the smoking bills because
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
on 25 is a lot of the population
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
and i think that there are quite a few
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
people with current use
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
well i'll find out and i i think what
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
jordan said
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
is correct but
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
any other questions before we proceed
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
yeah it's pat um
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
so what's the plan for the six bills
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
that we heard yesterday
 
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of work session would it be the
 
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
following week
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
it would be the following week okay
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
we need to we really need to get these
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
revenues out
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
with uh can and they would like to have
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
them now
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
i know and they have to work with our
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
right my only concern is the uh some of
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
the some of the bills we heard yesterday
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
are gonna need some work
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
i mean i guess we can retain them too
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%

00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um as i
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
talked about with the committee
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
yesterday the purpose of the amendment
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
is to clarify any lingering doubt that
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
remained about travel service
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
agents um being taxed
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
which was not the intent of the bill
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
so i know we have a large uh support
 
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
among the committee members for the bill
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
and this amendment
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
which was written by dra alleviates
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
that last lingering concern among some
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee members including
 
00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.390 align:start position:0%
of the committee members including
myself

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
as well as other stakeholders and
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
interest groups
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm hoping that we can get
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
support for the amendment today and i'm
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions if
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
if any committee members have a question
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
about the amendments though
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments on the
 
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.430 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments on the
amendment

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
further questions or comments on the
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
amendment i see none
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you yes i'd like to
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh i'm speaking in in
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
opposition to the amendment and
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
first it was reference made by
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative baxter to
 
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
dra having drafted the amendment i think
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh it should be clear that the dra
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
is not offering the amendment as a
 
00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:11.510 align:start position:0%
is not offering the amendment as a
proposal

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
they did this for the representative
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
and expressed
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
their views on the amendment which
 
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.909 align:start position:0%
their views on the amendment which
included

00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
the concern that it would create
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
confusion but they thought they could
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
probably address that through
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
rule making that's what they said
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
i hope i'm characterizing it correctly
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
and for me um i think the
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh confusion generated by this amendment
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
is totally unnecessary
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
that the bill is drafted is
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
the original bill as drafted is
 
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
is just right and what is being created
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
by this
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
amendment is the significant potential
 
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.350 align:start position:0%
amendment is the significant potential
for

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
um an interplay between
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
and the room facilitator
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
um i think that's right
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
between the operator and the travel
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
agent excuse me sorry
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
and the what is
 
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
taxable is the full
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
retail price charge for occupancy
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
which is what an operator
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
will be paying but what is not taxable
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.110 align:start position:0%
is the
[Music]

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
travel agent's commission or
 
00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:46.390 align:start position:0%
travel agent's commission or
compensation

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
and if you uh if you move some of the
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
money into the travel agent category it
 
00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:52.950 align:start position:0%
money into the travel agent category it
is

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
um is no longer taxable um
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
and there will be an incentive to do
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary the original bill the
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
text of the original bill makes clear
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
that the full
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
retail price charged for occupancy
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
is what's taxable let's leave it at that
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
and not confuse the issue but trying to
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
put in
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
something that addresses essentially a
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
non-issue as far as i'm concerned
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
james representative malloy
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i concur with uh
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
assessment of this i think it just adds
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
a layer of confusion
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
this bill in its various forms has been
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
in this committee now for a couple of
 
00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.270 align:start position:0%
in this committee now for a couple of
years

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have worked on this very
 
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.310 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have worked on this very
hard

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
hard
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh several of the people that sponsored
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
this bill are in this committee right
 
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
now and uh
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh speaker packard is the prime sponsor
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
and the bill that we presented i think
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
is clean
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
it answers all the questions and um
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
to representative ames point is that
 
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
uh uh i think we're adding a level of uh
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
confusion and i also concur that
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
that even though dra uh helped work on
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
this i don't know that that is meaning
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
that that's a
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh they don't endorse anything but i
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
don't know that that's uh
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh relevant uh to this conversation
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
because the bill itself is a good bill
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
and i will not be supporting the
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative baxter thank you mr chair
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
and i just want to thank representatives
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
malloy and ames for their comments
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
um i do just want to speak to uh what
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
they said
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't just um
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
worked on it was 100 written by dra
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
so it is even though i'm putting forth
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
it was written by dra and i do want to
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
speak to what representative ames said
 
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:56.950 align:start position:0%
speak to what representative ames said
about

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
it was dra's belief that it creates
 
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.390 align:start position:0%
it was dra's belief that it creates
confusion

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's not 100 accurate to my
 
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.070 align:start position:0%
that's not 100 accurate to my
understanding

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
carolyn who wrote the amendment said it
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
has the possibility
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
um to create confusion i think that'd be
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
a better way to paraphrase what she said
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
because she said any amendment could
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
theoretically the new language
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
lead to something but she is comfortable
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
and that's her own words she's
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the amendment
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
as written uh which isn't surprising
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
because she wrote the amendment
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
so while she may not feel it's necessary
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
because she believes the current
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
bill is okay she also is comfortable
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
with the amendment
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
um and while everyone on the committee
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
might not share their concern
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
that there's the issue with travel
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
service agents
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
being taxed um without that that
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
original intent there are committee
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
members and stakeholders that feel that
 
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.149 align:start position:0%
members and stakeholders that feel that
way

00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
so this amendment is a way to prevent
 
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
um and address that concern while doing
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
it in a responsible way
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
um and that's why we have we've done
 
00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
multiple drafts and i worked with the
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
dra so
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
we could have an amendment that they are
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
comfortable with so
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure what the harm is um
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
and that's hopefully that addresses um
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
what the representatives have brought up
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chin on
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
we could have handled this the way it
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
should have been handled which
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
is just by putting something into the
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
blurb which
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
is a legal signal to both the jail car
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
and any court case on about the travel
 
00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:42.149 align:start position:0%
and any court case on about the travel
agents

00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
agents
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
and this does
 
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
put in a measure that would be
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
able to be played with whether they've
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
been in court or not on buy
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
on various businesses
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
and on
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
i want the bill to pass but on
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%

amber oh schanberg i'm sorry

uh mr chairman uh since i'm in
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
opposition to this motion will i get a
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
chance to speak
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
against the motion i've just recognized
 
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.310 align:start position:0%
against the motion i've just recognized
you

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg is presenting a
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
minority position
 
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill i believe on
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
february 10th i oppose this bill
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
because i believe it creates new taxes
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
and new regulations
 
00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
and today i find that i still must
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
contend that house bill 15
 
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
is creating a new tax with more
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
government regulations
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
with the amending of the definitions
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
under meals and rooms rsa 78-a
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
colon 3 roman numerals 6
 
00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
13 and 18. i
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
strongly believe house bill 15 initiates
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
a new tax when placed on goods and
 
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.510 align:start position:0%
a new tax when placed on goods and
services

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
when included in a bundled package for
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
rental of a room
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
if i reserve a room for one night at the
 
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
inn on pleasant lake in new london for
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
249 dollars
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
my rooms and meals tax would be 22.41
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
but if the inn says instead of you
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
making a call to ragged mountain or
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
mount centipede
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
for skiing arrangements the inn says we
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
have an arrangement with the mountains
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
to offer you a winter sports package
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
for another 180 dollars so that you will
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
be guaranteed lift tickets
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
skis helmet and a reserved spot for
 
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.549 align:start position:0%
skis helmet and a reserved spot for
skiing

00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
skiing
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
guess what happens under house bill 15
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
this bundled package approach
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
is now considered to be part of the
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
because it comes with the room and thus
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
increases the amount
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
of the meals and rooms tax to be charged
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
with this new definition
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
a tax increase i say yes if you don't
 
00:30:25.919 --> 00:30:26.389 align:start position:0%
a tax increase i say yes if you don't
ski

00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
ski
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
say you want to take advantage of a
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
flower arrangement package for the room
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
for your special someone and a spa
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
treatment just like the sports package
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
for skiing
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
this will fall under the new rooms and
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
meals tax definition
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
because it comes with the room and an
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
increase in the amount of the meals
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
and room tax to be charged under the
 
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
amended definitions
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
if these items would be purchased
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
separately in the hotel lobby
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
or call the ski mountains on your own
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
there would be no rooms and meals tax
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
that is connected to the room so if
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
house bill 15 is implemented with the
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
amended definitions
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
but presently doesn't have a sales tax
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
on it now will be included as part of
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms tax
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
because it is part of the bundled
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
package included
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
with the room and since this bill mr
 
00:31:16.159 --> 00:31:16.870 align:start position:0%
with the room and since this bill mr
chairman

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
is also dealing with car sharing
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
platforms i feel that once again
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 15 is changing the
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
regulations to tax this peer-to-peer
 
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.269 align:start position:0%
regulations to tax this peer-to-peer
approach

00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
being peer-to-peer is not about tourism
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
and is not like a car rental company
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
we are talking about individual car
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
owners trying to cover expenses by using
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
a public bulletin board this
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer public platform
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
does not own or operate any fleet of
 
00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.350 align:start position:0%
does not own or operate any fleet of
vehicles

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
they do not take possession or control
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
of a customer's car
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
they are public bulletin boards for
 
00:31:51.519 --> 00:31:52.710 align:start position:0%
they are public bulletin boards for
connections

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
connections
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
if house bill 15 is implemented it seems
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
that this bill
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
would require me the car owner the host
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
to register with the dra and post a
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
business license
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
what happened to promoting the
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial spirit are we going to
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
tax citizens who simply
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
want to share their personal property
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
with another person
 
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
potentially within their community mr
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
chair i present a rhetorical question
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
what is the difference between taxing
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer car sharing
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
under the rooms and meals tax and me
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
individually speaking with my neighbor
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
to borrow a pickup truck to do yard work
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
and filling their truck up with gas when
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
i am done
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
that is consideration paid for the use
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
of a vehicle
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
it is this a transaction subject to
 
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.750 align:start position:0%
it is this a transaction subject to
taxation

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
taxation
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
if it isn't done over the internet can a
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
transaction be taxed
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
because it is done over the internet
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
yet other similar transactions won't be
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
subject to taxation
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
i find that house bill 15 as applied to
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer sharing over the public
 
00:32:58.559 --> 00:32:59.590 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer sharing over the public
platform

00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
platform
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
seems to be as i said before on february
 
00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:03.430 align:start position:0%
seems to be as i said before on february
10th

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
10th
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
auntie entrepreneurial i would now
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
include that house bill 15 seems to be
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
anti-innovation and even anti-green
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
i feel that if this committee chooses to
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
amend the law
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
to tax online platforms the meals and
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
rooms tax
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
with this house bill 15 i believe is a
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
new tax with a new regulations
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i stand in opposition to
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 15.
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you testimony representative
 
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.470 align:start position:0%
thank you testimony representative
representative

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on representative
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
schamberg has brought together
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
a number of new accusations
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh i do not know if we have the
 
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.630 align:start position:0%
uh i do not know if we have the
capability

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
capability
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
of uh suspending while we listen to the
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
dra respond to them
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
one of them is that packages
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
would be taxed on because of this bill
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
packages have never been taxed on of
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
skis or flowers or whatever under
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh the rooms and meals tax i do not
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
believe that it is possible that they
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
would be taxed
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
with this bill in place but uh the dra
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
is in the audience on the other one
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
is relative to innovation
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
on when you innovate in a way that
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
you are still providing the service but
 
00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:30.149 align:start position:0%
you are still providing the service but
you

00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
are evading the tax on
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
that has been in place for a long time
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
on that kind of service
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
on our law has to be altered
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
to include equivalent services
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
that have changed due to innovation
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
if we don't do that we are creating a
 
00:34:54.879 --> 00:34:55.750 align:start position:0%
if we don't do that we are creating a
situation

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
where people who are providing the
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
service in a more traditional way
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
on competition against them
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
and that is what you are advocating for
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
as far as i can tell on i would like
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
to ask if there is some way that we can
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
ask the dra
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
to to respond thank you
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to uh honor that
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
carolyn melissa and devon yeah
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
mr chairs is the proper procedure to uh
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
ask for because where the motion has
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
been made hasn't it
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
i think we we may have to have the
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
motion withdrawn
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
otp as amended to be safe you're right
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
um then we can go back into executive
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
session after we hear from
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
with the amendment representative baxter
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
and representative nunes would you
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
want to withdraw your emotion now
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay and mr chair if i may the reason i
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
say that is because
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
we've been working on this for numerous
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
sessions now
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
so i feel like we've got a pretty good
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
understanding of what this bill does
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
i i uh mr chair i i actually agree with
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative varmy that
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
i think the dra can um address
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
all the points that uh representative
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
schomburg brought up
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh and help help your cause actually
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
represent a baxter but
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
um that's all we're trying to do
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
you're going to be allowed to make your
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
motion again it's just a proper
 
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.750 align:start position:0%
motion again it's just a proper
procedure

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
i i i was hoping that
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
they could withdraw the motion so we
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and perhaps it's
 
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.190 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and perhaps it's
helpful

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
if i read from my own written notes of
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
the testimony that
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
carolyn lear provided at our hearing
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh on january 28th thank you that is
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
she specifically stated vacation
 
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.230 align:start position:0%
she specifically stated vacation
packages

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
packages
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
including ski passes and add-ons only
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
the room charges are taxed under the
 
00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:47.829 align:start position:0%
the room charges are taxed under the
maintenance

00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
under the meals and rooms tax
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
so that i don't i don't think that's an
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
open issue
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
especially if it's separately stated
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:09.839 --> 00:38:13.990 align:start position:0%

was duro when they came in last year
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%

that they are providing the insurance
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh cleaning if necessary if there's
 
00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.030 align:start position:0%

this point that they do provide they are
not

not
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
just a bulletin board they are making it
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
possible for
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
a person that will let their car go to a
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
stranger feel comfortable
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%

representative nunes so i would just
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%

11th amendment
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um whoever writes
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
the blurb should probably
 
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
incorporate the uh statement i think uh
 
00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.750 align:start position:0%
incorporate the uh statement i think uh
representative

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
spillsbury just said so that uh the
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
people on the floor have a good idea as
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
to what this bill does
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
and doesn't do may i make that
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
suggestion sir
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um so i believe where we're at
 
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:30.390 align:start position:0%
thank you um so i believe where we're at
just

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
double checking actually because we've
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
had a lot of uh intervening things
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
we're we're now at on the motion
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended is that right
 
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.349 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended is that right
yes

00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
okay um yes i'm going to vote for this
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh what to pass as amended um
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
i do so with reluctance because i think
 
00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
the bill has been diminished
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
made uh vulnerable to uh
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
being sidetracked by litigation and uh
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
i regret that but i think it's a a very
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
good bill
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
that uh it levels the playing field in a
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
way that's
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh been needed for several years that
 
00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:10.790 align:start position:0%
uh been needed for several years that
became

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
became
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
evident through litigation brought uh
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
several years ago by
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
one of the uh i think room facilitator
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
groups that uh
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
that said that dra was overreaching so
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
this is a good bill um it's a good bill
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
with the amendment it could be much
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
better if we
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
if we hadn't added this language to the
 
00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.710 align:start position:0%
if we hadn't added this language to the
amendment

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%

language last year
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%

00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
amendment is needed either
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%

well today is thursday

00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
all right that closes our business

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
change and just go
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
into a discussion of the
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
parts of hospital ii that affects
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
i'll given a um
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
a document that jennifer put together
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
for us where she went to
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
the entire hospital too and pulled out
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
those sections which she felt had some
 
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.390 align:start position:0%
those sections which she felt had some
relations

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
relations
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
with revenues that were in house built
 
00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:14.390 align:start position:0%
with revenues that were in house built
too

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
is before establishing the graphic
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
service fund in the department of
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
section four page two
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
appears to establish a new dedicated
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
fund that is not
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to pull up house built two
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
separately on another
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
computer because i don't have a copy of
 
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.549 align:start position:0%
computer because i don't have a copy of
it

00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
they've mailed me a copy but i don't i
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman on i found i think it's
 
00:48:12.079 --> 00:48:12.710 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman on i found i think it's
about

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
10 other cases in which
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
they'd set up dedicated funds that
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
that on are not treated as dedicated
 
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.150 align:start position:0%
that on are not treated as dedicated
funds

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay it may not be that many i've got to
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
go back and count
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
but there are there are a fair number of
 
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.270 align:start position:0%
but there are there are a fair number of
them

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
this one i believe a number of these
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
this that's that's on in
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
612 all the dedicated funds uh
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
rsa 612 all the dedicated funds are
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh established and the only uh
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
difference is on in some cases within
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds they use
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
accounting units only
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
rather than listing things
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
which could include this i guess
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
arguably as
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
a on accounting unit but not as
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
a dedicated subfund within
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
on das but i don't believe das has a
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund that it would be a sub
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
fund of it's a revolving account
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
on and it off so that
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
that monies that come in for for
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
on graphics services get separated off
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
from everything else in das
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
and can't get transferred to them easily
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything associated with
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
these graphic
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
services dedicated funds that wouldn't
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
pack the revenues that we
 
00:50:09.599 --> 00:50:15.910 align:start position:0%
pack the revenues that we
need

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
so we're not going to deal at all with
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
the dedicated funds issues because when
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
they put
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
on that is one of our charges as the
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
ways and means committee
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
and they put uh when they put something
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
in without that we have to go back and
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
mop it up the next
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
year so we will discuss this
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
when we go into dedicated funds i don't
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
see anything here that's kind of
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about revenues
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
sequesterings the next item is
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
number 24 suspend revenue sharing norm
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
christie has his hand up he may be able
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
to shed some light
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
okay chris go ahead
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
so just just to give the committee a
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
little background on the graphic
 
00:51:07.359 --> 00:51:08.549 align:start position:0%
little background on the graphic
services

00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
in the budget that's treated as a
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
restricted fund so the revenue they
 
00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:12.309 align:start position:0%
restricted fund so the revenue they
collect

00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
collect
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
goes directly to graphic services and at
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
the end of the fiscal year
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
if there's any money left it
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
transfers to the general fund if there's
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
a negative the general fund helps pay
 
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:24.309 align:start position:0%
a negative the general fund helps pay
for

00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
any shortfall so typically um
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
surpluses have ranged anywhere from
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
thirteen thousand to sixty thousand
 
00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.069 align:start position:0%
thirteen thousand to sixty thousand
dollars

00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year twenty there was a 140
 
00:51:36.319 --> 00:51:37.270 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year twenty there was a 140
000

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
shortfall in revenue due to the pandemic
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
so the department um is requesting to
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
set up a dedicated fund
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
um that clearly defines um you know that
 
00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:47.990 align:start position:0%
um that clearly defines um you know that
this

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:49.839 align:start position:0%
graphic services can keep the money in
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
the fund so when they do have a
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
year where they're short revenue they
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
can go into the fund and bring the money
 
00:51:55.359 --> 00:51:56.150 align:start position:0%
can go into the fund and bring the money
forward

00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
there's also some concerns about some
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
long-term employees within
 
00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:02.839 align:start position:0%
that division or group that will be
 
00:52:02.839 --> 00:52:04.069 align:start position:0%
that division or group that will be
retiring

00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
retiring
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
and they wanted to um in the next few
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
years and they were hoping to kind of
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
build up a reserve to
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
um help with the payout that would be
 
00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
associated with a person leaving state
 
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:13.829 align:start position:0%
associated with a person leaving state
service

00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
instead of having to go to a salary and
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
benefit adjustment account which has
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
been um
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
diminishing over the years based on the
 
00:52:20.559 --> 00:52:21.750 align:start position:0%
diminishing over the years based on the
better

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
budgeting that occurs with positions
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
so i just want to give the committee
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
that you know that that is what's going
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
on with graphic services
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
and it does establish a dedicated fund
 
00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.670 align:start position:0%
and it does establish a dedicated fund
um

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
in section 7 of house bill 2 was
 
00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.270 align:start position:0%
in section 7 of house bill 2 was
introduced

00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
section 7 and yeah it creates the
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
graphics services fund and it inserts it
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
into 612
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
following um subparagraph 364.
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
so this section number that's associated
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
it should have been section seven rather
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
than section well
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
well that's the that's where the funds
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
created i think the sections you have
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
um earlier kind of describe the what's
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
that just to hopefully help you know
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
are there a lot of 612's in section
 
00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.109 align:start position:0%
are there a lot of 612's in section
seven

00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
seven
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
i didn't see section seven is that just
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
graphic services yes it's specific to
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
graphic services
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
i would need to look at some of the
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
others represent all me to see um
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
why they didn't it didn't include the
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
612 why they didn't there may be a
 
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:51.750 align:start position:0%
612 why they didn't there may be a
reason

00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
right section 7's
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
none of us have a copy of hb2 i think
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
um the next section the number
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
is just revenue sharing with cities in
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
town for the biennium
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
norm there's more questions
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i've only been
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
in the house for 20 years but i'm a
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
little lost here
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
what is the objective what are we doing
 
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:38.710 align:start position:0%
what is the objective what are we doing
here

00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
talking about house bill 2 which is a
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
finance bill
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
i understand the requirements we have
 
00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:45.430 align:start position:0%
i understand the requirements we have
but

00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
what what are we supposed to get out of
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
this discussion today
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
the finances asked us to look at house
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
bill 2
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
and pick out all those things associated
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
with revenue
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
and give their estimate and give an
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
estimate to them
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to be positive or
 
00:55:03.599 --> 00:55:07.910 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to be positive or
negative

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
so we've been asked by finance to do
 
00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.589 align:start position:0%
so we've been asked by finance to do
this

00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
they gave us about a half a dozen places
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
i asked jennifer to go through the whole
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
too and there are other issues that
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
could possibly affect
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
revenues and that's what we're doing
 
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.589 align:start position:0%
revenues and that's what we're doing
today

00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
representative bromley yeah then so
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
as far as this one is concerned it
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
creates a new fund
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't create revenue or destroy
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
revenue it just moves revenue around to
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
a different fund is that correct
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
uh maybe chris shea could respond to
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
that right it doesn't create revenue
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
and is it is it is it that different
 
00:55:53.119 --> 00:55:54.950 align:start position:0%
and is it is it is it that different
departments

00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
departments
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
to pay in for use of this graphic
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
service bureau exactly the internal
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
so all the um a lot of materials that um
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
you get if you're on a fiscal committee
 
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
are coming from graphic services we're
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
using them to do mass
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
production and we pay them for that
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
service as do
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
other agencies that use graphic services
 
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:19.589 align:start position:0%
other agencies that use graphic services
um

00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
it comes out of your budget your impact
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
on your general fund could be anywhere
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
from ten to
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
sixty thousand dollars a year because
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
you would now have that restricted
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
um de minimis in the amount i mean it
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
would be in the other fun
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
category to begin with um you wouldn't
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
see it you wouldn't know it
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
um and and the reason for again
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
establishing the dedicated account
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
or fund um was to build up a little bit
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
of a reserve in in the funds so that
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
they could address
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
um some anticip anticipated retirements
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
coming up but as well as when there's um
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
times when agencies as we are
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
experiencing with the pandemic aren't
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
using graphic services
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
as much because people aren't producing
 
00:57:00.559 --> 00:57:01.430 align:start position:0%
as much because people aren't producing
paper

00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
paper
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
um the same way they might have in the
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
past because of everything being sent
 
00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.270 align:start position:0%
past because of everything being sent
electronically

00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
graphic services doesn't have enough
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
revenue to in 20 at least in 2020 didn't
 
00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
have enough revenue
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
to cover it expense expenditures so the
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
general fund has had to cover that for
 
00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.990 align:start position:0%
general fund has had to cover that for
them

00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
so again i think this was just an effort
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
on their part to put some money in a
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund and use it for graphic
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
services over the long period not the
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
short term
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay represented yearly followed by
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
representative elliott
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i was just concerned
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
about setting up yet another
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund that we're going to have
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
to monitor well the idea of setting
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
money aside
 
00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:46.799 align:start position:0%
in a fund uh seems to make sense and it
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
seems to me uh
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
fiscally sound um is this going to wind
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
up with one of those other funds that
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
you and representative almi are going to
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
have to uh
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
look at and look at to see whether or
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
not it's being used or
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
is going to wind up you know someplace
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
in the garbage heap where
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
no one does anything with it because the
 
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.510 align:start position:0%
no one does anything with it because the
money

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
for what's being done is now just
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
languishing in an account somewhere
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
let me clear something up here
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
our purpose right now is to identify
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
those parts of house bill
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
2 that will affect revenues
 
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
that will go to the general fund or the
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
highway fund or efficient game fund
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
we came upon this this is the first item
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
has to do
 
00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
with a dedicated fund being sent out
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
we looked at it and it doesn't affect it
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like it's going to affect
 
00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:42.549 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like it's going to affect
the

00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
revenues going to the fund so
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
we will save any further discussion on
 
00:58:48.559 --> 00:58:49.430 align:start position:0%
we will save any further discussion on
that

00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
so then we can move on to section 42
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
which is the next one that's been
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks pat for keeping me honest
 
00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:19.589 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks pat for keeping me honest
here

00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
you're muted yes i spent a lot of time
 
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:23.510 align:start position:0%
you're muted yes i spent a lot of time
yesterday

00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
um trying to get a copy of house bill
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
2 and when my computer was done i
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
realized that i got
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
the wrong year in there i had 2019
 
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
and that was 160 pages long
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
so then i tried 2021
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
and i was told that there is no report
 
00:59:46.559 --> 00:59:47.349 align:start position:0%
and i was told that there is no report
yet

00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
so i'm assuming that i should have used
 
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
the year
 
00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
2020. is that correct
 
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
no i'm looking at the house built too
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
that just came out on the
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
site when you say it just came out
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
you talking about today or yesterday
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's been out a few days
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
it's a 2021 session
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
well maybe there's something wrong with
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
my computer because it says
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh yesterday it said that it hasn't been
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
written yet
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
so i'll try again with 2021
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
send getting a copy
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
which i assume will be another 160 pages
 
01:00:47.359 --> 01:00:53.430 align:start position:0%
which i assume will be another 160 pages
long

01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative obama was shaking his
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
head no
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
what did do you mind if i asked him why
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
well yeah because jennifer four
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
summarized for us
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
the sections of house bill 2 that were
 
01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
relevant and that's that's what i'm
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
working off of here
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
i just resent it to representative
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%

01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
and so she sent you a summary
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
well thank you we're not touching all of
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%

that's a blessing
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
okay on to the second piece
 
01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
of the many pieces uh
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
has to do with suspending revenue
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
sharing with cities and towns for the
 
01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.789 align:start position:0%
sharing with cities and towns for the
biennium

01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh that's strictly up to the finance
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
committee to make that
 
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
all we can do is come up and we will be
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
what is the total amount of revenue
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
the rooms and meals tax is going to be
 
01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.470 align:start position:0%
the rooms and meals tax is going to be
raising

01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
raising
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
in fy 22 and 23
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
and 21 and
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
there's a certain percentage by law that
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
should go back
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
to the towns as as long as the
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
legislator doesn't suspend it in which
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
they've been
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
doing it and just sending a portion of
 
01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.230 align:start position:0%
doing it and just sending a portion of
the

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:44.150 align:start position:0%
the
future

01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
i just add that this
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
provision is exactly the same as the
 
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
provision two years ago in the previous
 
01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:51.829 align:start position:0%
provision two years ago in the previous
budget

01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly and
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
this one here the finance committee's
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
gonna have to make up the decision what
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
they want to do once
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
we finalize what the revenues are going
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
in the ways and means we gave them our
 
01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.069 align:start position:0%
in the ways and means we gave them our
estimates

01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
when we work on it next week we may
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
change that depending upon what we find
 
01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:19.589 align:start position:0%
change that depending upon what we find
out

01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
the next one is
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
enabling the liquor commission to
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
process merchant cards
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%

sue i'm sorry we'll hear from chris
first

01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
uh thank you represent major so section
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
43 the liquor commission processing of
 
01:03:54.069 --> 01:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
merchant cards
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
that's been in house bill 2 for at least
 
01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.430 align:start position:0%
that's been in house bill 2 for at least
three

01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
times now and what that language does it
 
01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.630 align:start position:0%
times now and what that language does it
allows

01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
allows
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission not to have to go
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
through doit
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
when they have an issue with their
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
computer system that's attached to their
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
point of service or point of sales
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
and so they've asked for that each year
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
each of the budget years i think for the
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
last three
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
cycles um because there was some
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
concerns that doit couldn't be as
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
responsive as they might need if their
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
systems went down say on the weekend
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
on retainers not the right word but
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
they have somebody that they've agree
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
are working with to
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that they can keep their
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
credit card system up and running and if
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
there's any
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
um issues they can be nimble and quick
 
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
to respond and
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
so in terms of a revenue impact there's
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
no direct revenue impact related to that
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
next item in section 77
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
transfer funds from the revenue
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
stabilization reserve account to the
 
01:05:04.559 --> 01:05:05.430 align:start position:0%
stabilization reserve account to the
general

01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
fund surplus and that's strictly a
 
01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:08.549 align:start position:0%
fund surplus and that's strictly a
decision

01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
and so we should be able to move on
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
the next is section 78 reduce the tax
 
01:05:26.349 --> 01:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
2027 and eliminate the interest and
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
dividend tax
 
01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
now the way
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's written in the budget it's going to
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
and fy23
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
is what is the estimate
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
uh from the dra
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
has it changed and what it what did they
 
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.910 align:start position:0%
has it changed and what it what did they
provide

01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
yes yeah
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh they did they said uh the impacts
 
01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:08.950 align:start position:0%
uh they did they said uh the impacts
into

01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
is the dras on the line can we just ask
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
him if they still stand behind the 6.3
 
01:06:30.839 --> 01:06:33.910 align:start position:0%
him if they still stand behind the 6.3
million

01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.829 --> 01:06:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.839 --> 01:06:50.230 align:start position:0%
 
carolyn

01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
hi mr chair carolyn lear assistant
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the new hampshire
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
department of revenue
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
i can confirm that the 6.3
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
million figure is still good for fiscal
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
year 2023
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
but if you have any in-depth questions
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
about that analysis i would ask that you
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
unmute melissa rollins who actually did
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
any anybody want to
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
ask melissa rollins on the
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative thank you on
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
is that just the uh
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
estimate payments for
 
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
march april and and june
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
why don't we bring melissa in
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
i gave her permission to speak melissa
 
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
did you answer that question
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
i did uh for the record melissa rollins
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
senior financial analyst at the
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
department of revenue
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative elmi for your
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
question you're spot on
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
um that is just for those estimate
 
01:08:11.119 --> 01:08:11.670 align:start position:0%
um that is just for those estimate
payments

01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
in april and june um it's about 20
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's just a small percentage that
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
will be applicable about 27
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
will be applicable for fiscal year 23 so
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
just a partial impact because of
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
and if i could then after in the
 
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
following budget years
 
01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
on we will lose 20 percent
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
of the revenue sequentially every year
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question it's a
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
little bit more each year so when you
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
get to fiscal year 24
 
01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
you're now having the remaining
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
estimates in returns
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
plus the next year's estimates so when
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
you get to fiscal year 24
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
the impact goes to 22.2 million
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
and then hovers around the 20 million
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
mark in until you get to the full phase
 
01:09:10.239 --> 01:09:10.630 align:start position:0%
mark in until you get to the full phase
out

01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
did we get i don't think we got a sheet
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
that shows
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
can we get that information when we
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
meet with you next
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that would be i think it
 
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
will be in hb2 um
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
once that's fully submitted and um
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
posted chris can confirm that for us as
 
01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:52.229 align:start position:0%
posted chris can confirm that for us as
well

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
we need to confirm that's what the
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
revenues are going to be
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
those years representative this is
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
carolyn lear
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
again i think what melissa was trying to
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
say is um
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
that that will be in the fiscal note for
 
01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.390 align:start position:0%
that that will be in the fiscal note for
hb2

01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
um and that we have not given that
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
to chris it probably will be given to
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
him today
 
01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
so as long as the fiscal note is to you
 
01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:26.870 align:start position:0%
so as long as the fiscal note is to you
by

01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
wednesday um you should have it but i
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
don't know that we know
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
how long it will take them to turn that
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair can i have a phone
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
on this on
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
well this is based on i believe on uh
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
what we got in
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh when in
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
fy 2419
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
on and of course we won't
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
know what the future is going to bring
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
that could provide for this tax
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
but i just want to say that this is
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
we have never before a few terms ago
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
tried to put multi-year taxes that are
 
01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.510 align:start position:0%
tried to put multi-year taxes that are
only

01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
affecting future budgets not the budget
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
we're in
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
on into the budget bill
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
vetted and and argued because it's part
 
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
of the budget
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
and on i believe that this
 
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
is fiscally irresponsible that we are
 
01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.030 align:start position:0%
is fiscally irresponsible that we are
committing

01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
committing
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
the state on to
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
losing a very large amount of money
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
at some point in the future we have no
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
what the state is going to need at that
 
01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:52.709 align:start position:0%
what the state is going to need at that
point

01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:11:52.719 --> 01:12:00.709 align:start position:0%
point
thank

01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
um i want to first
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
second what uh representative omni just
 
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
said but
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
i want to uh emphasize sort of a
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
a piece of that
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
that this conversation points towards
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
revenue losses in the years after the
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
this two-year budget and i think
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
we need to when we have a proposed piece
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
of legislation like this
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
that reaches beyond the budget period
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
and that's good that we're doing that
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
as a general principle we need to
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's one of our responsibilities to
 
01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.550 align:start position:0%
it's one of our responsibilities to
document

01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
what those impacts are in the years
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
after after the in this case fiscal year
 
01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:55.669 align:start position:0%
after after the in this case fiscal year
23.

01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
23.
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
um and so here in in the case of this
 
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
tax it's very clear there are
 
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
significant impacts
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see those clearly laid out i
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
i believe that's what
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
dra is going to be doing for us we're
 
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at other sections of
 
01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.229 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at other sections of
hp2

01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
hp2
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
that also have similar uh
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
that relate forward and have impact and
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
put it all together and show to what
 
01:13:22.159 --> 01:13:23.030 align:start position:0%
put it all together and show to what
extent

01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
extent
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
we're diminishing or maybe in some cases
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
increasing the flow of revenue into the
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:38.189 --> 01:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
i completely agree with both years and
 
01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
represents comments
 
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
but we have to
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
live with what we have right right now
 
01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:47.189 align:start position:0%
live with what we have right right now
is

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
to me that's not the right way to do it
 
01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.110 align:start position:0%
to me that's not the right way to do it
but

01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
further comment on section 78
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
which has to do with a reduction in the
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
then we'll move on to mr mr chairman
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes if i could i also think that this
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
particular way of doing it reducing by
 
01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:19.510 align:start position:0%
particular way of doing it reducing by
percentage

01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
on puts the advantage
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
to the richest people up front
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
the way that it was being done in the
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
bill that was put in
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
it increased the deductions every
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh each year
 
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
which took away part of the tax each
 
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
year it took away
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
less of it in the beginning but it also
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
helped enormously the people who have
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
the most trouble
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
paying it from the beginning and this
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
one does not
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you what would your recommendation
 
01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:00.790 align:start position:0%
thank you what would your recommendation
be

01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
well to eliminate it all together but
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
but faulting that to to use the
 
01:15:08.239 --> 01:15:09.030 align:start position:0%
but faulting that to to use the
deduction

01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
deduction
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
method which
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
at least helps the people who who
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
have the most trouble paying and would
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
you say
 
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
there's a reduction method that
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
generates the same amount of
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
reduction i believe that it would not
 
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
generate as much reduction from the
 
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:32.630 align:start position:0%
generate as much reduction from the
beginning

01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
because the people that would be
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we we need the drh to take
 
01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
a look at it
 
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
why don't we do that and uh
 
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps and news thank you mr
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and uh in this discussion
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
are we talking about the bill that came
 
01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:56.790 align:start position:0%
are we talking about the bill that came
through

01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
that that uh raised the exemption
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
is that what we're saying that that
 
01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
we're that we would like to be more
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
familiar with that bill instead of
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
what's going on here
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
yes we retained that bill to do that
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
but just some of the language that was
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
on there was that we were saying
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
deduction and i just wanted to clarify
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about the bill with
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
the exemptions with the with the raised
 
01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.070 align:start position:0%
the exemptions with the with the raised
exemption

01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
yes thank you it's just clarification
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
anything else on the interest and
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
dividend tax
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
norm yeah representative bromley yeah i
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
mean it's the two bills the one was
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
lying's bill
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
and uh he he also had the uh
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
the uh the tax credit reversal
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh but that's that was the minimum bill
 
01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:47.970 align:start position:0%
the other the other bill
 
01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:49.189 align:start position:0%
the other the other bill
[Music]

01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
was the was the big bill that actually
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
got got rid of it in five years got rid
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
of this tax in five years
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh i think that's the bill that also but
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
they also increased the
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
exemptions as it went along hp58
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so look i i think i think for now
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
we do we're trying to estimate what the
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
impact of the governor's position is for
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
finance of the of the two of the
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
next two years uh which we're doing
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
but if we if as a committee
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
we think that another approach
 
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
you know we can insert what uh
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
one of the other bills and try to
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
convince finance to uh
 
01:17:40.229 --> 01:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
but that's just that's the only option
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
really that or just vote against the
 
01:17:43.679 --> 01:17:44.950 align:start position:0%
really that or just vote against the
budget

01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
so put your thinking cap on review those
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
two bills
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
and relative to what the governor is
 
01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.590 align:start position:0%
and relative to what the governor is
proposing

01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
proposing
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
and see if you can come up with what you
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
think it might be a better way
 
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
with the understanding that many members
 
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
that don't want to do don't want this
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
reduction at all
 
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
even some republicans by the way so
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
um not to this extent but that's
 
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
another discussion it's not going to be
 
01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.390 align:start position:0%
another discussion it's not going to be
easy

01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
easy
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
right rather than an army yes i think
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
that we need the dras comparison of
 
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
how much how much loss each time
 
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
in order to discuss that yes
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
this is our first blush and
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
put these questions out on the table
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
all right we go to the next
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
session section which is section 90
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
oh hold yeah
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
section 92 through 94
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
reduced the tax rate on the meals and
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
rooms tax
 
01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
and this is reducing it from
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
nine percent to eight and a half percent
 
01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
the mills and rooms tax and
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
chris what is that
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
what does the governor have for reducing
 
01:19:23.199 --> 01:19:23.669 align:start position:0%
what does the governor have for reducing
it

01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
chris shelly are you still there yeah
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
it's 19 million dollars um
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
and that came from the dra my
 
01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.709 align:start position:0%
and that came from the dra my
understanding

01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
we all have these numbers by the way
 
01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
this when we were doing the comparison
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
of the governor's
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
revenues these are the adjustments made
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
for his
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
chair major yes um
 
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
i don't have that she that uh
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
representative abrami just spoke to
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
right in front of me
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere in these this mess here uh but
 
01:20:14.239 --> 01:20:15.669 align:start position:0%
somewhere in these this mess here uh but
um

01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
what i remember is that the uh
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
there was an increase in this revised
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
document from the governor of the
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
expected amount to be collected from the
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
rooms of meals tax
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
um total for this year
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
and but then the
 
01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.990 align:start position:0%
and but then the
[Music]

01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
that increase it seemed to me should
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
have left
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
in the next two years because now we're
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
working off of a higher
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
amount and with the drop in the
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
percentage and the tax
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
it essentially means you lose more uh
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
it's only two or three or four million
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
dollars but it's something
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
chris did you get that i think this
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
really important
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
you're right but i heard what
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
represented ames said and and i would
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
defer to dra but
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
i think part of the issue is that um
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
there's been no adjustments because the
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
governor introduced a
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
revenue as part of his budget proposal
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
since then he's come out with a letter
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
um where he's adjusted some of his
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
assumptions related to the to the
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
revenue but we don't have uh
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
we don't have any other adjustments at
 
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
but again i would defer to dra to to see
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
how they
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
are handling that if at all at this
 
01:21:45.679 --> 01:21:47.189 align:start position:0%
are handling that if at all at this
point

01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
in the governor's letter a lot of that
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
has to do with the results in february
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
the results in february total
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
is close to it's up about
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
18 or 19 but
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things we want to remember
 
01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
was that 10 million of that is one-time
 
01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.350 align:start position:0%
was that 10 million of that is one-time
money

01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
due to the lottery the powerball and
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
the other one coming in which doesn't
 
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
happen every year
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
so that's a one-time event and the other
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
one is
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
audit of
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
extra 10 million dollars in february
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
that normally
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
never comes in february that's according
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
um the ira that that's normally
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
so when you add those two together 20
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
and so to you subtract that from the
 
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.350 align:start position:0%
and so to you subtract that from the
february

01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
february
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
results you're going to be under
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
the plan rather than over the plan by
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
18.7 million
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
the governor in his letter indicates
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
that because of february's results
 
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
being so high compared to the plan
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of shifting going on so
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
so the what we made from the vras
 
01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
is that is the 19 million dollar
 
01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.270 align:start position:0%
is that is the 19 million dollar
reduction

01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
in 22 and 23 is what we know
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
now about maybe the reopening
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
and the economy uh
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
so anything more on the males and realms
 
01:23:50.239 --> 01:23:53.990 align:start position:0%
so anything more on the males and realms
tax

01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you on the only result
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
of this tax reduction would be that
 
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:10.719 align:start position:0%
we're losing 19 million dollars a year
 
01:24:10.719 --> 01:24:11.270 align:start position:0%
we're losing 19 million dollars a year
plus

01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
plus
 
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
maybe something um
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
because people do not
 
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
pay attention to the tax on their bills
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
and if they did
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
they would realize that they're going to
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
get an extra five cents
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh back
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
on on a ten dollar i think it's on a ten
 
01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:33.430 align:start position:0%
on on a ten dollar i think it's on a ten
dollar

01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh purchase and um
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
they just aren't going to react to that
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
on it just seems like an unnecessary
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
thing to do it would be better to put
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
that kind of money into something that's
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
help the owners of the restaurants
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
which i think the senate has been
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
working on
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
when you're putting a budget together
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
and you need an extra 20 million dollars
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
this is one way of getting it many ways
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that slight
 
01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.149 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that slight
rejection

01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
rejection
 
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
is for large group sales or
 
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
weddings or big conventions or things
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
and you know i just wonder whether we
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
asking someone uh in the restaurant
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
lodging business
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
where where activity is apt to happen
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
this is a really significant amount of
 
01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:49.830 align:start position:0%
this is a really significant amount of
money

01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
um and i'm just bewildered
 
01:25:57.910 --> 01:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
as to whether the that's really how this
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
it'll be very hard to get it back
 
01:26:08.669 --> 01:26:08.679 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know this i have to agree with
 
01:26:17.110 --> 01:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative all me
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
about you know the impact this has on
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
the consumer and whether or not it makes
 
01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:23.350 align:start position:0%
the consumer and whether or not it makes
them

01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
choose our businesses versus an
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
alternative simply because of this tax
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
reduction i
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
i highly skeptical that it makes any
 
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
difference other than it will reduce our
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
revenues you know and every
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
this is a high performing tax revenue
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
source for the state
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
and every dollar we raise from out of
 
01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
state tourists
 
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
with this tax revenue stream is a dollar
 
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
that we don't have to raise through
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
property taxes or some other means
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
i just think that the net effect of
 
01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:54.629 align:start position:0%
i just think that the net effect of
reducing

01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
reducing
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
this tax rate is going to be a
 
01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:01.400 align:start position:0%
reduction in state revenue
 
01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.030 align:start position:0%
reduction in state revenue
[Music]

01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
really no difference in the kind of
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
consumer activity
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
in this area and perhaps a downshifting
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
of costs because the state will be
 
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
less able to assist municipalities
 
01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
because of the reduction in funds i
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
think this is
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
it sells well politically saying we're
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
going to reduce this rate i think it's
 
01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:26.910 align:start position:0%
bad for the state
 
01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:28.149 align:start position:0%
bad for the state
[Music]

01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%

01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:42.149 --> 01:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
you mr chair i just wanted to add that
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
the amount of work that both businesses
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
and dra
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
have to do to change the rate
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
a half a percent
 
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
is not worth the effort
 
01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
i mean it's just a yeah just wanted to
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
put that piece in there
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
you have to change your computer system
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
to accommodate the change in the rate
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
and yeah so it's a little change
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
generates 20 million bucks a year no
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
and that's my feeling is that's the way
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
they see it
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's the money is
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
whatever representative
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
you have your hands up again
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i just wanted to point out
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
section 65 on page 26
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
the governor has suspended the funding
 
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
of travel and tourism development
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
for the biennium now
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
that was installed when we put
 
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
the rooms and meals tax up to nine
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
percent during the great recession
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
to help us get through the great
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
recession and
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
it was a trade-off for for
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
the tourism and on travel
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
on lounging and restaurant association
 
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
that they appreciated what it does
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
is it provides advertising large-scale
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
advertising to whatever markets they
 
01:29:18.159 --> 01:29:18.629 align:start position:0%
advertising to whatever markets they
think

01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
are going to be most important for new
 
01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:22.709 align:start position:0%
are going to be most important for new
hampshire

01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
on to to provide the image of new
 
01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:27.990 align:start position:0%
on to to provide the image of new
hampshire

01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
and provide the idea that you want to go
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire for your vacations
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
and ever since we put that in
 
01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
with a little dip when they took it out
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
for one term
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
on they uh we have had five
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
percent per year growth in
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
travel and tourism in uh rooms and meals
 
01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:50.830 align:start position:0%
travel and tourism in uh rooms and meals
taxes

01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
particularly in specific and so
 
01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
it has more than paid for itself and it
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
has helped
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
all of the smaller businesses the big
 
01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:01.430 align:start position:0%
all of the smaller businesses the big
chains

01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
chains
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
and the really big places like mount
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
washington hotel can do their own
 
01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:06.310 align:start position:0%
washington hotel can do their own
advertising

01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
advertising
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
the rest of them can't and this is what
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
has been helping increase the
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
the tourism inside of new hampshire and
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's being suspended for two years
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
no matter if we like the policy that's
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
in house built too our job today
 
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
is to evaluate the changes
 
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
that would affect and this change does
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
affect revenues
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to we're coming back from the
 
01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:40.390 align:start position:0%
it's going to we're coming back from the
great

01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
from the the a major recession
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
and from people being stuck in their
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
houses forever and wanting to travel
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
if new hampshire is not in advertising
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
in front of them
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to choose to go other
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
places and every other state knows that
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
so section 55 we're talking about
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%

01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%

26 but i can't look at it at the same
 
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
time that we're meeting
 
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:25.120 align:start position:0%

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:30.390 align:start position:0%
okay so it's section 60 something right
65.

01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
or if you search for travel and tourism
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%

01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
my section 65 has to do with office of
 
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
professional licenses
 
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
good grief how did that oops oh dear
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
major this is chris it's section 55 of
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
house build
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at a pdf it's page 31
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
of the pdf but it's listed as page 26 of
 
01:33:10.719 --> 01:33:12.310 align:start position:0%
of the pdf but it's listed as page 26 of
hb2

01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
correct thank you representative
 
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah here it is i got the page right but
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
i managed to uh i'm getting cataracts
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
so it's just three lines on page
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
31 of the pdf and page 26 of the other
 
01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:43.110 align:start position:0%
31 of the pdf and page 26 of the other
one

01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:47.590 align:start position:0%
one
okay

01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
but that costs considerably less than
 
01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
the 20 million if i remember correctly
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's around six or eight million
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
that they've that has been going into
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
that advertising
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
and the idea that they're taking it out
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
just at the time
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
when people are going to be making
 
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
decisions to
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
so taking that out how much is it going
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
to affect the revenue
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
you will want to look at what the effect
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
plymouth state university keeps on doing
 
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
studies that show it's eight dollars for
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
every one dollar we spend
 
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
on and the of the eight dollars
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
on we get
 
01:34:41.199 --> 01:34:45.270 align:start position:0%
on we get
back

01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
continue looking at that
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
yes um i'm gonna have to go back and
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
find the plymouth state stuff i think it
 
01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:58.229 align:start position:0%
find the plymouth state stuff i think it
was

01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
eight dollars in taxes that we were
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
getting back for every one dollar we
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
so you're gonna we're going to look at
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
that section and yeah
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
and bring the committee up to date when
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%

we'll find the people that are doing
that

01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay the next section has to do with
 
01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320 align:start position:0%

01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:42.149 --> 01:35:42.159 align:start position:0%

01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be losing and i'd
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
like to see that number
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh i know it's a static number and all
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
that stuff but
 
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
basically in relation to what reps of
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
already to what was just being discussed
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
in the travel and tourism that
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
so just so the committee knows the
 
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
finance committee is working
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
on this section right now we're trying
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
to figure out
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
why it was suspended in house bill 2.
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
it may have been suspended because based
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
on the calculation
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
maybe they would have gotten less money
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
than they typically got
 
01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
in past years but we're trying to we're
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
we're looking to find out how that was
 
01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:25.990 align:start position:0%
we're looking to find out how that was
calculated

01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
calculated
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
um what the number would have been
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
compared to what put in the budget
 
01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
um we're having some challenges getting
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
that information
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
um but once i get something i can share
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
it back with you
 
01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
um as to what what the number would be
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
as well as what was put in the budget
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
and maybe why they did this suspension
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
in prior budgets they suspend it because
 
01:36:47.199 --> 01:36:47.910 align:start position:0%
in prior budgets they suspend it because
the

01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh the committee has made decisions that
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
they want to just appropriation on the
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
um on the department related to travel
 
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
and tourism and not abide by this but i
 
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's the case
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
in this instance so i'll have to get
 
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
back to your reps and vulnerabilities
 
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
already just a long way of saying that
 
01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:06.310 align:start position:0%
already just a long way of saying that
yeah

01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
yeah well thank you and just because the
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
the argument or the discussion that
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
susan put forward is compelling
 
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's been compelling for about over a
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
decade now
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative lockman seems to
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
have his hand up
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
i do uh thank you mr chairman i
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
i was briefly disconnected so i'm not
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
sure if it was touched on but i i did
 
01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:36.470 align:start position:0%
sure if it was touched on but i i did
hear

01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
hear
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
before i lost my connection wondering
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
what the effect was and i wonder if
 
01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
tourism leadership there could comment
 
01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
on the return on investment of money
 
01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:50.390 align:start position:0%
on the return on investment of money
spent

01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
spent
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
in advertising because that would seem
 
01:37:52.639 --> 01:37:53.750 align:start position:0%
in advertising because that would seem
to

01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
illuminate how much return we're losing
 
01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
out on by investing nothing
 
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
you know if in past years when we do put
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
money in
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
the expected return on that investment
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
is x then
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
then that increased uh tourism activity
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
is what we're losing out on by investing
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
nothing so i don't know maybe that's the
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
number we could get
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative alami is going to be
 
01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:21.990 align:start position:0%
okay representative alami is going to be
pursuing

01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
pursuing
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i think chris will be pursuing with
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
the department and i can pursue the
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
plymouth state university studies
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
they've done them on every few years
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
we should have more information when we
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
meet next wednesday
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay the next item is section 95 to 97
 
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
to increase the filing threshold for the
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
and the last thing we received from the
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh the ira was
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
it would increase have a decrease of 2.3
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
million in each year
 
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
but that number's changed now norm
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
and maybe uh i think the dra can explain
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
but again i think the dra would be the
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
more appropriate
 
01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
but yeah what i have is
 
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
yeah it doesn't change for 22 but it
 
01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:34.149 align:start position:0%
yeah it doesn't change for 22 but it
goes

01:39:34.149 --> 01:39:34.159 align:start position:0%
goes
 
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
from 2.3 to 3.1 for
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
20 20. but but on the original sheet
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
that we worked on a couple of
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
like a month ago whatever it was it was
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
2.3 and 2.3
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
and dra has now changed it to 0 and 3.1
 
01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh 3.1 loss of revenue
 
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
so they may want to explain uh the
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
reason why they changed from their
 
01:39:59.199 --> 01:40:00.310 align:start position:0%
reason why they changed from their
original

01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:03.830 align:start position:0%
original
caroline

01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative major this is melissa
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
rollins again um
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
so yes happy to explain this so i
 
01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:10.550 align:start position:0%
so yes happy to explain this so i
believe

01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
representative abrami what you're
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
speaking to is
 
01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
um a proposal that was originally
 
01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:17.189 align:start position:0%
um a proposal that was originally
received

01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
received
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
by the governor's office from the dra
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
this had a little bit different
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
parameters than what came through in hb2
 
01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
which is what changes
 
01:40:28.229 --> 01:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
um the amount of the fiscal impact so i
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
think what you have in front of you
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
was a proposal just based on changing
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
the business um the
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
one of the business enterprise
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
thresholds versus changing
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
both of the thresholds and in hb2 it
 
01:40:43.119 --> 01:40:44.149 align:start position:0%
both of the thresholds and in hb2 it
changes

01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
um the gross receipt threshold from 220
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
thousand to two hundred and fifty
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
thousand and then
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
the um the enterprise value threshold
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
from 220 or excuse me from one hundred
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
and eleven thousand to two hundred and
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand so with the business
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax there are two
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
thresholds and hb2 changes both of those
 
01:41:07.119 --> 01:41:08.070 align:start position:0%
thresholds and hb2 changes both of those
thresholds

01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
thresholds
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
which is what the increase is so we have
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
a fiscal impact
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
of 3.1 million for
 
01:41:19.030 --> 01:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year 23
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
um and no impact in in 22
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
and this is because there might be a
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
slight impact in fiscal year 22 because
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
of estimates but it was
 
01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
minor um a minor impact because the
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
reduction is so
 
01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
low that we just put the full impact in
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23.
 
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:46.310 align:start position:0%
 
correct

01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions i'll ask
 
01:41:50.709 --> 01:41:50.719 align:start position:0%
melissa yeah i have a question
 
01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
um representative going forward after
 
01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 is the number any
 
01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:58.149 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 is the number any
different

01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
it is not that that's the full impact
 
01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:04.790 align:start position:0%
it is not that that's the full impact
okay

01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
i have a question also
 
01:42:11.109 --> 01:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
what how many people uh
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
how many businesses will cease to
 
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
file sure great
 
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
great question representative elmi um
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to give two data points
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
here just because i think they're both
 
01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
um they both have some good information
 
01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh so the amount of people that will or
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that will potentially not file
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
and there's a caveat to this so i'll say
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
that afterwards
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
is 34 780
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's based on tax year 18 um
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
return data which is our last completed
 
01:42:46.239 --> 01:42:47.109 align:start position:0%
return data which is our last completed
year

01:42:47.109 --> 01:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
however of those 34 780 taxpayers
 
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
only 5027 of them had
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
a liability so a lot of taxpayers are
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
filing zero returns and not paying
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
because they potentially meet the
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
threshold but don't
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
have a tax liability what i do want to
 
01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:08.790 align:start position:0%
have a tax liability what i do want to
say

01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
in my caveat is gross receipts is a
 
01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
little bit difficult to
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
um to calculate on only because
 
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
not all taxpayers report their gross
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
receipts it's a line that is on the
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax return
 
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
however it is not a line that calculates
 
01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:27.109 align:start position:0%
however it is not a line that calculates
into

01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
um a tax liability so we do have a lot
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
of taxpayers that put
 
01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
zero on there so we just assume they
 
01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need to file
 
01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
however they may need to file so that
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
thirty four thousand seven hundred and
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
eighty no longer filing is a maximum
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
filing amount there may be
 
01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
melissa what was that number 5000 and
 
01:43:52.239 --> 01:43:53.790 align:start position:0%
melissa what was that number 5000 and
what

01:43:53.790 --> 01:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719 align:start position:0%
5027 are the taxpayers that will no
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
longer be
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
filing the business enterprise tax who
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
currently had a liability
 
01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
in tax year 18.
 
01:44:13.590 --> 01:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
all right mr chairman
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
just a foul
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
so oh so so it's only 5 000
 
01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
out of how many approximately are filing
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
would you like the total number number
 
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
of bet filers
 
01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
as a whole well no that pay
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking about the lawsuit we once
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
had in which
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
on on the business enterprise tax was
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
created because
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh the big businesses were saying they
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
were paying the business
 
01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
tax and nobody else was
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
so i always want to make sure that we've
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
got enough people
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
paying the ladder so that the former
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't get attacked again
 
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:30.790 align:start position:0%
 
report

01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
there are around 38 000
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
that are paying so of the 38 000 5000
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
will no longer be required
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
um to file and pay based on the
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
threshold increase
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
section 98 to 99
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
reduce the rate of the tax for the
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
from 0.6
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
to 0.55
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
and then initially
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
that showed that they reduced the
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
revenues fy twenty to
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
four point seven million dollars fy
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
melissa uh yes representative major
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
norman then there's the offsetting uh
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
bpt revenue increase that they
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
also estimated melissa may want to
 
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
the offsetting bpt revenues for 22
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
would be an increase of 2.8 and
 
01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
8.1 and melissa go ahead and explain
 
01:47:40.639 --> 01:47:43.430 align:start position:0%
8.1 and melissa go ahead and explain
that

01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
sure so i think most of you are pretty
 
01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
familiar with our
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
rate reduction analysis knowing that
 
01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's on a static analysis
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
this one is a little bit different
 
01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:55.830 align:start position:0%
this one is a little bit different
because

01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
we're just reducing the bet rate
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
typically the rate reductions go hand in
 
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
hand with bet
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
and bpt together so we don't have to
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
account for what we had to account for
 
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
with this fiscal note which is the bet
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
credit so for the newer members when you
 
01:48:11.119 --> 01:48:11.750 align:start position:0%
credit so for the newer members when you
have

01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
a bpt liability you can offset that
 
01:48:15.669 --> 01:48:15.679 align:start position:0%
liability by
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
the bet paid that's a credit
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
against your bpt and then you pay the
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
net difference
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
so what we needed to look at because the
 
01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:26.310 align:start position:0%
so what we needed to look at because the
bet

01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
bet
 
01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
rate is being reduced the bet liability
 
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
is being reduced meaning the bet credit
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
to offset the bpt
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
is then reduced hopefully i haven't lost
 
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
anybody yet
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
um so looking at we had to look at
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
what would the bpt impact be
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
if there was a credit that was reduced
 
01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:48.709 align:start position:0%
if there was a credit that was reduced
so

01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:51.669 --> 01:48:51.679 align:start position:0%
less money on file to reduce that bpt
 
01:48:51.679 --> 01:48:52.709 align:start position:0%
less money on file to reduce that bpt
liability

01:48:52.709 --> 01:48:52.719 align:start position:0%
liability
 
01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
based on less back credit on file
 
01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
so we looked at taxpayers whose bpt
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who have a bet credit on file
 
01:49:05.590 --> 01:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
against their bpt liability
 
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
and what would they have paid in tax
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
year 18
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
if that bet credit was reduced
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
by the new rate so essentially what
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
their bp their bet liability would
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
look like as a bet credit at the new
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
rate because it would be less
 
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
so looking at that reduced bet credit
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
increases the bpt
 
01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
and that increase flows through to the
 
01:49:28.239 --> 01:49:30.470 align:start position:0%
and that increase flows through to the
2.8

01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
2.8
 
01:49:33.910 --> 01:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
impact in fiscal year 22 and the 8.1
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
additional revenue in fiscal year 23.
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
and would you explain why it's not a one
 
01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
um it's not a one for one because not
 
01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
all taxpayers
 
01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
not all taxpayers bet
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
exceeds their bpt so some taxpayers just
 
01:49:58.480 --> 01:49:59.030 align:start position:0%
exceeds their bpt so some taxpayers just
file

01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
file
 
01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
bet and they don't the bet credit
 
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
um is not going to reduce their bpt so
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
that those taxpayers were taken out of
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
the pool because they have no bpt
 
01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:09.189 align:start position:0%
the pool because they have no bpt
liability

01:50:09.189 --> 01:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
liability
 
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
to be increased because of a less credit
 
01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:12.310 align:start position:0%
to be increased because of a less credit
so

01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
those people came out and also people
 
01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:15.830 align:start position:0%
those people came out and also people
whose

01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
whose
 
01:50:18.870 --> 01:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
bet credit uh exceeds their bpt
 
01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:22.629 align:start position:0%
bet credit uh exceeds their bpt
liability

01:50:22.629 --> 01:50:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
those people are removed as well because
 
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
the bet credit um
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
is already greater than the bpt
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
liability so they're not paying bpt
 
01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:33.750 align:start position:0%
liability so they're not paying bpt
again

01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
61 you're correct
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
on what was what were the numbers for
 
01:50:44.639 --> 01:50:45.109 align:start position:0%
on what was what were the numbers for
the

01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
bet going down
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
a number of us don't have these ages
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
oh sure so to us sure the
 
01:50:58.390 --> 01:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
back credit uh the bet rate reduction
 
01:51:00.390 --> 01:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
would be a four point
 
01:51:03.669 --> 01:51:03.679 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to round 4.7
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
million loss in 22
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
and in 23 it's a 13.3 million dollar
 
01:51:12.719 --> 01:51:13.750 align:start position:0%
and in 23 it's a 13.3 million dollar
loss

01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
loss
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
for the bet credit and then i'll just
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
repeat that's then
 
01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
offset by the bpt increase in fiscal
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
year 22
 
01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
of 2.8 million
 
01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
and in fiscal year 23 the bpd increase
 
01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:28.750 align:start position:0%
and in fiscal year 23 the bpd increase
of

01:51:28.750 --> 01:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
so the net impact if you'd like that
 
01:51:39.990 --> 01:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 22 for the rate
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
reduction so that's the bet
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
decrease minus the bbt increase is 1.8
 
01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:45.669 align:start position:0%
decrease minus the bbt increase is 1.8
million

01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
in 22. 5.2 million
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
in just in anticipation of
 
01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
representative ames's question
 
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
this does flow through to fiscal year 24
 
01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:01.990 align:start position:0%
this does flow through to fiscal year 24
as

01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:10.310 align:start position:0%
as
well

01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
saying none we can move on
 
01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
next is sections 102-105
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
which limits the amount of credit
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
allowed against overpayment
 
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
of the business profits tax and the
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
we hear from the dra how this works
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh melissa would you want to
 
01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
sure um so this one is a is a new fiscal
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
impact i don't believe you guys have
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
seen so just to take a step back i know
 
01:53:15.669 --> 01:53:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh most of the committee is familiar
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
with the credit carryover concept but
 
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll explain that real quick just
 
01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:19.830 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll explain that real quick just
as

01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
as a base knowledge so a credit
 
01:53:22.639 --> 01:53:23.830 align:start position:0%
as a base knowledge so a credit
carryover

01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
carryover
 
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
is when a taxpayer overpays their
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
tax liability and has extra funds on
 
01:53:32.550 --> 01:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
file that they can either receive
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
as a refund or a credit
 
01:53:38.830 --> 01:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
to carry over to the next year's
 
01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:40.310 align:start position:0%
to carry over to the next year's
liability

01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
liability
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
so in this scenario this is looking at
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
that credit that they're carrying over
 
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
to the next year liability
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:54.070 --> 01:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
so looking at the bill this credit is
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
trying to reduce that outstanding credit
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
that's sitting on file
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
um by 50 of the taxpayers prior
 
01:54:02.719 --> 01:54:04.149 align:start position:0%
um by 50 of the taxpayers prior
liability

01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
liability
 
01:54:06.790 --> 01:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
so there is about for tax year looking
 
01:54:07.629 --> 01:54:07.639 align:start position:0%
at tax year
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
2018 um
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
it's about 279.7 million dollars in
 
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
credit care reverse sitting on file
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
keeps growing um it does keep growing
 
01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
sitting on file to be utilized to offset
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
future tax liabilities for taxpayers and
 
01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:35.990 align:start position:0%
future tax liabilities for taxpayers and
taxpayers

01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
do use this in different ways by either
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
reducing some of their estimate payments
 
01:54:43.589 --> 01:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:47.109 --> 01:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
some taxpayers keep it on file as a
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
safety net
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
and there's there's other options as why
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
they have it on there so what hb2
 
01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
is doing is saying it wants to limit
 
01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
that credit carry over on file to 50
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
of the tax the taxpayers tax liability
 
01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't let taxpayers carry more
 
01:55:08.790 --> 01:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
than 50 percent of their liability
 
01:55:12.070 --> 01:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
forward each year would that mean that
 
01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
it automatically get a refund yes
 
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
okay that's correct and
 
01:55:22.709 --> 01:55:22.719 align:start position:0%
what do you anticipate that buildup is
 
01:55:22.719 --> 01:55:24.070 align:start position:0%
what do you anticipate that buildup is
going

01:55:24.070 --> 01:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:55:26.950 --> 01:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh or this law is going to do to that
 
01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:27.830 align:start position:0%
uh or this law is going to do to that
buildup

01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
buildup
 
01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
where it's built up to 279 where this
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
law goes in
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:36.790 --> 01:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think the purpose of this is
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
is to make that
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
credit sitting on file much less than
 
01:55:41.669 --> 01:55:41.679 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
01:55:45.189 --> 01:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
today um that would be like a one-time
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
event really
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
because then let's say they have to
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
refund 50 million dollars
 
01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a hit to total
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
revenues see your right representative
 
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
major it is
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
um it is a a hit to the revenues
 
01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
however it could be spread out based on
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
how taxpayers
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh how taxpayers use this
 
01:56:14.390 --> 01:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
outstanding credit because they could
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
instead of waiting for a refund
 
01:56:18.070 --> 01:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
at the end of the fiscal year they could
 
01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
just not make estimate payments
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
and have the estimate payments eat up
 
01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:23.589 align:start position:0%
and have the estimate payments eat up
that

01:56:23.589 --> 01:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh credit carryover on file do you have
 
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
any idea
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
what the level would be once this law
 
01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
goes into effect
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
we do um we have tried to analyze it
 
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
so i do want to um there's ranges
 
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
because it's hard to determine
 
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
having never uh implemented a lot like
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
this it's hard to determine what exactly
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact will be
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
so i can give you the range for each
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
and tell you what the maximum fiscal
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
so would you like me to give you the
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
ranges that would be
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
good how many ranges do you have
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
um i have a range for each fiscal year
 
01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
from 22
 
01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
to 25 or i can just give you the full
 
01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact you tell me what's easier
 
01:57:29.189 --> 01:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:30.870 --> 01:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
well there's only three sets of ranges
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
why don't you get
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
okay so for fiscal year 22
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
this would be a scenario where they
 
01:57:41.109 --> 01:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
either don't adjust their
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
estimates or they do adjust their
 
01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
estimate so it would be between if they
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
don't adjust their estimates
 
01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
it would be zero to 30.2 million
 
01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:58.470 align:start position:0%
it would be zero to 30.2 million
okay

01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
um then 23
 
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
and 23 it would be
 
01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
wow okay and 24. in 24
 
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
it would be 20.6 to 107 million
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
and this would be the excess
 
01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct that would have to be
 
01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:33.270 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct that would have to be
refunded

01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
wow who thought this was a good idea
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's my reaction why would we want to
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
give the money back
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
i've always been scared of this it looks
 
01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:45.430 align:start position:0%
i've always been scared of this it looks
like

01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:58:48.149 --> 01:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
we're forcing ourselves for this thing
 
01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
we're shooting ourselves in the foot but
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
okay is there one more year
 
01:58:58.990 --> 01:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
there is and then in 25 it's zero to
 
01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:03.679 align:start position:0%
25.4 million
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
okay so now the hump is over yeah so the
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
total fiscal impact depending on how
 
01:59:10.950 --> 01:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers adjust within there would not
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
exceed 137.3 million
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
and and i do want to note we are still
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
working on the fiscal note for this
 
01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
piece so
 
01:59:25.270 --> 01:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
um this is this is our estimate as of
 
01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:28.830 align:start position:0%
um this is this is our estimate as of
today

01:59:28.830 --> 01:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:31.669 align:start position:0%
 
wow

01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
wow
 
01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative major this is assistant
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner carolyn lear i think this
 
01:59:43.599 --> 01:59:44.070 align:start position:0%
commissioner carolyn lear i think this
is

01:59:44.070 --> 01:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
um a natural extension of some of the
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
conversations that the state has been
 
01:59:51.510 --> 01:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
required to have
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
um over the last few years about booking
 
02:00:00.229 --> 02:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
a liability relative to outstanding ccos
 
02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
i i agreed to get this down but wow
 
02:00:05.910 --> 02:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
i was always afraid once it's going to
 
02:00:07.589 --> 02:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
happen this
 
02:00:11.669 --> 02:00:11.679 align:start position:0%
i fall at least
 
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
you're not talking about 200 million
 
02:00:22.229 --> 02:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
all right mr chairman yes
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
but i i still don't understand exactly
 
02:00:30.629 --> 02:00:30.639 align:start position:0%
what we're doing
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
on are we talking about the entire
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
credit that they already have backed up
 
02:00:40.149 --> 02:00:40.159 align:start position:0%
or are we talking about the credit which
 
02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
i thought we were talking about
 
02:00:44.550 --> 02:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
the credit that they uh acquire in a
 
02:00:49.750 --> 02:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
representative only this is carolyn
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
again this would
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
impact credits that are on file today
 
02:01:00.149 --> 02:01:00.159 align:start position:0%
and it would also prevent the additional
 
02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
accumulation of
 
02:01:03.910 --> 02:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
credits going forward so it would be
 
02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:06.229 align:start position:0%
credits going forward so it would be
both

02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
both
 
02:01:10.149 --> 02:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
so so if you had on um
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
five million dollars on file there
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh you would have to to
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
get 2.5 of it back in a refund in the
 
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
single year
 
02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
depending on your
 
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
last year's liability yes um so if their
 
02:01:38.229 --> 02:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
last year's liability was five million
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
and they have a five million dollar
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
credit on file
 
02:01:44.070 --> 02:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
then yes they would have to receive a
 
02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:45.109 align:start position:0%
then yes they would have to receive a
2.5

02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
2.5
 
02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:47.679 align:start position:0%
million dollar refund um the department
 
02:01:49.589 --> 02:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
would not allow them to continue to
 
02:01:49.599 --> 02:01:49.990 align:start position:0%
would not allow them to continue to
carry

02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
carry
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
that full 5 million dollar credit on
 
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
could we spread this out over 10 years
 
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
or something
 
02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
that's a good question representative i
 
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
think that there are
 
02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely options that we could um
 
02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
discuss with the committee um to
 
02:02:15.270 --> 02:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
ease into the fiscal impact if that's
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
something that you would
 
02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
well i i think i'd like to see those
 
02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:26.310 align:start position:0%
well i i think i'd like to see those
numbers

02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
because they're talking in 23 and 24
 
02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:30.870 align:start position:0%
because they're talking in 23 and 24
those

02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:02:36.149 --> 02:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
could end up being a horrible hits
 
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
right and 24 could be as much as
 
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the interest and dividend
 
02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:43.910 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the interest and dividend
tax

02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
tax
 
02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
all right but could we
 
02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
also consider on
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
two statements one for what they're
 
02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:00.390 align:start position:0%
two statements one for what they're
getting

02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
getting
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
having credit this year and a different
 
02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
percentage required to take off from
 
02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:11.830 align:start position:0%
percentage required to take off from
past

02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
representatives this is carolyn again i
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
think the
 
02:03:18.709 --> 02:03:18.719 align:start position:0%
the difficulty with that is that um
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
if not statutorily at least in our
 
02:03:22.709 --> 02:03:22.719 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
we always account for the oldest
 
02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
money first so and that's you know
 
02:03:32.229 --> 02:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
consistent with generally accepted
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
accounting principles so the cco
 
02:03:39.750 --> 02:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's on their account is always or
 
02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:40.719 align:start position:0%
almost always
 
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
new it's only for the very very
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
largest dollar values of ccos that you
 
02:03:46.639 --> 02:03:48.149 align:start position:0%
largest dollar values of ccos that you
could

02:03:48.149 --> 02:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
that would save you anything um
 
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
because we're always using the taxpayers
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
old money first to pay their liability
 
02:04:01.109 --> 02:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
i miss a chair there are a number of
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
people with hands up i just opened mine
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
up and i noticed that nice
 
02:04:06.790 --> 02:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
i go there i should be at the back of
 
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
the line i was just going to
 
02:04:13.109 --> 02:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
go there and so that the first one
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
as here's the order would be a browning
 
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
early spillsbury
 
02:04:21.589 --> 02:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
and yourself so representative
 
02:04:23.669 --> 02:04:23.679 align:start position:0%
yeah norma i think we've really got to
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
do something about this one
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
um i think when we talk to finance
 
02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:32.719 align:start position:0%
i mean this is going to be quite a hit
 
02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
definitely in 23 and 24 but 23s
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know within the the budget year
 
02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
they're trying to deal with
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
um wow um
 
02:04:48.629 --> 02:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
i i think i think we we should we should
 
02:04:50.950 --> 02:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
we should give him the number as it is
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
but then say you know there's
 
02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to modify this hb2
 
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh line and uh and move this and spread
 
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
it out over the
 
02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
longer period of time but i mean i have
 
02:05:04.550 --> 02:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
a question for
 
02:05:06.149 --> 02:05:06.159 align:start position:0%
for carolyn that so you're saying that
 
02:05:08.069 --> 02:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
the auditors
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
are who who's telling us to do this the
 
02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:11.589 align:start position:0%
are who who's telling us to do this the
auditors

02:05:11.589 --> 02:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
auditors
 
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
oh um no i we weren't i
 
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
this was a um was within the governor's
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
proposal so i think it's fair to say
 
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
that if it
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
comes from the governor's office i don't
 
02:05:26.470 --> 02:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
believe that the auditors directed us to
 
02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
do this
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
um i think it was just a proposed
 
02:05:30.239 --> 02:05:31.270 align:start position:0%
um i think it was just a proposed
solution

02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
solution
 
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
to what has been an ongoing issue
 
02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know if you don't do this
 
02:05:42.629 --> 02:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
it could be if the big guys got together
 
02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
and said
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
hey we want to refund
 
02:05:49.950 --> 02:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
on our money right now and there's like
 
02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:51.270 align:start position:0%
on our money right now and there's like
279

02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
279
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
million dollars and and 220 million
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
from these guys that would be
 
02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:00.870 align:start position:0%
from these guys that would be
devastating

02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
devastating
 
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
but norm anybody can ask for a refund
 
02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:06:06.550 --> 02:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
no one's no one's twisting them their
 
02:06:09.109 --> 02:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
arms to say to keep that money the
 
02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
individual companies that are keep
 
02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
saying keep the money
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason oh there's a
 
02:06:18.950 --> 02:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
possibility that this could happen
 
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah and i've always been afraid
 
02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
europe thank you that
 
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
following up with what uh representative
 
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.149 --> 02:06:40.159 align:start position:0%
language on this needs to be going
 
02:06:40.159 --> 02:06:42.069 align:start position:0%
language on this needs to be going
forward

02:06:42.069 --> 02:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how we write that
 
02:06:47.830 --> 02:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
um i don't mind eliminating it it's a
 
02:06:49.030 --> 02:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
good idea and it should have been
 
02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:49.589 align:start position:0%
good idea and it should have been
limited

02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
limited
 
02:06:51.430 --> 02:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
some time ago i mean you know we've
 
02:06:52.709 --> 02:06:52.719 align:start position:0%
discussed this
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
year after year after year and
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
businesses have been just taking this as
 
02:06:57.119 --> 02:06:57.990 align:start position:0%
businesses have been just taking this as
a

02:06:57.990 --> 02:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh in the bank type of uh
 
02:07:04.390 --> 02:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
thing for uh or a rainy day fund if you
 
02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:05.109 align:start position:0%
thing for uh or a rainy day fund if you
will

02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:07:08.229 --> 02:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
so carolyn
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh if the state were to say what you
 
02:07:12.550 --> 02:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
have now
 
02:07:14.950 --> 02:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
is lost money that would open up the
 
02:07:17.350 --> 02:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
state to a bunch of suits i believe
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
i mean a lot of suits and all the money
 
02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
would have to be regurgitated at one
 
02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:22.629 align:start position:0%
would have to be regurgitated at one
time

02:07:22.629 --> 02:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
um should the wording be going forward
 
02:07:28.550 --> 02:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
no more shall apply
 
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
and any uh credits due will be taken
 
02:07:34.229 --> 02:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
from the credits already paid
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
is something like that would that be
 
02:07:40.709 --> 02:07:40.719 align:start position:0%
more appropriate
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
i think because this bill has an
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
applicability date
 
02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
um that that is essentially what it does
 
02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
um it applies to gosh i should have it
 
02:07:56.950 --> 02:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
right in front of me but i believe it's
 
02:07:59.589 --> 02:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
taxable periods ending on or after
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
december 31st 2022 but melissa you can
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
jump in if i'm misspeaking there
 
02:08:09.270 --> 02:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
um so it really will only apply
 
02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
um to credits
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
that are being carried forward going
 
02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:16.390 align:start position:0%
that are being carried forward going
forward

02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
um i think the issue that
 
02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
a representative um almi brought up
 
02:08:26.470 --> 02:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
is that there's all there's this large
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
volume of
 
02:08:30.229 --> 02:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
old credits going forward and
 
02:08:34.310 --> 02:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
is there some way to prevent the massive
 
02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact um when the bill takes
 
02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:38.229 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact um when the bill takes
effect

02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
effect
 
02:08:41.669 --> 02:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
and i think the only way to effectively
 
02:08:42.550 --> 02:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
do that
 
02:08:46.069 --> 02:08:46.079 align:start position:0%
is to modify the percentage
 
02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
measuring point that you're using um
 
02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
because of how we account for credits in
 
02:08:54.629 --> 02:08:54.639 align:start position:0%
accordance with generally accepted
 
02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
accounting principles
 
02:08:59.830 --> 02:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
um every every time a taxpayer files a
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
return the credit essentially becomes a
 
02:09:06.149 --> 02:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
what you're saying then is that this f
 
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
unless something like this bill takes
 
02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:17.030 align:start position:0%
unless something like this bill takes
place

02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
the credit is going to continue to
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
accumulate at least on paper
 
02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
forever and it will keep multiplying
 
02:09:25.199 --> 02:09:25.750 align:start position:0%
forever and it will keep multiplying
like

02:09:25.750 --> 02:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
rabbits if uh we're not if we don't put
 
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:36.149 --> 02:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
absent some sort of modification in
 
02:09:36.159 --> 02:09:37.109 align:start position:0%
absent some sort of modification in
taxpayer

02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
behavior i think it is likely
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
that the credit will at least stay the
 
02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:44.550 align:start position:0%
that the credit will at least stay the
same

02:09:44.550 --> 02:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:09:48.229 --> 02:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
um for whatever reason we have some
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
mostly larger taxpayers that carry
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
large credits on their account
 
02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
um and for whatever reason they don't
 
02:09:59.109 --> 02:09:59.119 align:start position:0%
choose to take a refund
 
02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
and they don't choose to modify down
 
02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
their estimated tax payments
 
02:10:06.550 --> 02:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
and as a result that credit just sits
 
02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:07.430 align:start position:0%
and as a result that credit just sits
there

02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
um and i don't know that we have any
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
signal that taxpayers are going to
 
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
change that behavior right now
 
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
i agree thank you mr chair
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative spells very
 
02:10:22.229 --> 02:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
followed by representative james
 
02:10:26.709 --> 02:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
and bernstein thank you mr chairman uh
 
02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
i think we're all trying to untangle
 
02:10:30.790 --> 02:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
this because there's
 
02:10:32.709 --> 02:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
several different perspectives of
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
looking at the same number
 
02:10:37.109 --> 02:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly trying to um but there's a
 
02:10:39.270 --> 02:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know your balance sheet perspective
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
versus your cash flow perspective
 
02:10:45.589 --> 02:10:45.599 align:start position:0%
when i look at this i guess i'm
 
02:10:46.950 --> 02:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
wondering what the treasurer
 
02:10:51.189 --> 02:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
has to say about the impact on liquidity
 
02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
if there was suddenly a call in the
 
02:10:56.470 --> 02:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
amounts at the higher end of the range
 
02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:56.950 align:start position:0%
amounts at the higher end of the range
for

02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:11:01.750 --> 02:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
23.24 but from a budgeting perspective
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
am i am i correct in thinking that this
 
02:11:05.189 --> 02:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
is really uh
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
not a factor it's it's a neutral these
 
02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:08.390 align:start position:0%
not a factor it's it's a neutral these
are

02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
effectively prepayments
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
against future liability but when we
 
02:11:13.679 --> 02:11:15.189 align:start position:0%
against future liability but when we
budget

02:11:15.189 --> 02:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:11:18.550 --> 02:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
we're not budgeting according to
 
02:11:22.950 --> 02:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
what people overpay in their estimates
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
and accumulates we're budgeting based on
 
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
the anticipated liability
 
02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh the net actual tax so
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
if i've got it right i'd like to hear
 
02:11:35.669 --> 02:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
from the treasurer
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
but i don't think there's a budget
 
02:11:48.149 --> 02:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
i do think that question is best posed
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
to the treasurer
 
02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:55.599 align:start position:0%
um i will say that we count those
 
02:11:57.910 --> 02:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
dollars you know those credits that are
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
sitting on taxpayer accounts
 
02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
are recognized in revenue in the year
 
02:12:04.870 --> 02:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
that they're received
 
02:12:08.470 --> 02:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
even though they will be used to pay a
 
02:12:10.149 --> 02:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
tax liability
 
02:12:13.189 --> 02:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
in a later year theoretically
 
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
um so i think that is sort of the crux
 
02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
of the issue
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
as to why this is a is potentially a
 
02:12:21.599 --> 02:12:22.310 align:start position:0%
as to why this is a is potentially a
problem

02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:12:26.950 --> 02:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
the cco issue is a problem from um
 
02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
a state annual financial report
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
situation and is why we've
 
02:12:34.709 --> 02:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
had to book a liability in the past
 
02:12:38.310 --> 02:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
to reflect that fact hey chris can you
 
02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
get the treasurer to
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
meet with us next wednesday yeah i can
 
02:12:43.589 --> 02:12:43.599 align:start position:0%
invite her
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
yep you bring up a good point in
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
representation this whole thing scares
 
02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
the heck out of me
 
02:12:53.589 --> 02:12:53.599 align:start position:0%
well and it's just to make an analogy to
 
02:12:55.350 --> 02:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
business it sounds like this is being
 
02:12:56.550 --> 02:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
dealt with
 
02:12:58.950 --> 02:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
on a cash accounting basis essentially
 
02:13:02.069 --> 02:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
rather than an accrual basis
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
right the cash is in the door they'll
 
02:13:06.149 --> 02:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
spend it
 
02:13:12.229 --> 02:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:16.390 --> 02:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
represented hey uh
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
bernstein and ames and software sorry
 
02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair basically
 
02:13:24.950 --> 02:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
everything i had to say has
 
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
pretty much been said already this is an
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
election by the taxpayer
 
02:13:31.109 --> 02:13:31.119 align:start position:0%
it's really an interest-free loan to the
 
02:13:32.950 --> 02:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
state um
 
02:13:36.790 --> 02:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
maybe the reason why it's growing
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
on a nominal basis so much as we're in a
 
02:13:40.310 --> 02:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
very low
 
02:13:41.910 --> 02:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
interest rate environment so the
 
02:13:44.069 --> 02:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity cost is pretty low
 
02:13:46.470 --> 02:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
letting the state take you keep your
 
02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:48.069 align:start position:0%
letting the state take you keep your
money

02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:55.589 --> 02:13:55.599 align:start position:0%
the pain that we're going to endure uh
 
02:13:57.189 --> 02:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
just seems unnecessary
 
02:14:00.229 --> 02:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh by having to refund this money i i
 
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
don't know i'll be interested to hear
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
what the treasurer has to say next week
 
02:14:05.189 --> 02:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
i really don't have a question uh but
 
02:14:06.950 --> 02:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
ramble roxanne ames
 
02:14:13.990 --> 02:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um to a significant
 
02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:14.550 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um to a significant
extent

02:14:14.550 --> 02:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
extent
 
02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
my question was answered by the question
 
02:14:19.589 --> 02:14:19.599 align:start position:0%
asked by
 
02:14:23.669 --> 02:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh representative spillsbury um
 
02:14:26.709 --> 02:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
i was gonna put it as but
 
02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
but i from what carolyn lear just said
 
02:14:33.189 --> 02:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
the question might my answer to my
 
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question
 
02:14:37.510 --> 02:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
is not the same i was going to say isn't
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
this really a department of treasury
 
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
issue rather than a revenue issue but i
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
i now i think i understand that
 
02:14:50.229 --> 02:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
this money that's kept
 
02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's left by the taxpayer that's
 
02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
essentially what's happening
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
left by the taxpayer with dra is being
 
02:14:58.390 --> 02:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
counted as revenue
 
02:15:02.069 --> 02:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
yes which i think is the crux of the
 
02:15:02.079 --> 02:15:02.870 align:start position:0%
yes which i think is the crux of the
problem

02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
um it's not you know it's the taxpayers
 
02:15:08.310 --> 02:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
money that's sitting up there
 
02:15:13.510 --> 02:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
and somebody else referred to it as a
 
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
interest-free loan by the taxpayer to
 
02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
the state i think
 
02:15:20.069 --> 02:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
that's what it looks like to me so if
 
02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer pulls down
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
some of that money to apply against a
 
02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:26.790 align:start position:0%
some of that money to apply against a
new

02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
new
 
02:15:30.709 --> 02:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
tax liability that's
 
02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
revenue to the state but if the taxpayer
 
02:15:35.589 --> 02:15:35.599 align:start position:0%
pulls that down into
 
02:15:38.530 --> 02:15:38.540 align:start position:0%
whatever his own account
 
02:15:38.540 --> 02:15:39.669 align:start position:0%
whatever his own account
[Music]

02:15:39.669 --> 02:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
then it's it's not
 
02:15:45.589 --> 02:15:45.599 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be lost revenue to the
 
02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
state it should be
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
less money that the department of
 
02:15:53.669 --> 02:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
treasury has available to
 
02:15:56.149 --> 02:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
calculate you know what it needs to
 
02:15:57.589 --> 02:15:57.599 align:start position:0%
calculate in terms of
 
02:16:00.709 --> 02:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
cash flow um so
 
02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a quandary where again as
 
02:16:03.750 --> 02:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
far as i can see
 
02:16:06.629 --> 02:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
and we're we've got a pattern of
 
02:16:06.639 --> 02:16:07.270 align:start position:0%
and we're we've got a pattern of
practice

02:16:07.270 --> 02:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
practice
 
02:16:11.109 --> 02:16:11.119 align:start position:0%
that has been followed by dra for a long
 
02:16:12.229 --> 02:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
time maybe i'm completely
 
02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding this by the way i'm no
 
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
expert in accounting um uh
 
02:16:23.350 --> 02:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
and the specter of having so much money
 
02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:32.309 --> 02:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to describe it so much
 
02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
money sitting there
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
that uh when it moves uh
 
02:16:39.669 --> 02:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
in the wrong direction could mess up the
 
02:16:39.679 --> 02:16:40.549 align:start position:0%
in the wrong direction could mess up the
state

02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
is what we're contending with but i
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
really don't
 
02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
i really don't understand why this is a
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:57.270 --> 02:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
revenue representative southworth
 
02:17:00.309 --> 02:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman we
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
often get wide ranges at this point when
 
02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
we're looking at things
 
02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if we look at the
 
02:17:08.070 --> 02:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
middle of
 
02:17:11.110 --> 02:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
the dras range the hump might
 
02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
not seem as terrible but am i correct
 
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
that after that hump is passed
 
02:17:17.349 --> 02:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
things are going to be much more
 
02:17:19.990 --> 02:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
predictable and we're going to be safe
 
02:17:21.669 --> 02:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
from the risk that you've been talking
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
about um chairman major for some time
 
02:17:26.790 --> 02:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
so is it a little bit like tearing the
 
02:17:28.629 --> 02:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
bandage off or whatever and
 
02:17:31.030 --> 02:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
maybe we do want to spread it out longer
 
02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:31.669 align:start position:0%
maybe we do want to spread it out longer
but

02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
will it in fact get us to a better place
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
caroline representative i think
 
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
the ripping the band-aid off analogy is
 
02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
a good one
 
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
i think that um what were you to do this
 
02:17:53.990 --> 02:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
um it would be a one-time
 
02:17:57.509 --> 02:17:57.519 align:start position:0%
impact and then going forward
 
02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
we would simply no longer allow
 
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
these significant accumulation of ccos
 
02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
on file um so in that way
 
02:18:13.110 --> 02:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:23.589 --> 02:18:23.599 align:start position:0%
yes thank you this further discussion
 
02:18:23.599 --> 02:18:24.070 align:start position:0%
yes thank you this further discussion
just

02:18:24.070 --> 02:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
prompts in my mind that this is a moving
 
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
target we're looking at
 
02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
and uh it would be interesting to see
 
02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
what this figure has been
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
you know maybe over a monthly basis for
 
02:18:35.589 --> 02:18:35.599 align:start position:0%
the last three years
 
02:18:37.750 --> 02:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering several things
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
that that might answer
 
02:18:42.469 --> 02:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
like we've seen a surge of uh
 
02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
business uh tax revenues uh
 
02:18:48.629 --> 02:18:48.639 align:start position:0%
over uh the estimates for this past year
 
02:18:52.070 --> 02:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
and is that in part due to uh an
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
escalation of prepayments
 
02:18:57.429 --> 02:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
or or is it truly that business
 
02:19:00.790 --> 02:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
taxes are generating more revenue
 
02:19:06.549 --> 02:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
what's the net
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
this has been growing every year
 
02:19:14.709 --> 02:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
over quite a few years um
 
02:19:17.349 --> 02:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
as far as far as growth goes as far as
 
02:19:19.589 --> 02:19:19.599 align:start position:0%
the rest of your question
 
02:19:22.709 --> 02:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
um actually i'm hoping melissa will
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
answer this question because she
 
02:19:29.349 --> 02:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
performs this calculation um i do think
 
02:19:31.990 --> 02:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
it definitely the number fluctuates so
 
02:19:34.309 --> 02:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps she could give um
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
a more detailed answer than i could but
 
02:19:37.830 --> 02:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
if not
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
tell me so melissa no thank you carolyn
 
02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
um we do report this in our in the tax
 
02:19:46.070 --> 02:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
expenditure report
 
02:19:48.549 --> 02:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
every year on a fiscal year basis for
 
02:19:49.510 --> 02:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
those of you
 
02:19:52.950 --> 02:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
interested um i can pull that up as we
 
02:19:54.309 --> 02:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
speak to let you know
 
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
the growth uh representative spillsbury
 
02:19:58.630 --> 02:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
it's a great question of saying
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
what is happening now are they
 
02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
um overpaying their liability and
 
02:20:09.349 --> 02:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
the cco is going to increase
 
02:20:10.710 --> 02:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
because they're just keeping that funds
 
02:20:12.790 --> 02:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
on file or is it a net decrease and
 
02:20:15.030 --> 02:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's hard to tell until all returns
 
02:20:18.309 --> 02:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
um until all returns are filed
 
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
if there's there's no way to know what
 
02:20:22.230 --> 02:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
those taxpayers are doing
 
02:20:24.389 --> 02:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis with those estimates
 
02:20:26.070 --> 02:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
if it's an overpayment or underpayment
 
02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:26.870 align:start position:0%
if it's an overpayment or underpayment
until

02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
until
 
02:20:30.070 --> 02:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
until the returns until the returns are
 
02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:31.429 align:start position:0%
until the returns until the returns are
filed

02:20:31.429 --> 02:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
filed
 
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
so just looking at um to give you some
 
02:20:34.800 --> 02:20:35.990 align:start position:0%
so just looking at um to give you some
perspective

02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
for credit carryovers on file
 
02:20:40.870 --> 02:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
i have in front of me which is our tax
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
expenditure report
 
02:20:49.030 --> 02:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 16 it was 173.4 million
 
02:20:53.790 --> 02:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year 17 it did decrease to
 
02:20:55.990 --> 02:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
171.8 million
 
02:20:58.389 --> 02:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
and then from fiscal year 17 on it has
 
02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
increased fiscal year 18
 
02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
196 million 19
 
02:21:08.230 --> 02:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 19 was a big jump to 268.1
 
02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:09.349 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 19 was a big jump to 268.1
million

02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
um and then fiscal year 20 is 271.6
 
02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:18.950 align:start position:0%
um and then fiscal year 20 is 271.6
million

02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:36.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
i think it's pretty clear that on we
 
02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
booked this money years ago
 
02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
and we spent this money in budgets
 
02:21:54.389 --> 02:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
so it is a revenue issue um
 
02:21:57.429 --> 02:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
the the question is
 
02:22:00.550 --> 02:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
how we get out of this and we have been
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
in this situation for two decades at
 
02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:03.670 align:start position:0%
in this situation for two decades at
least

02:22:03.670 --> 02:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
least
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
and probably longer than that um
 
02:22:11.910 --> 02:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
and and i i think we do need to look
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
at percentages of um
 
02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
what percentage would have to be
 
02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:20.550 align:start position:0%
what percentage would have to be
refunded

02:22:20.550 --> 02:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
refunded
 
02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
growing over a number of years whether
 
02:22:24.070 --> 02:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
that would help
 
02:22:27.429 --> 02:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
in the distribution of the pain on
 
02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
but i did want to ask if maybe we could
 
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
try to
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
approach bill ortinger who presumably
 
02:22:37.910 --> 02:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
talked to the governor about this
 
02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
and maybe the head of the society of
 
02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:42.150 align:start position:0%
and maybe the head of the society of
cpas

02:22:42.150 --> 02:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
cpas
 
02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
about we've never
 
02:22:48.309 --> 02:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
really explored this that i know of uh
 
02:22:48.319 --> 02:22:49.429 align:start position:0%
really explored this that i know of uh
how

02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:22:53.670 --> 02:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
why some of the businesses
 
02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
are are keeping the money there
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
one of our ideas earlier was that that
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
if they had to pay it
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
to get it all back suddenly they were
 
02:23:09.429 --> 02:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay higher taxes at the
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
02:23:13.349 --> 02:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
the federal taxes have gone down
 
02:23:13.359 --> 02:23:16.230 align:start position:0%
the federal taxes have gone down
somewhat

02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
considerably um but if
 
02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
if maybe we could get an idea from them
 
02:23:22.319 --> 02:23:23.030 align:start position:0%
if maybe we could get an idea from them
of

02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:23:26.309 --> 02:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
why this is being kept it might help or
 
02:23:27.510 --> 02:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
to figure out
 
02:23:30.830 --> 02:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
how much of it is going to disappear
 
02:23:30.840 --> 02:23:33.990 align:start position:0%
how much of it is going to disappear
when

02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:35.990 --> 02:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
we did have a discussion a number of
 
02:23:39.190 --> 02:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
years ago of why they were doing that
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
what they would have to pay on taxes if
 
02:23:47.349 --> 02:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
they brought it back out
 
02:23:49.270 --> 02:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
but representative romney would you take
 
02:23:51.270 --> 02:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
over for a few minutes i've got to
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
stop uh drop off the next question am i
 
02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
the next person
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
asking a question he wants you to take
 
02:23:58.790 --> 02:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
over the committee
 
02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
yeah am i know but um i guess i'm next
 
02:24:02.630 --> 02:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
to ask the question so
 
02:24:05.910 --> 02:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
this is for chris shea uh you know we
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
all we all look at the revenue focus
 
02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
every month
 
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
in my understanding that revenue focus
 
02:24:12.550 --> 02:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
is a cash document
 
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
so if credit carryovers in a particular
 
02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:17.270 align:start position:0%
so if credit carryovers in a particular
month

02:24:17.270 --> 02:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
month
 
02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
are exceed what they were the prior
 
02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:20.630 align:start position:0%
are exceed what they were the prior
month

02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
month
 
02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
that would show us a positive uh
 
02:24:26.389 --> 02:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
income or positive revenue the show is
 
02:24:26.399 --> 02:24:27.510 align:start position:0%
income or positive revenue the show is
positive

02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
positive
 
02:24:29.830 --> 02:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
in the revenue focus report now
 
02:24:31.349 --> 02:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
something magical happens my
 
02:24:33.910 --> 02:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is at the end of the year
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
where accrual accounting does come in
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
play somehow
 
02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
can you can you just give us a quickie
 
02:24:41.429 --> 02:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
on that uh
 
02:24:44.469 --> 02:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of what we look at every month
 
02:24:46.309 --> 02:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
is is cash
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
correct when we look at the credit
 
02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:49.910 align:start position:0%
correct when we look at the credit
carryover

02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
carryover
 
02:24:53.349 --> 02:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
that reflects any delta change
 
02:24:54.830 --> 02:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
from one month to another is that
 
02:24:57.030 --> 02:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
correct so
 
02:24:58.950 --> 02:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
so you're dealing on a cash basis every
 
02:25:01.349 --> 02:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
month that you look at the revenue focus
 
02:25:03.510 --> 02:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the year they do a
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
modified accrual
 
02:25:05.910 --> 02:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
and that's where there's a
 
02:25:09.030 --> 02:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
reconciliation that's performed against
 
02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:09.429 align:start position:0%
reconciliation that's performed against
the

02:25:09.429 --> 02:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:12.630 --> 02:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
carry credit forward which um as
 
02:25:15.910 --> 02:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh deputy commissioner lear has
 
02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's been some questions
 
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
over the years on how that's done
 
02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
and you know is there a better way to do
 
02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:22.950 align:start position:0%
and you know is there a better way to do
that

02:25:22.950 --> 02:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:25:25.270 --> 02:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
between the auditors dra and and
 
02:25:26.550 --> 02:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
treasurer and and
 
02:25:29.750 --> 02:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
um the comptroller's office um
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
but i can't give you a whole lot more
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
than that that's it's kind of out of my
 
02:25:34.870 --> 02:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
expertise area
 
02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
um it's really something i would defer
 
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
to um carolyn if she's got more insight
 
02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:39.990 align:start position:0%
to um carolyn if she's got more insight
or

02:25:39.990 --> 02:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:25:41.590 --> 02:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
we could have one one of our auditors
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
come on board to talk to you
 
02:25:46.550 --> 02:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
or even the comptroller yes
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
well i think yeah i know we asked for
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
the treasurer
 
02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh possibly the controller may be
 
02:25:54.070 --> 02:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
helpful too so
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i can i can invite her as well and
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
see if um that they could be on the call
 
02:25:59.830 --> 02:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
together maybe on
 
02:26:02.070 --> 02:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
on um wednesday when you guys are
 
02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:03.349 align:start position:0%

there's no more hands on this further
question

02:26:41.590 --> 02:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:26:46.950 --> 02:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:49.830 --> 02:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh i'm a freshman
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
on this committee so i just want to make
 
02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
sure i've got all of the facts straight
 
02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:53.910 align:start position:0%
sure i've got all of the facts straight
on

02:26:53.910 --> 02:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
on this issue that we're talking about
 
02:26:56.720 --> 02:26:57.750 align:start position:0%
on this issue that we're talking about
um

02:26:57.750 --> 02:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
i've got some statements and questions i
 
02:27:01.349 --> 02:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
just want to run over here and
 
02:27:03.270 --> 02:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
and you guys can correct me if i'm wrong
 
02:27:05.590 --> 02:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
but when we talk about whose money this
 
02:27:07.349 --> 02:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
is this is the taxpayer money that we're
 
02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
talking about correct
 
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
right and it's a credit carryover which
 
02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
is an
 
02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
overpayment by the taxpayer against
 
02:27:16.469 --> 02:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
their tax liability from an estimate
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
that they used correct
 
02:27:23.349 --> 02:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
okay so it can only be used to offset
 
02:27:24.950 --> 02:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
the liability on the business tax
 
02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:28.830 align:start position:0%
the liability on the business tax
payment

02:27:28.830 --> 02:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
correct

02:27:30.230 --> 02:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:27:33.270 --> 02:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
we need to get the the money that is in
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
this account
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
for each that of the overpayment by the
 
02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
by the taxpayer by the business taxpayer
 
02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:40.790 align:start position:0%
by the taxpayer by the business taxpayer
right

02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:27:42.870 --> 02:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
what's sitting out there and overpayment
 
02:27:44.790 --> 02:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
that they can use to offset their tax
 
02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:45.510 align:start position:0%
that they can use to offset their tax
payment

02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
payment
 
02:27:47.190 --> 02:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
can only be used for this purpose
 
02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:49.110 align:start position:0%
can only be used for this purpose
correct

02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
in the account can only be used to
 
02:27:51.359 --> 02:27:52.950 align:start position:0%
in the account can only be used to
offset

02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
offset
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
the business tax correct we need to get
 
02:27:59.349 --> 02:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
that squared away with the treasure
 
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
okay can it be used for anything else by
 
02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
the state while it's sitting in this
 
02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:05.270 align:start position:0%
the state while it's sitting in this
account

02:28:05.270 --> 02:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
account
 
02:28:07.190 --> 02:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
that needs to be answered by the
 
02:28:08.710 --> 02:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
treasurer okay
 
02:28:12.150 --> 02:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
and my last is more of a more of a
 
02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:14.070 align:start position:0%
and my last is more of a more of a
statement

02:28:14.070 --> 02:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
statement
 
02:28:18.230 --> 02:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
why is the overpayment portion of this
 
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:30.469 --> 02:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
i'm done okay and and we do a cash basis
 
02:28:33.349 --> 02:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
and then from the cash basis that's what
 
02:28:33.910 --> 02:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
we see
 
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
as revenue now the accountants
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
take over after that so it would be nice
 
02:28:42.389 --> 02:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
to get the squared away with the
 
02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
with the treasury uh i think there i
 
02:28:51.030 --> 02:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:55.349 --> 02:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative
 
02:28:58.870 --> 02:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
you muted susan while you were going
 
02:29:01.830 --> 02:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
on we established it might be good to
 
02:29:04.389 --> 02:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
have the comptroller as well
 
02:29:06.309 --> 02:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
and i still think it might be worth
 
02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
trying to talk with bill arden
 
02:29:10.389 --> 02:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
since he represents a lot of the big
 
02:29:10.399 --> 02:29:12.469 align:start position:0%
since he represents a lot of the big
businesses

02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
and then uh after we understand
 
02:29:34.710 --> 02:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:35.990 --> 02:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
the important thing for for
 
02:29:37.750 --> 02:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative nunes is that
 
02:29:39.830 --> 02:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
this has been recognized as an issue for
 
02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
a while
 
02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
these these credit carryovers are
 
02:29:44.870 --> 02:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
getting so large
 
02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
i think representative major and others
 
02:29:49.990 --> 02:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
have been very concerned about this
 
02:29:53.830 --> 02:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh now we got a proposal for a solution
 
02:29:55.349 --> 02:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
the only problem the only question we're
 
02:29:57.190 --> 02:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
trying to address now is
 
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
if if reducing this by 50 in one year or
 
02:30:00.240 --> 02:30:00.790 align:start position:0%
if if reducing this by 50 in one year or
whatever

02:30:00.790 --> 02:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know look like there's going to be
 
02:30:03.910 --> 02:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
some impact in a couple over a couple
 
02:30:03.920 --> 02:30:04.469 align:start position:0%
some impact in a couple over a couple
years

02:30:04.469 --> 02:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:30:06.950 --> 02:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
that are significant are those cash
 
02:30:06.960 --> 02:30:08.230 align:start position:0%
that are significant are those cash
impacts

02:30:08.230 --> 02:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
i think part of the answer is yes we're
 
02:30:12.389 --> 02:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
going to be writing checks back to
 
02:30:12.399 --> 02:30:13.030 align:start position:0%
going to be writing checks back to
people

02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:30:15.910 --> 02:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to be writing checks going
 
02:30:17.349 --> 02:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
the other way
 
02:30:19.270 --> 02:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be minus revenue the
 
02:30:21.349 --> 02:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
way we seem to do our revenue so but
 
02:30:22.309 --> 02:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to verify
 
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
all of that so yes this is an issue
 
02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
that's been
 
02:30:30.070 --> 02:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
out there and we
 
02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
but all of a sudden we find an hb2
 
02:30:35.510 --> 02:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh a solution and that we're trying to
 
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
grapple with
 
02:30:38.550 --> 02:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
is the solution going to be how painful
 
02:30:40.150 --> 02:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
is that solution going to be
 
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:46.630 --> 02:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
i've been after the has done this for
 
02:30:46.640 --> 02:30:48.389 align:start position:0%
i've been after the has done this for
years

02:30:48.389 --> 02:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ames and thank
 
02:31:14.550 --> 02:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
if we're willing to and i hate to beat
 
02:31:18.630 --> 02:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
this but it really is a fascinating
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
discussion but i don't mean to beat a
 
02:31:21.110 --> 02:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
dead horse
 
02:31:24.150 --> 02:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
if we're willing to refund the money to
 
02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer
 
02:31:27.429 --> 02:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
then we're willing to put the money in
 
02:31:29.349 --> 02:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
escrow to ease
 
02:31:32.710 --> 02:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
concerns about uh a mad rush of everyone
 
02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
asking for refunds
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
but by automatically refunding this
 
02:31:39.110 --> 02:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
money we sort of take a tool
 
02:31:41.030 --> 02:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
out of the accountant's toolkit to
 
02:31:42.790 --> 02:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
minimize new hampshire
 
02:31:46.230 --> 02:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
businesses federal tax liability
 
02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
so um it's just something we could
 
02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
we should consider um and i look forward
 
02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:53.110 align:start position:0%
we should consider um and i look forward
to

02:31:53.110 --> 02:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:31:56.389 --> 02:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
continuing the discussion but it's
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:05.510 --> 02:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative followed by
 
02:32:07.270 --> 02:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
02:32:11.030 --> 02:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um this the the idea
 
02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the federal
 
02:32:15.830 --> 02:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
um tax burden being increased
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
by getting the refund confuses me a bit
 
02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:19.910 align:start position:0%
by getting the refund confuses me a bit
because

02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:32:23.190 --> 02:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
when i do my taxes if i don't ask for a
 
02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:25.030 align:start position:0%
when i do my taxes if i don't ask for a
refund

02:32:25.030 --> 02:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
refund
 
02:32:28.870 --> 02:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
i still get a 1099 g the next year
 
02:32:31.110 --> 02:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
and it and that can add to my federal
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
tax liability so i'm not
 
02:32:34.710 --> 02:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
i could be wrong but i don't think
 
02:32:36.070 --> 02:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's refunded or not
 
02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
affects the federal tax liability at
 
02:32:39.990 --> 02:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
least in my own experience so i guess i
 
02:32:41.510 --> 02:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
would like to hear
 
02:32:44.230 --> 02:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
um also whether that's that's true or
 
02:32:44.240 --> 02:32:47.990 align:start position:0%
um also whether that's that's true or
not

02:32:47.990 --> 02:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:50.790 --> 02:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
that's a good question because when they
 
02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
pay their taxes
 
02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
that means that tax is deducted
 
02:33:01.030 --> 02:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
from their earnings federally
 
02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
and if they get a refund then they have
 
02:33:05.110 --> 02:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
to put it back in
 
02:33:08.070 --> 02:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
and take the taxes on it and it would be
 
02:33:09.349 --> 02:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
nice to know if that's
 
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:17.110 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:19.429 --> 02:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wanted to say that this
 
02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
discussion has been great and uh
 
02:33:24.309 --> 02:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's revealed that this this
 
02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh language uh
 
02:33:29.910 --> 02:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
has an impact if it's not changed it
 
02:33:31.030 --> 02:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
will have an impact
 
02:33:34.389 --> 02:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
and uh um it's a negative impact on
 
02:33:36.550 --> 02:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
revenues the way it's being expressed
 
02:33:37.750 --> 02:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:33:41.270 --> 02:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
so that uh that needs to be understood
 
02:33:42.710 --> 02:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
and factored in if it
 
02:33:45.270 --> 02:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh or it can or it needs to be changed
 
02:33:46.070 --> 02:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:33:47.429 --> 02:33:47.439 align:start position:0%
we need to get on top of this pretty
 
02:33:49.830 --> 02:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
quickly you don't
 
02:33:52.950 --> 02:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
know how well i feel when i hear you say
 
02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:53.910 align:start position:0%
know how well i feel when i hear you say
that

02:33:53.910 --> 02:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:33:53.920 --> 02:34:00.230 align:start position:0%
that
no

02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:02.309 --> 02:34:02.319 align:start position:0%
susan's smiling but she knows i've been
 
02:34:03.910 --> 02:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
at it for many years
 
02:34:07.110 --> 02:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
and this could have carried over
 
02:34:12.870 --> 02:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:23.270 --> 02:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:29.190 --> 02:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
next has to do with section 135-136
 
02:34:31.349 --> 02:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
which provides that proceeds from the
 
02:34:33.510 --> 02:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
sale that resulted from money provided
 
02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
by the highway fund
 
02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
for payback of real property purchase
 
02:34:39.030 --> 02:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
with federal funds
 
02:34:40.550 --> 02:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
should be credited to the department of
 
02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
transportation for the purpose of
 
02:34:43.830 --> 02:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
meeting federal obligations or
 
02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:45.510 align:start position:0%
meeting federal obligations or
reimbursing

02:34:45.510 --> 02:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursing
 
02:34:47.670 --> 02:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
the highway fund for payments of federal
 
02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:52.230 align:start position:0%
the highway fund for payments of federal
obligations

02:34:52.230 --> 02:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:59.429 --> 02:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
chris you want to elaborate
 
02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
so what i think i think all they're
 
02:35:04.070 --> 02:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
trying to do there is include federal
 
02:35:07.429 --> 02:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
um so essentially what happens when
 
02:35:09.830 --> 02:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
the dot disposes of property and it gets
 
02:35:11.670 --> 02:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
approved by the
 
02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
long-range committee is that if it was
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
bought with highway funds or turnpike
 
02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:16.790 align:start position:0%
bought with highway funds or turnpike
funds

02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
it goes back to that home fund in some
 
02:35:21.110 --> 02:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
cases they have a matching federal
 
02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:22.230 align:start position:0%
cases they have a matching federal
dollar

02:35:22.230 --> 02:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
and the feds have allowed them to hold
 
02:35:25.349 --> 02:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
that money and i think they're just
 
02:35:26.790 --> 02:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
incorporate that into the statute that
 
02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:29.830 align:start position:0%
incorporate that into the statute that
um

02:35:29.830 --> 02:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
allows them to dispose of property that
 
02:35:32.950 --> 02:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
that if they do have something that was
 
02:35:34.150 --> 02:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
bought with federal money and it's
 
02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:35.190 align:start position:0%
bought with federal money and it's
allowable

02:35:35.190 --> 02:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
allowable
 
02:35:37.110 --> 02:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
they could deposit it into one of their
 
02:35:38.950 --> 02:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
accounts be it the highway fund
 
02:35:42.550 --> 02:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
turnpike fund or a separate account
 
02:35:45.590 --> 02:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
so what i see on this item
 
02:35:47.990 --> 02:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
is the only way it could affect revenues
 
02:35:49.270 --> 02:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
to the highway
 
02:35:52.950 --> 02:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
is is if they had other things that they
 
02:35:54.950 --> 02:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
could sell
 
02:35:57.990 --> 02:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
that would go the proceeds could go
 
02:35:59.910 --> 02:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
directly to the highway fund and that
 
02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
is something that the highway department
 
02:36:05.830 --> 02:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
the department patient should be
 
02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:07.110 align:start position:0%
the department patient should be
managing

02:36:07.110 --> 02:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
managing
 
02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
i don't see where sorry it
 
02:36:14.550 --> 02:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
affects us i would agree represent major
 
02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
it it's really it's just a way for them
 
02:36:18.710 --> 02:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
to kind of retain the federal dollar
 
02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:19.030 align:start position:0%
to kind of retain the federal dollar
that

02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:22.389 --> 02:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
they might still be allowed to spend
 
02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
still have to account for it it's it's
 
02:36:26.550 --> 02:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
not going to um
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
help your revenues anywhere particularly
 
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know it might match a highway fund
 
02:36:33.429 --> 02:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
purchase they might get permission to do
 
02:36:33.439 --> 02:36:34.230 align:start position:0%
purchase they might get permission to do
that

02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:36.070 --> 02:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
but i think they just wanted to um be
 
02:36:37.510 --> 02:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
clear that when they do have federal
 
02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:38.070 align:start position:0%
clear that when they do have federal
dollars

02:36:38.070 --> 02:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
associated with a property that they're
 
02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
holding it back that they're they're
 
02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:50.550 --> 02:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
all right i don't see any questions so
 
02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
we can move on
 
02:36:56.309 --> 02:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
the next is 62
 
02:37:00.550 --> 02:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
which is section 145 establish a body
 
02:37:07.590 --> 02:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:11.190 --> 02:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
legislation the appropriators
 
02:37:18.469 --> 02:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
and if they do then it would be
 
02:37:20.309 --> 02:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
something that would be monitored by the
 
02:37:27.030 --> 02:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
in section 163-164
 
02:37:37.590 --> 02:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
amend the regenerative manufacturing
 
02:37:39.750 --> 02:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
program into the workforce development
 
02:37:42.790 --> 02:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
student debt relief program
 
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
makes various changes of the program
 
02:37:45.990 --> 02:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
regarding definition
 
02:37:47.830 --> 02:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
eligibility and established commission
 
02:37:50.950 --> 02:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
to oversee the program
 
02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:54.230 align:start position:0%
to oversee the program
chris

02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:57.030 --> 02:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
what do you know about this um i know
 
02:37:58.830 --> 02:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
nothing about this
 
02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:00.450 align:start position:0%
nothing about this
um

02:38:00.450 --> 02:38:00.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:00.460 --> 02:38:05.429 align:start position:0%
um
[Laughter]

02:38:05.429 --> 02:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i can't help you with this
 
02:38:09.750 --> 02:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
at all i'd have to um
 
02:38:11.670 --> 02:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
ask one of our budget guys who's been
 
02:38:13.990 --> 02:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
working with division two of
 
02:38:15.590 --> 02:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
house finance to see what information
 
02:38:17.830 --> 02:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
they have related to this
 
02:38:24.230 --> 02:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:28.070 --> 02:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
all right is that um
 
02:38:30.309 --> 02:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
susan did you have any other items in
 
02:38:31.590 --> 02:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
the hospital too
 
02:38:34.630 --> 02:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
can i come back to this one because i
 
02:38:34.640 --> 02:38:35.190 align:start position:0%
can i come back to this one because i
believe

02:38:35.190 --> 02:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:38:37.990 --> 02:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
that what the governor is doing is
 
02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:38.630 align:start position:0%
that what the governor is doing is
taking

02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
taking
 
02:38:41.349 --> 02:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
the arms fund that we spent quite a lot
 
02:38:42.950 --> 02:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
of time on the
 
02:38:46.150 --> 02:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
regenerated manufacturing program
 
02:38:50.070 --> 02:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
and making it broadly into
 
02:38:54.150 --> 02:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
a workforce development program
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
and we one of the problems that we had
 
02:38:58.389 --> 02:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:39:02.070 --> 02:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
was that um they wanted
 
02:39:05.270 --> 02:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
five million dollars to be spent in
 
02:39:07.510 --> 02:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
student debt relief which is mentioned
 
02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:08.830 align:start position:0%
student debt relief which is mentioned
here

02:39:08.830 --> 02:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
on for the arms fund so that they'd have
 
02:39:13.349 --> 02:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
more people coming
 
02:39:17.190 --> 02:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
in to it on and
 
02:39:21.030 --> 02:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
they were on they wanted
 
02:39:23.030 --> 02:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire business finance
 
02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:24.070 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire business finance
authority

02:39:24.070 --> 02:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
authority
 
02:39:28.230 --> 02:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
to um find a way to get the money
 
02:39:32.630 --> 02:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
to spend on this and
 
02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
when it left our hands and
 
02:39:38.790 --> 02:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
for a year after when i was following up
 
02:39:41.190 --> 02:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
they hadn't figured out a way to get
 
02:39:43.750 --> 02:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
that money
 
02:39:47.429 --> 02:39:47.439 align:start position:0%
so the question is do we have
 
02:39:50.469 --> 02:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
anything to do with this since it came
 
02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
out of our committee in the first place
 
02:39:57.030 --> 02:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
or do we just leave it to someone else
 
02:39:58.790 --> 02:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
to try to figure out how you find
 
02:40:01.990 --> 02:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
money to pay for it chris is going to
 
02:40:05.590 --> 02:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
find out what do they want to do here
 
02:40:06.150 --> 02:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
what this
 
02:40:09.270 --> 02:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
is about i know that
 
02:40:10.710 --> 02:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
when we had the regenerative
 
02:40:12.389 --> 02:40:12.399 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and set aside
 
02:40:15.590 --> 02:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
five million dollars for tuition refund
 
02:40:17.510 --> 02:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
for those people
 
02:40:19.269 --> 02:40:19.279 align:start position:0%
that are going to be employed in the
 
02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
regenerative manufacturing
 
02:40:28.230 --> 02:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:30.309 --> 02:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
i think we need to get more information
 
02:40:34.950 --> 02:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
before we can go any further with this
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
and we'll try to have that available for
 
02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:39.190 align:start position:0%
and we'll try to have that available for
wednesday

02:40:39.190 --> 02:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
02:40:42.309 --> 02:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
did you when you looked at hospital too
 
02:40:45.510 --> 02:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
did you have any other items
 
02:40:50.550 --> 02:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
well there was a question which we can
 
02:40:54.550 --> 02:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
probably leave to the dedicated
 
02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
fund program uh committee
 
02:41:01.030 --> 02:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
on about the state heating system
 
02:41:04.710 --> 02:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
but it's probably okay the thing that
 
02:41:09.269 --> 02:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
on their the department of education is
 
02:41:10.389 --> 02:41:10.399 align:start position:0%
supposed to accept
 
02:41:12.950 --> 02:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
gifts and bequests to fund new hampshire
 
02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:13.750 align:start position:0%
gifts and bequests to fund new hampshire
scholars

02:41:13.750 --> 02:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
scholars
 
02:41:15.830 --> 02:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
for an accounting unit which ought to be
 
02:41:17.990 --> 02:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
a dedicated fund
 
02:41:21.110 --> 02:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
and there
 
02:41:24.870 --> 02:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
is in the index a reference to a
 
02:41:24.880 --> 02:41:25.510 align:start position:0%
is in the index a reference to a
transfer

02:41:25.510 --> 02:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund which is
 
02:41:29.110 --> 02:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
actually a transfer
 
02:41:31.670 --> 02:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund to the
 
02:41:32.550 --> 02:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
public school
 
02:41:35.389 --> 02:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund which was created in
 
02:41:35.399 --> 02:41:37.269 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund which was created in
2017

02:41:37.269 --> 02:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
2017
 
02:41:40.389 --> 02:41:40.399 align:start position:0%
and on there are a lot of errors in that
 
02:41:40.399 --> 02:41:41.510 align:start position:0%
and on there are a lot of errors in that
drafting

02:41:41.510 --> 02:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
drafting
 
02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know if the
 
02:41:49.429 --> 02:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
on lbao is is working on that
 
02:41:52.150 --> 02:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
aside from the first error which is the
 
02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:53.750 align:start position:0%
aside from the first error which is the
index

02:41:53.750 --> 02:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
index
 
02:41:57.510 --> 02:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
reference but those were the
 
02:42:01.510 --> 02:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
the main other things i do think
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
we ought to tell them about the 612s but
 
02:42:04.319 --> 02:42:04.870 align:start position:0%
we ought to tell them about the 612s but
um

02:42:04.870 --> 02:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:07.110 --> 02:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
rather than leave it to be cleaned up
 
02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:08.070 align:start position:0%
rather than leave it to be cleaned up
later

02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
later
 
02:42:11.590 --> 02:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
but i can i can do that myself
 
02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay has any anybody else in looking at
 
02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 2
 
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
come up with any items we haven't
 
02:42:18.160 --> 02:42:19.670 align:start position:0%
come up with any items we haven't
discussed

02:42:19.670 --> 02:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
02:42:21.830 --> 02:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
relative to that's going to affect
 
02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:22.790 align:start position:0%
relative to that's going to affect
revenues

02:42:22.790 --> 02:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
02:42:25.510 --> 02:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
norm i've had my hand up representative
 
02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:26.950 align:start position:0%
norm i've had my hand up representative
brownlee

02:42:26.950 --> 02:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
brownlee
 
02:42:30.309 --> 02:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh well yeah uh just on on that
 
02:42:31.830 --> 02:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
advanced regenerative manufacturing
 
02:42:33.429 --> 02:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
first i mean
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
jennifer has a footnote here that says
 
02:42:36.950 --> 02:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
this isn't typical
 
02:42:39.429 --> 02:42:39.439 align:start position:0%
ways and means policy change but she
 
02:42:40.790 --> 02:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
just included it
 
02:42:43.750 --> 02:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
because we were so involved with with uh
 
02:42:45.830 --> 02:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
regenerative manufacturing
 
02:42:50.150 --> 02:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
which brings me to may not be a bad idea
 
02:42:52.550 --> 02:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh when things slow down a bit in maybe
 
02:42:54.070 --> 02:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
april and may
 
02:42:57.030 --> 02:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
that we invite army over to give us an
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
update on
 
02:42:59.910 --> 02:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
how the whole advanced regenerative
 
02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:01.030 align:start position:0%
how the whole advanced regenerative
manufacturing

02:43:01.030 --> 02:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
02:43:03.429 --> 02:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
program is going this is an aside from
 
02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
this so
 
02:43:07.190 --> 02:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh this has triggered that thought
 
02:43:08.870 --> 02:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea
 
02:43:10.870 --> 02:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
so but here's my thing that the one
 
02:43:13.110 --> 02:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
other thing they had on the sheet
 
02:43:17.590 --> 02:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
was the addition of two of dra auditors
 
02:43:21.349 --> 02:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
and there was a positive revenue impact
 
02:43:23.590 --> 02:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
from that uh not on not on the sheet
 
02:43:25.429 --> 02:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
that jennifer generated but on the
 
02:43:26.950 --> 02:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
the budget sheet that we worked off
 
02:43:28.790 --> 02:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
about a month ago
 
02:43:32.710 --> 02:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
so they talked about a 0.7
 
02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
million dollar increase in revenue
 
02:43:39.750 --> 02:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
on 22 and 3.2 million dollar increase in
 
02:43:41.110 --> 02:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
revenue in
 
02:43:43.910 --> 02:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
23. the question i have is do we is this
 
02:43:45.750 --> 02:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
something we want to report
 
02:43:49.590 --> 02:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh verify and then report to finance
 
02:43:53.190 --> 02:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
i think it should be myself but um
 
02:43:55.429 --> 02:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
this is like a because they're going to
 
02:43:56.230 --> 02:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who are going to
 
02:43:56.240 --> 02:43:57.910 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who are going to
finalize

02:43:57.910 --> 02:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
finalize
 
02:43:59.349 --> 02:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
whether they're they're going to prove
 
02:44:01.349 --> 02:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
those additional order positions
 
02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
for the r8
 
02:44:07.830 --> 02:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and there were different categories
 
02:44:09.830 --> 02:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
of auditors
 
02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
and the amount was
 
02:44:18.230 --> 02:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
700 022 and 3.2 million
 
02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
23. right right i mean
 
02:44:23.349 --> 02:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
dra could explain that if you want them
 
02:44:26.710 --> 02:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
to or we could just accept that
 
02:44:32.150 --> 02:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
um melissa or carolyn
 
02:44:33.990 --> 02:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
carolyn lehrer assistant commissioner at
 
02:44:35.510 --> 02:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue
 
02:44:38.950 --> 02:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
um the the two additional auditor
 
02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:39.830 align:start position:0%
um the the two additional auditor
positions

02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
positions
 
02:44:41.750 --> 02:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
um were specifically i believe
 
02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:43.110 align:start position:0%
um were specifically i believe
multi-state

02:44:43.110 --> 02:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
multi-state
 
02:44:47.349 --> 02:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
auditors um these are the auditors that
 
02:44:50.790 --> 02:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
um audit our largest
 
02:44:53.830 --> 02:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
business uh the largest multinational
 
02:44:57.510 --> 02:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
businesses and um we did provide
 
02:45:01.030 --> 02:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
those revenue estimates
 
02:45:02.950 --> 02:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
smaller in year one because of the
 
02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
training requirements and the amount of
 
02:45:06.309 --> 02:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
time that it takes for auditors to get
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
up to speed
 
02:45:10.070 --> 02:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
but those are also our highest revenue
 
02:45:12.150 --> 02:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
producing auditors because of the size
 
02:45:14.550 --> 02:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
of the company that they typically audit
 
02:45:18.150 --> 02:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
so a much larger impact in year two
 
02:45:20.469 --> 02:45:20.479 align:start position:0%
but those numbers were directly from us
 
02:45:21.910 --> 02:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
based on our
 
02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
estimates based on prior experience
 
02:45:27.269 --> 02:45:27.279 align:start position:0%
right and that's a total of five
 
02:45:27.279 --> 02:45:28.710 align:start position:0%
right and that's a total of five
positions

02:45:28.710 --> 02:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
positions
 
02:45:32.790 --> 02:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
but but the the heavy positions of the
 
02:45:37.429 --> 02:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
multi national auditors
 
02:45:40.469 --> 02:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
that's right i believe um we typically
 
02:45:42.550 --> 02:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
expect them to generate around a million
 
02:45:43.830 --> 02:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
to a million and a half
 
02:45:46.630 --> 02:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
um in revenue a year once they're up and
 
02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:47.429 align:start position:0%
um in revenue a year once they're up and
running

02:45:47.429 --> 02:45:47.439 align:start position:0%
running
 
02:45:49.510 --> 02:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
and um lindsay did present i'm sorry
 
02:45:51.030 --> 02:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner steph did present
 
02:45:53.190 --> 02:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
yesterday to division one in house
 
02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:54.150 align:start position:0%
yesterday to division one in house
finance

02:45:54.150 --> 02:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
finance
 
02:45:57.110 --> 02:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
um and gave them this information as
 
02:45:57.990 --> 02:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
well so they do
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
have the information about the expected
 
02:46:02.389 --> 02:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
revenue from those positions
 
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:17.269 --> 02:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
or legislation
 
02:46:20.309 --> 02:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:22.870 --> 02:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
can affect revenue that could possibly
 
02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
be used in hospital
 
02:46:27.269 --> 02:46:27.279 align:start position:0%
too all right
 
02:46:32.550 --> 02:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:33.990 --> 02:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have anything else
 
02:46:37.670 --> 02:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
we going to deal with single
 
02:46:40.950 --> 02:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
satisfactory today
 
02:46:42.550 --> 02:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
what's that we're going to deal with
 
02:46:44.070 --> 02:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
single sales factor today
 
02:46:50.150 --> 02:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:53.590 --> 02:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
did you want to do that right now or
 
02:47:01.830 --> 02:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
if does that if it's the last thing
 
02:47:05.190 --> 02:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
maybe we should just get it done
 
02:47:08.389 --> 02:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
okay then let's do that
 
02:47:19.030 --> 02:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:22.630 --> 02:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:26.150 --> 02:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
norm yeah um i want to
 
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:40.230 --> 02:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh representative
 
02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
so uh ways and means passed house bill
 
02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:45.190 align:start position:0%
so uh ways and means passed house bill
281

02:47:45.190 --> 02:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
281
 
02:47:48.469 --> 02:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
a month or so ago went on consent
 
02:47:51.030 --> 02:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
calendar was 22 nothing vote
 
02:47:53.990 --> 02:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
um that was to move out the date of
 
02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
single sales factor
 
02:47:59.030 --> 02:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
from taxable periods ending on or after
 
02:48:02.469 --> 02:48:02.479 align:start position:0%
december 31st 2022
 
02:48:07.269 --> 02:48:07.279 align:start position:0%
moving that out to december 31st of 2026
 
02:48:09.750 --> 02:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
and that that way we would have more
 
02:48:12.630 --> 02:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
time to evaluate the impact
 
02:48:16.870 --> 02:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
of of market-based sourcing
 
02:48:18.469 --> 02:48:18.479 align:start position:0%
before we took the next step to single
 
02:48:21.190 --> 02:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
sales factor
 
02:48:24.150 --> 02:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
and this was all as a result of house
 
02:48:26.870 --> 02:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
bill 4 the last budget
 
02:48:29.670 --> 02:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
where the senate put in single sales
 
02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
factor we never really had an earrings
 
02:48:31.750 --> 02:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
on it
 
02:48:35.349 --> 02:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
etc so and we're we're
 
02:48:37.910 --> 02:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're as a house uh ways and means we
 
02:48:38.950 --> 02:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
tend to be a little more
 
02:48:42.070 --> 02:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh conservative about about some of
 
02:48:43.030 --> 02:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
these things and
 
02:48:45.110 --> 02:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
want more proof i guess
 
02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:46.630 align:start position:0%
want more proof i guess
[Music]

02:48:46.630 --> 02:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:48:51.510 --> 02:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
i think most of us and i i can recall
 
02:48:56.950 --> 02:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
the conversations
 
02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
were cognizant of house bill
 
02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
i mean of uh of single sas factor going
 
02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:03.590 align:start position:0%
i mean of uh of single sas factor going
into

02:49:03.590 --> 02:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:49:08.710 --> 02:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
into play especially in fiscal 2023
 
02:49:10.830 --> 02:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
and i think our estimates were based on
 
02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:12.150 align:start position:0%
and i think our estimates were based on
that

02:49:12.150 --> 02:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:49:17.590 --> 02:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
now in conversations with lynn ober
 
02:49:22.070 --> 02:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh once you understood house bill 281
 
02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
said that wow why don't we just put 281
 
02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
in house bill two
 
02:49:31.429 --> 02:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
but if we were to do that would that
 
02:49:33.510 --> 02:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
have what impact would that have on the
 
02:49:35.750 --> 02:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
02:49:41.110 --> 02:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
especially for fiscal 2023 now my
 
02:49:42.790 --> 02:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
and i i said well look i can only give
 
02:49:44.389 --> 02:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
you my opinion
 
02:49:46.710 --> 02:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
but we can meet as a committee to talk
 
02:49:48.070 --> 02:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
about this
 
02:49:50.630 --> 02:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
um i know when i looked at my numbers
 
02:49:52.870 --> 02:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
that i used
 
02:49:56.469 --> 02:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
that i factored in monies for
 
02:50:00.230 --> 02:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh i should say reduced my estimates
 
02:50:03.750 --> 02:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
for 2023 because of single sales factor
 
02:50:07.269 --> 02:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
so what i'd like to if we can as a group
 
02:50:07.279 --> 02:50:08.710 align:start position:0%
so what i'd like to if we can as a group
today

02:50:08.710 --> 02:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:50:13.269 --> 02:50:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh come to a consensus as to
 
02:50:16.950 --> 02:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
first do we think that if we put this
 
02:50:20.550 --> 02:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
to uh 281 into
 
02:50:24.790 --> 02:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
into the house bill 2 basically delaying
 
02:50:27.830 --> 02:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
the single sales factor would people
 
02:50:30.550 --> 02:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable and also
 
02:50:34.550 --> 02:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh increasing our revenue estimates
 
02:50:38.150 --> 02:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
for 23. um that's the question on the
 
02:50:38.160 --> 02:50:39.910 align:start position:0%
for 23. um that's the question on the
table

02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
table
 
02:50:43.429 --> 02:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
and you got to remember that the day of
 
02:50:48.150 --> 02:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
dra's low estimate was 840.1
 
02:50:51.670 --> 02:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
million and the high was this is then
 
02:50:53.110 --> 02:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
they increased it since then but i think
 
02:50:55.190 --> 02:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
we got to go to back to
 
02:50:58.389 --> 02:50:58.399 align:start position:0%
what we were working with a month ago uh
 
02:51:01.990 --> 02:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
the high was 899.8
 
02:51:06.230 --> 02:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh but we when we took the democrat
 
02:51:09.429 --> 02:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
average and the republican average came
 
02:51:11.830 --> 02:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
up with 840 million
 
02:51:15.349 --> 02:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
so we were at the at the absolute low
 
02:51:16.830 --> 02:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
end of the dra
 
02:51:19.750 --> 02:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
number okay now normally we don't go
 
02:51:21.349 --> 02:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
that low
 
02:51:22.710 --> 02:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
and i think part of the reason we want
 
02:51:25.349 --> 02:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
that low is cause a single sales factor
 
02:51:29.349 --> 02:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
i did quiz dra the other day
 
02:51:31.030 --> 02:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
about their estimates their original
 
02:51:32.830 --> 02:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
estimates of
 
02:51:36.710 --> 02:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
840.1 to 899.8
 
02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
and they did not factor in anything for
 
02:51:45.990 --> 02:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
single sales factor okay so uh
 
02:51:48.790 --> 02:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
basically uh because they felt it wasn't
 
02:51:48.800 --> 02:51:49.910 align:start position:0%
basically uh because they felt it wasn't
indeterminable

02:51:49.910 --> 02:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
indeterminable
 
02:51:51.190 --> 02:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
and we'll like if they could speak for
 
02:51:53.429 --> 02:51:53.439 align:start position:0%
themselves on this but
 
02:51:55.030 --> 02:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
that there'd be years that it would be
 
02:51:57.110 --> 02:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
good in years that may be bad
 
02:52:00.230 --> 02:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
but i know as a committee
 
02:52:03.590 --> 02:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
we took the view that it was going to be
 
02:52:06.790 --> 02:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
bad in terms of reducing revenues
 
02:52:10.550 --> 02:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
now you could all correct me that
 
02:52:12.389 --> 02:52:12.399 align:start position:0%
that i was wrong and that in that
 
02:52:15.269 --> 02:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
statement but i know personally
 
02:52:17.750 --> 02:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
i did and if i my recollection of the
 
02:52:17.760 --> 02:52:19.190 align:start position:0%
i did and if i my recollection of the
conversations

02:52:19.190 --> 02:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
02:52:22.469 --> 02:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
i think others did as well so
 
02:52:26.630 --> 02:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
um i mean i i i think there's
 
02:52:29.030 --> 02:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
i mean if we took it as a if we let's
 
02:52:29.830 --> 02:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
pause one number
 
02:52:32.389 --> 02:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
so we can have a conversation around it
 
02:52:32.950 --> 02:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:52:36.389 --> 02:52:36.399 align:start position:0%
the midpoint of the dras estimate
 
02:52:40.830 --> 02:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:44.190 --> 02:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
um the midpoint was uh
 
02:52:47.830 --> 02:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
869.95 million
 
02:52:51.030 --> 02:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
and if if
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
we say we could hit that midpoint
 
02:52:57.990 --> 02:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's about a 29.95 million difference
 
02:52:58.000 --> 02:52:58.550 align:start position:0%
that's about a 29.95 million difference
from

02:52:58.550 --> 02:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:53:00.710 --> 02:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
our estimate that we did so let's call
 
02:53:01.750 --> 02:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
it 30 million because
 
02:53:05.510 --> 02:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
let's round it so
 
02:53:08.710 --> 02:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
i i think there's something here if
 
02:53:11.750 --> 02:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
if we want again dear
 
02:53:14.950 --> 02:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
the finances willing to put this in hb2
 
02:53:18.389 --> 02:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
but they want to know a number so if if
 
02:53:19.670 --> 02:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
we were to do that
 
02:53:21.670 --> 02:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
would we increase our our revenue
 
02:53:21.680 --> 02:53:23.269 align:start position:0%
would we increase our our revenue
estimates

02:53:23.269 --> 02:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
02:53:25.110 --> 02:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
assuming there's no single sales factor
 
02:53:26.950 --> 02:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
so i'd just like to open up the
 
02:53:26.960 --> 02:53:28.550 align:start position:0%
so i'd just like to open up the
discussion

02:53:28.550 --> 02:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:53:31.590 --> 02:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
and uh you know
 
02:53:34.710 --> 02:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
with the fact that this single sales
 
02:53:36.230 --> 02:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
factor would be put on hold for a couple
 
02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:37.269 align:start position:0%
factor would be put on hold for a couple
years

02:53:37.269 --> 02:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:53:39.510 --> 02:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
make a difference in folks revenue
 
02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:42.230 align:start position:0%
make a difference in folks revenue
estimates

02:53:42.230 --> 02:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:46.309 --> 02:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
well the dra came out with revised
 
02:53:50.309 --> 02:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
estimates as of yesterday
 
02:53:53.750 --> 02:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
and for fy23
 
02:53:57.110 --> 02:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
they have 847.7
 
02:54:02.150 --> 02:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
as the low and 907.3 is the high
 
02:54:05.269 --> 02:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
and in these estimates
 
02:54:08.469 --> 02:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
melissa or caroline
 
02:54:11.750 --> 02:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
was there any impact for
 
02:54:17.190 --> 02:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative major this is carolyn
 
02:54:20.710 --> 02:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
lear assistant commissioner
 
02:54:24.710 --> 02:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
there is no accounting for the
 
02:54:27.110 --> 02:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
impact of single sales factor
 
02:54:27.120 --> 02:54:27.910 align:start position:0%
impact of single sales factor
apportionment

02:54:27.910 --> 02:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
02:54:31.030 --> 02:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
in our revenue estimates
 
02:54:35.429 --> 02:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
and then your your percentages that you
 
02:54:36.630 --> 02:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
use from growing
 
02:54:39.670 --> 02:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
from 22 to 21
 
02:54:42.630 --> 02:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
it was four percent on the low and and
 
02:54:47.110 --> 02:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:51.269 --> 02:54:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:54.389 --> 02:54:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:56.469 --> 02:54:56.479 align:start position:0%
well actually we really need to go right
 
02:54:59.269 --> 02:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
back to 21
 
02:55:04.309 --> 02:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
21 your estimate was 817 to 841.
 
02:55:06.469 --> 02:55:06.479 align:start position:0%
and then you grew that by one percent
 
02:55:07.910 --> 02:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
and three percent on the low and the
 
02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:08.309 align:start position:0%
and three percent on the low and the
high

02:55:08.309 --> 02:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
high
 
02:55:11.510 --> 02:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
going to 22. and then another four
 
02:55:11.520 --> 02:55:12.070 align:start position:0%
going to 22. and then another four
percent

02:55:12.070 --> 02:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:55:14.070 --> 02:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
and six percent for the high end low
 
02:55:18.469 --> 02:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
and there was no
 
02:55:25.590 --> 02:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
effect on single sales factor
 
02:55:29.910 --> 02:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
at that point in time that's correct our
 
02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:30.630 align:start position:0%
at that point in time that's correct our
growth

02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
growth
 
02:55:32.870 --> 02:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
percentages did not take into
 
02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:33.830 align:start position:0%
percentages did not take into
consideration

02:55:33.830 --> 02:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
02:55:36.950 --> 02:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
any impact from single sales factor
 
02:55:39.269 --> 02:55:39.279 align:start position:0%
and your revenue estimates that you came
 
02:55:40.950 --> 02:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
out with yesterday
 
02:55:43.830 --> 02:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
is based upon what you know as of
 
02:55:43.840 --> 02:55:44.870 align:start position:0%
is based upon what you know as of
yesterday

02:55:44.870 --> 02:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
02:55:49.190 --> 02:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
relative to the collection of revenues
 
02:55:52.230 --> 02:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
and the estimates today
 
02:55:55.110 --> 02:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
and the economy all these things you've
 
02:55:59.429 --> 02:55:59.439 align:start position:0%
taken those into account
 
02:56:01.990 --> 02:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
the the revenue estimates that melissa
 
02:56:03.910 --> 02:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
sent you yesterday and she can jump in
 
02:56:04.710 --> 02:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:56:07.429 --> 02:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
the only change in those estimates i
 
02:56:07.439 --> 02:56:07.910 align:start position:0%
the only change in those estimates i
believe

02:56:07.910 --> 02:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:56:10.950 --> 02:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
was to um
 
02:56:14.309 --> 02:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
change february to actual february
 
02:56:14.319 --> 02:56:15.269 align:start position:0%
change february to actual february
receipts

02:56:15.269 --> 02:56:15.279 align:start position:0%
receipts
 
02:56:16.950 --> 02:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
melissa do you want to jump in and
 
02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that
 
02:56:23.990 --> 02:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:26.070 --> 02:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
sure for the record melissa rollins
 
02:56:27.190 --> 02:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
department of revenue
 
02:56:30.550 --> 02:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
um yes the carolyn is absolutely correct
 
02:56:33.269 --> 02:56:33.279 align:start position:0%
the only change we did was to remove the
 
02:56:35.590 --> 02:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
february estimate that we had to replace
 
02:56:37.269 --> 02:56:37.279 align:start position:0%
with actual february
 
02:56:40.230 --> 02:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
in representative major to your point um
 
02:56:42.790 --> 02:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
i think it was noted in the email
 
02:56:45.750 --> 02:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
that we did remove the anomalous payment
 
02:56:47.990 --> 02:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
out of the base when growing fiscal year
 
02:56:49.190 --> 02:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
22 we removed
 
02:56:50.870 --> 02:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars knowing that that
 
02:56:52.710 --> 02:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't continue or we didn't
 
02:56:54.469 --> 02:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
anticipate that to continue
 
02:56:57.830 --> 02:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 22.
 
02:56:59.750 --> 02:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
we did not change any of our further
 
02:57:01.590 --> 02:57:01.600 align:start position:0%
assumptions we haven't dug into
 
02:57:04.630 --> 02:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
anything we intend to do that as march
 
02:57:08.230 --> 02:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
comes in and we have some more data
 
02:57:12.389 --> 02:57:12.399 align:start position:0%
okay and hopefully
 
02:57:16.150 --> 02:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:19.429 --> 02:57:19.439 align:start position:0%
18th you may have some data that's
 
02:57:22.790 --> 02:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
i hope and the reason we
 
02:57:27.429 --> 02:57:27.439 align:start position:0%
we have to do something by the 18th
 
02:57:31.590 --> 02:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
is because the finance committee has to
 
02:57:36.070 --> 02:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
be complete by early the next week
 
02:57:38.150 --> 02:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
mr chair there's two separate issues on
 
02:57:39.190 --> 02:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
the table
 
02:57:41.349 --> 02:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
there's next week's discussion about any
 
02:57:43.830 --> 02:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
revenue estimate changes
 
02:57:47.670 --> 02:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
and then there's our discussion today
 
02:57:51.830 --> 02:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
about did we or did we not
 
02:57:54.230 --> 02:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
factor in if we were to take out single
 
02:57:55.750 --> 02:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
sales factor
 
02:57:59.110 --> 02:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
from our discussion as if as in hold
 
02:58:03.269 --> 02:58:03.279 align:start position:0%
put a hold on it what in our revenues
 
02:58:05.510 --> 02:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
estimates have been higher when we did
 
02:58:07.429 --> 02:58:07.439 align:start position:0%
our original estimates
 
02:58:10.710 --> 02:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm trying to get at right
 
02:58:13.910 --> 02:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
so what you're trying to get is what did
 
02:58:16.550 --> 02:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
we factor in for a single sales factor
 
02:58:18.309 --> 02:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
and 23.
 
02:58:19.830 --> 02:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
right and i know we must have factored
 
02:58:21.429 --> 02:58:21.439 align:start position:0%
in something because i know
 
02:58:24.550 --> 02:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
we would not have been at 800 and
 
02:58:27.590 --> 02:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh our our our combined republican
 
02:58:27.600 --> 02:58:28.309 align:start position:0%
uh our our our combined republican
democrat

02:58:28.309 --> 02:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
democrat
 
02:58:31.990 --> 02:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
average was 840 million
 
02:58:35.030 --> 02:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:58:39.349 --> 02:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know the minimum at the dra level
 
02:58:42.710 --> 02:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
why would we go why would we base
 
02:58:44.870 --> 02:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
we never have done this where we go to
 
02:58:45.990 --> 02:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
the minimum
 
02:58:48.630 --> 02:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
of what the era said at the time not not
 
02:58:48.640 --> 02:58:49.030 align:start position:0%
of what the era said at the time not not
their

02:58:49.030 --> 02:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:58:51.590 --> 02:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
not their new estimates at the time of
 
02:58:52.790 --> 02:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
840 million
 
02:58:56.630 --> 02:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
so it's low uh very low
 
02:58:59.670 --> 02:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh and i to me
 
02:59:02.230 --> 02:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
it was that we we were hedging our bets
 
02:59:03.990 --> 02:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
on single sales factor
 
02:59:05.190 --> 02:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to put a hold on
 
02:59:07.190 --> 02:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
single sales factor
 
02:59:09.269 --> 02:59:09.279 align:start position:0%
my my gut tells me we should be
 
02:59:10.230 --> 02:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
increasing these
 
02:59:13.429 --> 02:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
these estimates yes but the question is
 
02:59:17.110 --> 02:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
how much if they put it into hb2 uh
 
02:59:22.469 --> 02:59:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:25.990 --> 02:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
and how much did a single sales factor
 
02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:26.870 align:start position:0%
and how much did a single sales factor
affect

02:59:26.870 --> 02:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
affect
 
02:59:33.190 --> 02:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:35.349 --> 02:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
mr chairman you have representative
 
02:59:37.750 --> 02:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
spillsberry and then you have me
 
02:59:40.870 --> 02:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
oh okay representative spellsbury thank
 
02:59:41.990 --> 02:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and
 
02:59:45.830 --> 02:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative holly um yeah
 
02:59:48.950 --> 02:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
just to confirm what pat is asking i had
 
02:59:50.870 --> 02:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
the deferral of single sales factor
 
02:59:54.150 --> 02:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
in mind in setting the estimates so i
 
02:59:55.910 --> 02:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
i understand the path he's trying to
 
02:59:57.510 --> 02:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
lead us on it makes sense
 
03:00:00.550 --> 03:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
my freshman question is uh
 
03:00:03.269 --> 03:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
i'm not clear as a matter of procedure
 
03:00:05.429 --> 03:00:05.439 align:start position:0%
what the advantages and disadvantages
 
03:00:05.439 --> 03:00:06.230 align:start position:0%
what the advantages and disadvantages
are

03:00:06.230 --> 03:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:00:09.510 --> 03:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
as to having hb 281
 
03:00:10.870 --> 03:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
go through the senate process
 
03:00:12.870 --> 03:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
independently versus getting
 
03:00:14.630 --> 03:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the budget
 
03:00:16.469 --> 03:00:16.479 align:start position:0%
is there an advantage for example
 
03:00:17.670 --> 03:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
allowing the
 
03:00:20.790 --> 03:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
finance committee to uh bank that
 
03:00:23.910 --> 03:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
into the budget or what is the issue one
 
03:00:24.870 --> 03:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
way or the other
 
03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
what it is is they want they want more
 
03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:28.870 align:start position:0%
what it is is they want they want more
revenue

03:00:28.870 --> 03:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
03:00:32.309 --> 03:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
by putting into the budget if they uh
 
03:00:36.830 --> 03:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
let's say we attracted 12 million
 
03:00:36.840 --> 03:00:39.590 align:start position:0%
let's say we attracted 12 million
dollars

03:00:39.590 --> 03:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:00:42.150 --> 03:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
so by incorporating it into hb2 that can
 
03:00:44.070 --> 03:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
take account of the revenue effect
 
03:00:46.870 --> 03:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
right so that thank you for each year
 
03:00:48.309 --> 03:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
they could raise the
 
03:00:50.550 --> 03:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
revenues that they have to play with by
 
03:00:52.630 --> 03:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
12 million
 
03:00:55.750 --> 03:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
also answer that question norm yes the
 
03:00:56.870 --> 03:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
odds of the senate
 
03:01:00.630 --> 03:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
agreeing with us on 281 is minimal
 
03:01:03.269 --> 03:01:03.279 align:start position:0%
given that this was their position last
 
03:01:03.279 --> 03:01:04.469 align:start position:0%
given that this was their position last
year

03:01:04.469 --> 03:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:01:09.349 --> 03:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:12.550 --> 03:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
does this help putting it into hp2 yeah
 
03:01:14.469 --> 03:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
it makes it a bigger fight
 
03:01:17.510 --> 03:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
i guess um you know the power brokers
 
03:01:17.990 --> 03:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
that be
 
03:01:21.030 --> 03:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
that are going to ultimately
 
03:01:23.349 --> 03:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
you know do whatever they do at the end
 
03:01:25.990 --> 03:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
of this budget negotiation
 
03:01:29.590 --> 03:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know we could win this fight by
 
03:01:32.870 --> 03:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
having it in hb2 uh
 
03:01:36.070 --> 03:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
and that and you know we're giving you
 
03:01:36.870 --> 03:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
we're giving the
 
03:01:39.110 --> 03:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
we're giving the house more money to to
 
03:01:40.469 --> 03:01:40.479 align:start position:0%
work with
 
03:01:42.230 --> 03:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
i know they'll be fighting pretty hard
 
03:01:44.710 --> 03:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
and the house finance guys
 
03:01:51.510 --> 03:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:55.429 --> 03:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:58.790 --> 03:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
put into our estimate
 
03:02:03.429 --> 03:02:03.439 align:start position:0%
to account for a single sales factor
 
03:02:06.710 --> 03:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
on fy23
 
03:02:08.230 --> 03:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to have to go back
 
03:02:12.630 --> 03:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:16.309 --> 03:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
in the meantime representative
 
03:02:19.830 --> 03:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
follow me thank you
 
03:02:23.830 --> 03:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
on i actually had an estimate that was 5
 
03:02:23.840 --> 03:02:24.389 align:start position:0%
on i actually had an estimate that was 5
million

03:02:24.389 --> 03:02:24.399 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:02:27.910 --> 03:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
lower than than
 
03:02:31.349 --> 03:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
the democrats put into the to the heap
 
03:02:33.750 --> 03:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
went along with the rest of them it was
 
03:02:33.760 --> 03:02:34.630 align:start position:0%
went along with the rest of them it was
based

03:02:34.630 --> 03:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
based
 
03:02:37.910 --> 03:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
on the single sales factor and
 
03:02:41.190 --> 03:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
it was based on a very conservative
 
03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:41.830 align:start position:0%
it was based on a very conservative
version

03:02:41.830 --> 03:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
version
 
03:02:45.510 --> 03:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
of what happened in 2018
 
03:02:49.190 --> 03:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
when all of that extra um
 
03:02:51.510 --> 03:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
tax money went back to the major
 
03:02:54.230 --> 03:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
corporations that we deal with from the
 
03:02:55.429 --> 03:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
03:02:59.030 --> 03:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
and we got to tax it on
 
03:03:02.230 --> 03:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
i took half of what that produced which
 
03:03:04.230 --> 03:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
was 68
 
03:03:07.830 --> 03:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
million and then i cut it down to 30
 
03:03:09.349 --> 03:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
which is exactly what
 
03:03:11.830 --> 03:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative abrami was talking about
 
03:03:13.830 --> 03:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
from a different angle
 
03:03:17.269 --> 03:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
on and struck that loss
 
03:03:20.389 --> 03:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
into to my personal estimate
 
03:03:23.590 --> 03:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
and i do feel that
 
03:03:26.550 --> 03:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
the largest corporations though we don't
 
03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:27.670 align:start position:0%
the largest corporations though we don't
know

03:03:27.670 --> 03:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:03:30.070 --> 03:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
what their mix is that's the trouble and
 
03:03:32.790 --> 03:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
dra can't tell us
 
03:03:36.870 --> 03:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
but that they have been doing quite well
 
03:03:38.950 --> 03:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic and are positioned
 
03:03:40.070 --> 03:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
to do quite well
 
03:03:43.269 --> 03:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
after the pandemic and that
 
03:03:48.070 --> 03:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
on they are the ones that
 
03:03:52.550 --> 03:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
that end up making more
 
03:03:56.309 --> 03:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
more than uh off of this
 
03:03:59.429 --> 03:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
than the the small corporations
 
03:04:01.269 --> 03:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
according to what we were
 
03:04:05.830 --> 03:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
were given and that they make
 
03:04:10.950 --> 03:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
on 10 million of the loss
 
03:04:14.790 --> 03:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
is given to them alone
 
03:04:18.230 --> 03:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
and the rest of it is split between the
 
03:04:22.630 --> 03:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
large and the small total corporations
 
03:04:25.510 --> 03:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
so the total loss that i was using was
 
03:04:26.389 --> 03:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
30 million
 
03:04:29.830 --> 03:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
which is what representative abrami came
 
03:04:29.840 --> 03:04:30.150 align:start position:0%
which is what representative abrami came
at

03:04:30.150 --> 03:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:04:32.350 --> 03:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
from a different different uh
 
03:04:32.360 --> 03:04:34.830 align:start position:0%
from a different different uh
[Music]

03:04:34.830 --> 03:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:04:37.269 --> 03:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
calculations due to the single sales
 
03:04:37.279 --> 03:04:38.230 align:start position:0%
calculations due to the single sales
factor

03:04:38.230 --> 03:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
factor
 
03:04:41.510 --> 03:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
um it is it's very been very variable
 
03:04:43.990 --> 03:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
in their calculations in the past we
 
03:04:45.030 --> 03:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
03:04:47.269 --> 03:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
and i think i took the five million off
 
03:04:48.710 --> 03:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
extra of the
 
03:04:52.550 --> 03:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
six million off extra from that because
 
03:04:55.429 --> 03:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
um we get some money back from
 
03:04:57.510 --> 03:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing
 
03:04:59.750 --> 03:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
on that they're pretty sure of but they
 
03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
haven't i think that's
 
03:05:03.590 --> 03:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
also not put into the dra revenue
 
03:05:03.600 --> 03:05:05.110 align:start position:0%
also not put into the dra revenue
estimate

03:05:05.110 --> 03:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
03:05:08.230 --> 03:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
yeah because they haven't got a final
 
03:05:12.070 --> 03:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:14.469 --> 03:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
so oh and i did want to say that i think
 
03:05:14.479 --> 03:05:15.269 align:start position:0%
so oh and i did want to say that i think
that

03:05:15.269 --> 03:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:05:18.870 --> 03:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
having it in hb2 puts the finance
 
03:05:20.150 --> 03:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
committee of the house
 
03:05:22.950 --> 03:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
behind this when we go into committee
 
03:05:22.960 --> 03:05:24.309 align:start position:0%
behind this when we go into committee
conference

03:05:24.309 --> 03:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
conference
 
03:05:26.870 --> 03:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
and they're the ones who get to talk
 
03:05:27.830 --> 03:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
mostly about
 
03:05:29.590 --> 03:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
what happens in that committee of
 
03:05:32.790 --> 03:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
conference and make the decisions
 
03:05:35.429 --> 03:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
and i'm hoping that if we can get a
 
03:05:35.439 --> 03:05:36.070 align:start position:0%
and i'm hoping that if we can get a
hearing

03:05:36.070 --> 03:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:05:39.670 --> 03:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
in the senate that maybe um with the
 
03:05:42.790 --> 03:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
information from 2018 that they will be
 
03:05:44.309 --> 03:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
feeling more cautious
 
03:05:47.030 --> 03:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
as senator d'alessandro seemed to be
 
03:05:49.269 --> 03:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
feeling more cautious when we had
 
03:05:53.349 --> 03:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
those um that special committee
 
03:05:56.790 --> 03:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:00.469 --> 03:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
okay representative ames
 
03:06:03.830 --> 03:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:06.790 --> 03:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i really hope that uh that fine
 
03:06:08.870 --> 03:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
house finance will put
 
03:06:12.070 --> 03:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
into house bill 2 this delay of
 
03:06:15.830 --> 03:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
single sales factor
 
03:06:19.429 --> 03:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
and i do think at least in my case
 
03:06:23.269 --> 03:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
the likelihood the single sales factor
 
03:06:25.030 --> 03:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
would be a negative
 
03:06:28.230 --> 03:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
factored into my uh
 
03:06:32.790 --> 03:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
personal input into that uh
 
03:06:35.990 --> 03:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
group calculation that we did
 
03:06:39.030 --> 03:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
as a as a negative um i
 
03:06:41.750 --> 03:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
i think that it should i would hope that
 
03:06:43.510 --> 03:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
it would be possible
 
03:06:47.269 --> 03:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh representative major to convey
 
03:06:50.630 --> 03:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
to the finance committee the sense of
 
03:06:51.750 --> 03:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
03:06:54.230 --> 03:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
at the sense the conviction of this
 
03:06:56.070 --> 03:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
committee that
 
03:06:59.269 --> 03:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
a single sales factor delay will be a
 
03:07:00.309 --> 03:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
positive for
 
03:07:02.950 --> 03:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
revenue without getting into
 
03:07:02.960 --> 03:07:04.150 align:start position:0%
revenue without getting into
[Music]

03:07:04.150 --> 03:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:07:07.190 --> 03:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
providing a number um at least until
 
03:07:10.630 --> 03:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
after we've done a calculation that
 
03:07:12.309 --> 03:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
looks at the whole picture because i
 
03:07:15.590 --> 03:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
know when i was doing my estimates i was
 
03:07:17.990 --> 03:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know the the the single sales factor
 
03:07:20.150 --> 03:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
was a negative but there were positives
 
03:07:20.160 --> 03:07:22.469 align:start position:0%
was a negative but there were positives
and

03:07:22.469 --> 03:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:25.670 --> 03:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
it all sort of comes together and
 
03:07:27.670 --> 03:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
combined calculation in a way that's
 
03:07:28.870 --> 03:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
hard to repeat
 
03:07:30.950 --> 03:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to be trying to do that next
 
03:07:32.070 --> 03:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
week i think
 
03:07:35.269 --> 03:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
um and yet yet we need to communicate
 
03:07:36.070 --> 03:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
with finance
 
03:07:39.030 --> 03:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
now why couldn't we do it in this more
 
03:07:40.710 --> 03:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
sort of general way
 
03:07:43.990 --> 03:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
um if indeed what i just said about the
 
03:07:46.469 --> 03:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
committee's position is accurate
 
03:07:50.870 --> 03:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
do you can you attribute
 
03:07:53.510 --> 03:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
a certain amount just to the single
 
03:07:55.750 --> 03:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
sales factor
 
03:07:58.389 --> 03:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
well um i'm hesitant to do that but i
 
03:08:00.469 --> 03:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say 30 million
 
03:08:03.830 --> 03:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
if it would be in the positive terrain
 
03:08:06.230 --> 03:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
and be five or ten million dollars but
 
03:08:08.469 --> 03:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
it might be more after we do a group
 
03:08:11.990 --> 03:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:18.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:08:18.230 --> 03:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:21.269 --> 03:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
then over seems to
 
03:08:24.550 --> 03:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
think it's 12.99 where did she get that
 
03:08:25.510 --> 03:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
number from
 
03:08:27.510 --> 03:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
what was that twelve point nine what
 
03:08:29.269 --> 03:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
twelve don't know
 
03:08:32.870 --> 03:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
what they were in the sales factor
 
03:08:32.880 --> 03:08:37.990 align:start position:0%
what they were in the sales factor
who

03:08:37.990 --> 03:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
chris

03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:45.190 --> 03:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
is chris still with us
 
03:08:48.710 --> 03:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
i am just trying to unmute
 
03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
um i don't know where reps of over got
 
03:08:52.230 --> 03:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
the number at 12.9
 
03:08:54.150 --> 03:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
but that sounds like the historical
 
03:08:58.230 --> 03:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:00.150 --> 03:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
so we'd have to check in with her on
 
03:09:03.349 --> 03:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
that right it's the historical racing
 
03:09:06.469 --> 03:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
they want to put that in the house
 
03:09:06.479 --> 03:09:12.870 align:start position:0%
they want to put that in the house
too

03:09:12.870 --> 03:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:16.389 --> 03:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
1229 is close to the average
 
03:09:20.950 --> 03:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
loss over 14 to 17 before they had the
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:27.269 --> 03:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
before market-based sourcing which is
 
03:09:28.830 --> 03:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
the key
 
03:09:28.840 --> 03:09:31.190 align:start position:0%
the key
problem

03:09:31.190 --> 03:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:09:43.750 --> 03:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:46.950 --> 03:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
all racing we we have some work to do
 
03:09:48.469 --> 03:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
can we give him some kind of a range
 
03:09:50.150 --> 03:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
don't norm
 
03:09:52.790 --> 03:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to want a number tomorrow
 
03:09:53.750 --> 03:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
if they're going to do this
 
03:09:55.030 --> 03:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
if i don't know if we don't give them a
 
03:09:56.950 --> 03:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
number they may not they may not do it
 
03:09:59.670 --> 03:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
unless they can wait for a week what are
 
03:10:02.070 --> 03:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
you saying representative ames that
 
03:10:04.870 --> 03:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
as we do a more detailed dive on
 
03:10:06.950 --> 03:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
wednesday and thursday
 
03:10:08.229 --> 03:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
that we keep this in the back of our
 
03:10:10.630 --> 03:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
minds as we're going through this
 
03:10:13.269 --> 03:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
and you would feel more comfortable at
 
03:10:15.910 --> 03:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
the end of next week
 
03:10:19.349 --> 03:10:19.359 align:start position:0%
estimating uh the impact
 
03:10:26.150 --> 03:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
in your mind of a single sales factor
 
03:10:29.510 --> 03:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah i
 
03:10:34.150 --> 03:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh i i don't know what to say the uh um
 
03:10:36.229 --> 03:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
what we what the data that we have is
 
03:10:38.150 --> 03:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
the historical data that representative
 
03:10:39.590 --> 03:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
army has
 
03:10:43.510 --> 03:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
pointed to which has different numbers
 
03:10:47.190 --> 03:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
by year very substantial numbers in the
 
03:10:48.630 --> 03:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
most recent year
 
03:10:50.309 --> 03:10:50.319 align:start position:0%
that are above the number we're talking
 
03:10:50.319 --> 03:10:52.309 align:start position:0%
that are above the number we're talking
about

03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:10:55.590 --> 03:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
then we got market-based sourcing uh
 
03:10:57.670 --> 03:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
coming into the picture
 
03:11:01.110 --> 03:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
and uh confusing things
 
03:11:06.070 --> 03:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh it does add up for me
 
03:11:09.750 --> 03:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
so also based on my understanding of the
 
03:11:11.349 --> 03:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
role of manufacturing
 
03:11:14.469 --> 03:11:14.479 align:start position:0%
and sort of businesses that are likely
 
03:11:14.479 --> 03:11:15.510 align:start position:0%
and sort of businesses that are likely
to

03:11:15.510 --> 03:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:11:19.750 --> 03:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
pay less tax with single sales factor
 
03:11:21.990 --> 03:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
it all adds up to a negative how much of
 
03:11:23.349 --> 03:11:23.359 align:start position:0%
a negative
 
03:11:26.389 --> 03:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
i wish i knew um but uh
 
03:11:29.030 --> 03:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
if you're asking for a number why not
 
03:11:29.040 --> 03:11:30.550 align:start position:0%
if you're asking for a number why not
12.9

03:11:30.550 --> 03:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
12.9
 
03:11:33.750 --> 03:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh no i i don't know
 
03:11:36.469 --> 03:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's that arbitrary but uh
 
03:11:37.910 --> 03:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
12.9 or
 
03:11:42.309 --> 03:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
or 10 i'd say i'd round at 10
 
03:11:57.110 --> 03:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:58.710 --> 03:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
i think it is in the 30 million range
 
03:12:01.269 --> 03:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
but i mean we could put a lower
 
03:12:03.349 --> 03:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh give them a range of 10 to 20 or
 
03:12:06.389 --> 03:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:09.670 --> 03:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
i'm comfortable with that i think
 
03:12:13.510 --> 03:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to have a number
 
03:12:16.950 --> 03:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
that they can put into the surplus
 
03:12:16.960 --> 03:12:18.550 align:start position:0%
that they can put into the surplus
statement

03:12:18.550 --> 03:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
statement
 
03:12:21.349 --> 03:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
even though we don't know what it is
 
03:12:22.870 --> 03:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to
 
03:12:25.510 --> 03:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
give them a number just like we did for
 
03:12:27.429 --> 03:12:27.439 align:start position:0%
the revenue estimate
 
03:12:31.110 --> 03:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
chris did they talk about a number
 
03:12:34.550 --> 03:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
tall for this um i don't
 
03:12:36.309 --> 03:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
know what the discussions has been about
 
03:12:38.550 --> 03:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
this uh single sales factor in adding
 
03:12:39.510 --> 03:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
the bill in
 
03:12:41.670 --> 03:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
but reps on volume is correct in the
 
03:12:42.790 --> 03:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
sense that the the
 
03:12:45.510 --> 03:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee want a single number
 
03:12:46.790 --> 03:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
if you provided a range they would
 
03:12:48.389 --> 03:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
probably take the midpoint of the range
 
03:12:50.309 --> 03:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
to add to a surplus statement
 
03:12:51.750 --> 03:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
or they might take high point of the
 
03:12:57.510 --> 03:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:59.030 --> 03:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
if you want to control that to some
 
03:13:00.550 --> 03:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
extent you may want to provide a single
 
03:13:02.150 --> 03:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
number if you want to give them the
 
03:13:04.150 --> 03:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
ability to kind of choose between the
 
03:13:05.590 --> 03:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
range then you can
 
03:13:09.030 --> 03:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
provide um i think it's just an ongoing
 
03:13:10.550 --> 03:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
discussion right now and i think that
 
03:13:13.670 --> 03:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
i i was under the impression that some
 
03:13:15.910 --> 03:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
of the division chairs are waiting on
 
03:13:17.750 --> 03:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
this committee to make some decisions
 
03:13:19.510 --> 03:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
around what the impact might be if they
 
03:13:20.950 --> 03:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
added that bill
 
03:13:24.710 --> 03:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:28.070 --> 03:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
how about somebody else wants to
 
03:13:32.389 --> 03:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:33.910 --> 03:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know if they have their notes in
 
03:13:38.710 --> 03:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:47.349 --> 03:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:51.349 --> 03:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
well i've heard the 30 million
 
03:13:54.229 --> 03:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh figure and i've heard the 10 million
 
03:13:56.229 --> 03:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
dollar figure
 
03:13:59.349 --> 03:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
um and i'm just wondering if
 
03:14:01.510 --> 03:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
we could all agree on splitting the
 
03:14:03.030 --> 03:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
difference and making it
 
03:14:09.590 --> 03:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:12.870 --> 03:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
the dollars southwest yes that's what i
 
03:14:14.630 --> 03:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
was thinking as well
 
03:14:17.110 --> 03:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
again there are many many uh variables
 
03:14:18.389 --> 03:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
to consider but
 
03:14:20.389 --> 03:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
that seems like a reasonable compromise
 
03:14:26.309 --> 03:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:29.590 --> 03:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
um representing southwest uh
 
03:14:33.990 --> 03:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:37.269 --> 03:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
okay represents spillsberry thank you mr
 
03:14:37.279 --> 03:14:38.790 align:start position:0%
okay represents spillsberry thank you mr
chairman

03:14:38.790 --> 03:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:14:41.510 --> 03:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
i truly feel like i'm stabbing in the
 
03:14:43.030 --> 03:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
dark on this one
 
03:14:47.190 --> 03:14:47.200 align:start position:0%
um 10 million i feel comfortable with
 
03:14:50.469 --> 03:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
20 million i'd go along with but i'm
 
03:14:52.630 --> 03:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
the echo that keeps going on in my mind
 
03:14:54.790 --> 03:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
as we're having this discussion
 
03:14:57.830 --> 03:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
is those carry forwards and
 
03:15:01.510 --> 03:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh the idea that uh
 
03:15:04.309 --> 03:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
effectively people are going to be asked
 
03:15:04.319 --> 03:15:05.190 align:start position:0%
effectively people are going to be asked
to

03:15:05.190 --> 03:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:15:06.790 --> 03:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
chip those down whether it's a refund
 
03:15:08.550 --> 03:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
check check or whether it's lowering
 
03:15:09.830 --> 03:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
their estimates
 
03:15:12.550 --> 03:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
um so that's part of this discussion as
 
03:15:12.560 --> 03:15:16.950 align:start position:0%
um so that's part of this discussion as
well

03:15:16.950 --> 03:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:19.990 --> 03:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
03:15:22.630 --> 03:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
i just say that these are separate
 
03:15:22.640 --> 03:15:23.750 align:start position:0%
i just say that these are separate
discussions

03:15:23.750 --> 03:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
03:15:27.830 --> 03:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
that all add up to a number
 
03:15:30.389 --> 03:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
at the end the carry forward issue is
 
03:15:30.399 --> 03:15:31.429 align:start position:0%
at the end the carry forward issue is
gonna

03:15:31.429 --> 03:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
03:15:34.389 --> 03:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
also it's pr i i hope it's going to be
 
03:15:36.229 --> 03:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
at least amended
 
03:15:39.349 --> 03:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
but we really don't want to put it off
 
03:15:43.990 --> 03:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:45.349 --> 03:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
mom why don't we just go with the 20
 
03:15:47.269 --> 03:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
million and let you know others haven't
 
03:15:49.110 --> 03:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
weighed in i mean
 
03:15:52.550 --> 03:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh they all have to let's go with the 20
 
03:15:53.910 --> 03:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
million for now
 
03:16:00.710 --> 03:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:03.990 --> 03:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
and so that our our
 
03:16:08.630 --> 03:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:12.630 --> 03:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh what was it eight forty yeah
 
03:16:16.070 --> 03:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
well it would be sixty
 
03:16:21.030 --> 03:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
point one what would it be
 
03:16:23.750 --> 03:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
instead of eight forty it was eight
 
03:16:23.760 --> 03:16:24.550 align:start position:0%
instead of eight forty it was eight
forty

03:16:24.550 --> 03:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
forty
 
03:16:27.910 --> 03:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
point one from the razor bike by twenty
 
03:16:31.110 --> 03:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
so it'd be eight 860. yeah
 
03:16:34.790 --> 03:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:37.750 --> 03:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
but the economic situation has been
 
03:16:39.830 --> 03:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
changing also so
 
03:16:43.590 --> 03:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
the base may change next week
 
03:16:46.870 --> 03:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
the uh there isn't anything that i
 
03:16:50.150 --> 03:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
see in economics that is
 
03:16:55.750 --> 03:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:01.429 --> 03:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:06.150 --> 03:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
so uh what did you say what did you say
 
03:17:09.750 --> 03:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i don't i haven't
 
03:17:13.269 --> 03:17:13.279 align:start position:0%
heard of anything at this point in time
 
03:17:18.950 --> 03:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:22.229 --> 03:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you which means we may want to
 
03:17:23.830 --> 03:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
raise our base
 
03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
yes and we'll talk about that
 
03:17:31.750 --> 03:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:35.110 --> 03:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
so do your homework
 
03:17:38.309 --> 03:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:40.550 --> 03:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
and by by your homework that means just
 
03:17:42.870 --> 03:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
don't look at the numbers
 
03:17:46.469 --> 03:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
look at the papers look at magazines
 
03:17:46.479 --> 03:17:48.550 align:start position:0%
look at the papers look at magazines
look

03:17:48.550 --> 03:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
look
 
03:17:51.349 --> 03:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
listen to the economist listen to the
 
03:17:54.950 --> 03:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
personal people listen
 
03:17:59.670 --> 03:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:02.710 --> 03:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
all right anything else we
 
03:18:06.950 --> 03:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:09.510 --> 03:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
then we'll call it quick for the day and
 
03:18:12.469 --> 03:18:12.479 align:start position:0%

representative vo's but it's back
 
03:21:33.670 --> 03:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
several emails it was yesterday i did a
 
03:21:35.830 --> 03:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
copy of it out i do have it i have it
 
03:21:38.870 --> 03:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
in the email the 222 because we do have
 
03:21:40.190 --> 03:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
it if that's
 
03:21:40.200 --> 03:21:43.750 align:start position:0%
it if that's
0-2-2-2-h

03:21:43.750 --> 03:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:46.309 --> 03:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
so when you say that there there is
 
03:21:47.510 --> 03:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
nothing negative
 
03:21:50.710 --> 03:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
on the economic front
 
03:21:54.469 --> 03:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
we have the country split exactly in two
 
03:21:58.070 --> 03:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
on the opinion of on the what
 
03:22:01.510 --> 03:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
we have a bill that has
 
03:22:04.790 --> 03:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
half half the congress
 
03:22:07.590 --> 03:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
not supporting it and half supporting it
 
03:22:07.600 --> 03:22:07.910 align:start position:0%
not supporting it and half supporting it
i

03:22:07.910 --> 03:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:22:10.309 --> 03:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
i think there's i think there's a lot to
 
03:22:10.319 --> 03:22:11.670 align:start position:0%
i think there's i think there's a lot to
discuss

03:22:11.670 --> 03:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
03:22:14.550 --> 03:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's a very different economic package
 
03:22:15.750 --> 03:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
that we're facing
 
03:22:18.870 --> 03:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
and we will be discussing that stimulus
 
03:22:22.630 --> 03:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
i think it's uh and and this
 
03:22:27.030 --> 03:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:30.070 --> 03:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of states are split well
 
03:22:32.790 --> 03:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
but i only have to think about new
 
03:22:32.800 --> 03:22:33.429 align:start position:0%
but i only have to think about new
hampshire

03:22:33.429 --> 03:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:22:36.790 --> 03:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
i was the economic output
 
03:22:40.229 --> 03:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
what's happening more the unemployment's
 
03:22:41.670 --> 03:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
coming down
 
03:22:44.790 --> 03:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
the jobs number drops going up
 
03:22:48.229 --> 03:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
the more businesses are
 
03:22:51.429 --> 03:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
opening people
 
03:22:55.590 --> 03:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
spending money the personal income is
 
03:23:01.110 --> 03:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:04.150 --> 03:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
and a number of other indicators are in
 
03:23:05.269 --> 03:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
the positive
 
03:23:07.110 --> 03:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
direction doesn't mean they're going to
 
03:23:08.710 --> 03:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
stay there
 
03:23:11.750 --> 03:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
but they're positive right now
 
03:23:14.389 --> 03:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
and finally the vaccination systems are
 
03:23:16.150 --> 03:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
working better
 
03:23:18.630 --> 03:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
my second shot today when the
 
03:23:18.640 --> 03:23:20.630 align:start position:0%
my second shot today when the
vaccination

03:23:20.630 --> 03:23:20.640 align:start position:0%

in addition to what's coming so
 
03:23:36.710 --> 03:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
that the more of those shots there are
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
one timer
 
03:23:41.910 --> 03:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
