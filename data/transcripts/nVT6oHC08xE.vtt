nice to see you all Senator David Waters

District 4 to introduce Senate bill to
 
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
239 and as you see from the summary of
 
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
the bill uh here that it does a variety
 
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
of things related to um uh harm
 
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
reduction services and treatments for
 
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
substance uh misuse and I'll go through
 
00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
the bill in just a moment but I I bring
 
00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
the bill before you really as the
 
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
resultable out of work
 
00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
um by members of the of this committee
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
and uh the house and the Senate and many
 
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
others and
 
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
um I want to note particularly the harm
 
00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
reduction study committee that we had
 
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
last summer and uh last fall
 
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
representative Healy representative
 
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
former representative woods and
 
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards were all parts of
 
00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 align:start position:0%
of that and I had the copies of that
 
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 align:start position:0%
study sent too because the bill really
 
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
arises from all the issues that we
 
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
looked at in that study but of course
 
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
the bill and our a whole response to
 
00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 align:start position:0%
substance misuse as a result of
 
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
partnership over many years trying to
 
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 align:start position:0%
address these um issues I I do want to
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
point out particularly governor sununu
 
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
you know with the wisdom of establishing
 
00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
a doorways program and getting a grant
 
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
there which is a huge step forward for
 
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
the State the commission on Alcohol and
 
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs Patrick Tufts I'm on that
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
commission as the several legislators
 
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
are New Hampshire providers Association
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire harm reduction Coalition
 
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
and you know recovery organizations uh
 
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
you know thanks to the Manchester chief
 
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
of police mayor Craig and you know the
 
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
chiefs of police in general who have
 
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
have worked on these issues and really
 
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
out there in our communities on the
 
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
front lines the EMTs and and others um
 
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
you know I think in the legislature I
 
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
think back former representative Hannon
 
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
who pioneered needle exchange programs
 
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
along with Senator gray and you know
 
00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
Senator Senator Bradley and you know
 
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 align:start position:0%
members of this this Committee in the
 
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
house and um so I I just want to
 
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that that there's been so
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
much um good effort in the state and
 
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
that's the New Hampshire way to try to
 
00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 align:start position:0%
see what we can do about substance uh
 
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
misused disorder the opioid uh crisis
 
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
so um it the bill does a variety of
 
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
things and I want to start with what it
 
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
does in the first few pages related to
 
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission Alcohol and
 
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs what you see here
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
essentially embeds the language of harm
 
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
reduction throughout the statute for the
 
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
Governor's Commission because the
 
00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 align:start position:0%
Strategic plan which the commission has
 
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 align:start position:0%
developed over the last couple of years
 
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
creates a new area uh one of its task
 
00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
force groups in the area of harm
 
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
reduction so working with Patrick tops
 
00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.259 align:start position:0%
the numbers and other members of the
 
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 align:start position:0%
commission these kind of revisions
 
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the newly developed aspects
 
00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
of the mission of the governor's
 
00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
commission you'll see also on page one
 
00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
line 19 that it seemed to make a whole
 
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
lot of sense to add the president of New
 
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of chiefs of
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
police or designee to the commission
 
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
they're they're very glad to be included
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
here because they are doing so much work
 
00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:01.979 align:start position:0%
and you know their leadership on a lot
 
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
of the issues related to substance uh
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
misuse and they'll be a good new voice
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
on the on the on the committee so this
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
is what gets us through the first couple
 
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
of pages you'll just see the languages
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
um is dropped uh in in there
 
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.950 align:start position:0%
um is dropped uh in in there
um

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
and then I would like us to if we could
 
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.969 align:start position:0%
and then I would like us to if we could
please

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:22.979 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:24.050 align:start position:0%
please
um

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
turn to uh page three and another
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
important new connections it's made here
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
relating to the opioid abatement
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
advisory commission this was set up you
 
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
know rather quickly when we received the
 
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
settlement funding on the opioid suit
 
00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
and um that at the time it did not
 
00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
include a formal process of liaison with
 
00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:52.139 align:start position:0%
the chair of the governor's commission
 
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
and Alcohol and Other Drugs
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
so this is the language that the folks
 
00:07:58.129 --> 00:07:58.139 align:start position:0%
on that commission thought would make
 
00:07:58.139 --> 00:07:59.210 align:start position:0%
on that commission thought would make
sense

00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
um so you'll see here
 
00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
um the new sub paragraph upon
 
00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
consultation with the governor's
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
provide funding for syringe service
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
programs which is something that is
 
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
authorized under the opioid abatement
 
00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
settlement so the consultation uh will
 
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
be there and this is the same language
 
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
as it was put in Senate Bill 32 which
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
was sponsored you know recommended by
 
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
the commission on abatement so that this
 
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
kind of ties those up together together
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
well then starting on the bottom of um
 
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
on page three section 10. it seemed to
 
00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
make sense to put the doorways program
 
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
in statute as I said you know command
 
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
governor sununo and his leadership
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
establishing 11 doorways programs around
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
the state they have evolved they are
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
receiving about 28 million dollars in
 
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
federal funding at this at this point
 
00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
um and uh I it you know it really I
 
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
think makes sense because of success of
 
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
that program
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
um that had become a part of Statute and
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
the permanent feature of the ways in
 
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
which we're trying to address substance
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
misuse please do note that we amended
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
the bill in the Senate to make sure that
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
it is specifying existing federal funds
 
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the physical note
 
00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:23.459 align:start position:0%
suggests that if we lost the federal
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
funds we'd have to find some State
 
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
support but I think the record of what
 
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
our delegation has been able to secure
 
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
for us in the commitment of Federal
 
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
grant funding I I think that that won't
 
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
happen but it's important to note that
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
there's not a physical note related to
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
this because we are not requiring State
 
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
expenditures on that program at this at
 
00:09:44.769 --> 00:09:44.779 align:start position:0%
this time
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
then on page four we get more into the
 
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
heart of harm reduction
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
activities that are underway and uh
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
first off it takes an another look at
 
00:09:59.810 --> 00:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
the syringe service programs the needle
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
exchange programs and we heard an awful
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
lot from the chiefs of police and
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
particularly for Manchester about and
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
other cities on the Seacoast and else
 
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
around the state that we need to
 
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
coordinate better of how the syringe
 
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
Services programs are being run I know
 
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
there was some legislation a house that
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
tried to get a you know at this issue as
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
well and I'm very pleased that this bill
 
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
now is good with the chiefs of police in
 
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
this version and that that's an
 
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
important step forward in that
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
partnership so what it does is it says
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
the certain service programs um should
 
00:10:37.009 --> 00:10:37.019 align:start position:0%
coordinate and collaborate
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
with other local agencies but including
 
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and that's that's an
 
00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:44.339 align:start position:0%
important way to avoid some of the
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
problems that have occurred in the
 
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
operation of the of those programs
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
without that that coordination
 
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
um and you'll see a little bit further
 
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
down on Ice 12 13 the same consultant
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
and form
 
00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
Municipal law enforcement agencies
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
concerning syringe service program and
 
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
harm reduction activities it took a lot
 
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
of work to get to that language with the
 
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
chiefs of police but I and with the
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester and other municipalities but
 
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm pretty comfortable that we
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
reached a good good place and how to how
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
to um you know make sure that we are we
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
have everybody on board
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
um with that
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
then continuing the section um
 
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
13 uh you know I remember when we set up
 
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
the syringe service program I worked on
 
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
that legislation with Senator gray when
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
we finally got that that done and um
 
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
part of it that there was um to prohibit
 
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
the use of any state funds and that was
 
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
necessary at that time and there were
 
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
some federal guidelines about that as
 
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.430 align:start position:0%
some federal guidelines about that as
well

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:43.019 align:start position:0%
um but it seems that one thing you'll
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
hear if you talk with certain service
 
00:11:47.329 --> 00:11:47.339 align:start position:0%
providers programs around the state is
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
that they're really nervous about
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
sustaining their funding and the certain
 
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
service programs I mean my goodness do
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
we need them disease prevention somebody
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
gets HIV or hep C we're looking at 350
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
500 000 or if you have a heart valve
 
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.769 align:start position:0%
500 000 or if you have a heart valve
replacement

00:12:05.769 --> 00:12:05.779 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
the wound issues that we're now seeing
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
um was xylazine and uh and other things
 
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
that are you know you know wounds are
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily expensive to treat and
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
so a 10 cent needle and some clean swabs
 
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
um can prevent extraordinary
 
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
expenditures otherwise so that's why it
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
just it doesn't mandate it just opens
 
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
the door to it and you'll see in the
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
physical note that the um HH Department
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
of HHS says that under existing funding
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
we can handle this we can handle this um
 
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
but I think it's important to assure the
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
Syrian service program Community
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
um that as they provide their necessary
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
services that um we're not going to let
 
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
them fall apart if the grant you know if
 
00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
there's if they're grant funding and
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
also they're getting a lot of free
 
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
contribution from Hospitals now that are
 
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
are letting them put the um these the
 
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
syringes they exchange into the disposal
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
disposal expensive and that the hospital
 
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
is saying you can put them into our
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
disposal stream without charge and
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a huge help so we you
 
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
know we're kind of working so hard to
 
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
get this successful and I think this is
 
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
important there
 
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.870 align:start position:0%
important there
um

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
and then um on section 14 uh we get into
 
00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:21.139 align:start position:0%
the paraphernalia
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
issue and I I know that um you know this
 
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
has been the subject and I I do want to
 
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank representative Muse for his
 
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.449 align:start position:0%
thank representative Muse for his
leadership

00:13:29.449 --> 00:13:29.459 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
um and other members of the house for
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
their hard work on in this area as well
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
all the harm reduction areas you know
 
00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:37.019 align:start position:0%
representative Muse and the bills that
 
00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
they have come uh into the house trying
 
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
to get at the this this issue of um
 
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
these things and so the way that
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
um this bill does it is to focus on the
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
people who are providing the Services
 
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.990 align:start position:0%
people who are providing the Services
Under

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
Under
 
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
uh authorized under RSA 318 b43 you'll
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
see in lines 24 25 on page four that
 
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
those folks are authorized to run these
 
00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:04.139 align:start position:0%
programs by HHS
 
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
that notwithstanding the language on
 
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.769 align:start position:0%
that notwithstanding the language on
paraphernalia

00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia
 
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
that they can have in possession these
 
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.110 align:start position:0%
that they can have in possession these
items

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
items
 
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
so I think it's really important to say
 
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
to the folks who are operating the
 
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
programs that you're not going to be
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
arrested because you have certain
 
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.670 align:start position:0%
arrested because you have certain
supplies

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
supplies
 
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
that you are going to be Distributing at
 
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
your harm reduction program and so
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
that's why that's key there in lines 24
 
00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:38.459 align:start position:0%
to 26.
 
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:40.740 align:start position:0%
um then a bunch of definitions so what
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
do we mean and you'll see drug checking
 
00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:46.139 align:start position:0%
drug checking equipment
 
00:14:46.139 --> 00:14:48.110 align:start position:0%
drug checking equipment
um

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm continuing on the page
 
00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
five supplies the syringes preparation
 
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
containers and so forth eligible
 
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
activities mean that they can get these
 
00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.069 align:start position:0%
activities mean that they can get these
materials

00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
um do the training as needed on the drug
 
00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.389 align:start position:0%
um do the training as needed on the drug
checking

00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
checking
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
um technical assistance about about them
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
and then providing them
 
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.449 align:start position:0%
and then providing them
um

00:15:11.449 --> 00:15:11.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
so I just want to pause on that because
 
00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:15.899 align:start position:0%
this is important because I know that
 
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
you've had bills about this uh this is
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
one that seems that the syringe service
 
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
providers law enforcement are
 
00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:26.339 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the way this one is
 
00:15:26.339 --> 00:15:27.710 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the way this one is
done

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:15:29.689 --> 00:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
um the last part of this bill uh
 
00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:31.250 align:start position:0%
um the last part of this bill uh
addresses

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
um medically assisted
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
treatment and as you may know in this
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
area that it's been somewhat difficult
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we have medical providers
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
who have the necessary training so that
 
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
they can do the prescribing
 
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
for a medically assisted treatment
 
00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
it was that you had to get us something
 
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
called an X waiver which was an
 
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
additional waiver on your prescribing
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
license that lets you do this kind of
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
prescribing and depending on the extent
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
of training you could treat up to 25
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
patients or you could do more and it was
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
cumbersome and difficult
 
00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:12.779 align:start position:0%
for in some ways and really wasn't
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
serving the population that was needed
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
now between the time I first drafted
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
this bill when I was working on the X
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
waiver issue uh then our federal
 
00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
delegation got language inserted into
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
Federal legislation which got rid of the
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
X waiver hooray so what the bill said
 
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
okay let's then go at the issue of
 
00:16:35.689 --> 00:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
making sure that people when they get
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
re-licensed get some training and so
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
it's a very light touch it could be
 
00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
online training but when you go inferior
 
00:16:45.889 --> 00:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
licensing and it lists here the the What
 
00:16:47.329 --> 00:16:47.339 align:start position:0%
professions we're covering with that
 
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
that you get the training and um I
 
00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:52.259 align:start position:0%
decided to go this this way because I I
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
talked to
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
um providers you know and doctors in the
 
00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:56.459 align:start position:0%
field and they say you know if you're
 
00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
coming through a medical school now
 
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
and relatively recent graduate you've
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
got this kind of training
 
00:17:04.929 --> 00:17:04.939 align:start position:0%
um about Prime
 
00:17:09.169 --> 00:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
reduction and about prescribing but you
 
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
know that's that depends on the medical
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
school and a few years ago it just was
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
napping at all so um this said you know
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
and I think it's also a light touch in
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't say the first time you
 
00:17:21.169 --> 00:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
get a license it's when you go into your
 
00:17:23.449 --> 00:17:23.459 align:start position:0%
first renewal that that's the point you
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
can demonstrate with all the other
 
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
training you have to do to maintain your
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
license that you can demonstrate that
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
you you've done some education in this
 
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.289 align:start position:0%
you you've done some education in this
area

00:17:30.289 --> 00:17:30.299 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair and members of the committee
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your Indulgence for my long
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill but you know
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of little pieces in here and
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
um I want to just walk through it and
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions you may
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
have thank you Senator representative
 
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.950 align:start position:0%
have thank you Senator representative
Weber

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the walk through
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
um I just wondered when we talk about
 
00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:03.020 align:start position:0%
the medical licensing and re-licensing
 
00:18:06.409 --> 00:18:06.419 align:start position:0%
uh you've got Physicians and surgeons
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
and you have Physicians assistants
 
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
um is there a reason why we don't
 
00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:18.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.049 --> 00:18:21.059 align:start position:0%
yeah it may have been an oversight on my
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
my part but I I thought that I had it
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
was inclusive of the folks who were
 
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.750 align:start position:0%
was inclusive of the folks who were
doing

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
um medically assisted treatment and were
 
00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:30.299 align:start position:0%
allowed to do so but if I've missed
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
somebody I don't know
 
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll check I will check as well if
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
I miss somebody that is in an error but
 
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
I think I I think I identified the ones
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
who actually now are authorized to do it
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
but I maybe maybe we'll hear from
 
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
someone behind me
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question yeah
 
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
chairman um thanks for taking my
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
question I asked two separate questions
 
00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
can I do that sure
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
so the the first one's a response to
 
00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
that one I I assume you're already aware
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
that it's in medical rules that were
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
required every
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
um CME cycle to do three hours of uh
 
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
training in opioid prescribing or harm
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
reduction that's already exists were you
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
aware of that
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm not don't know if I saw that
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
so if this needs to be revised just to
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
specify towards that rulemaking because
 
00:19:24.049 --> 00:19:24.059 align:start position:0%
it may not be in statute I mean I wanted
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
to put in statute that's what I wanted
 
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
to do I mean rule making but in statute
 
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
is what I wanted to do so that brings me
 
00:19:32.029 --> 00:19:32.039 align:start position:0%
to my second question
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
um this is my night job my my day job is
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
that I advocate for the rights of people
 
00:19:39.289 --> 00:19:39.299 align:start position:0%
and pain
 
00:19:39.299 --> 00:19:39.890 align:start position:0%
and pain
um

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
um I've been doing this for 35 years I
 
00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:45.299 align:start position:0%
wrote the state opioid prescribing rules
 
00:19:45.299 --> 00:19:46.190 align:start position:0%
wrote the state opioid prescribing rules
um

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
um I just my big thing is barriers to
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
health care and harm reduction is a big
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
issue for us our concern is that every
 
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
time somebody comes up with a bill like
 
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.950 align:start position:0%
time somebody comes up with a bill like
this

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
that my people get neglected and in the
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
end they get harmed I just got back from
 
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.390 align:start position:0%
end they get harmed I just got back from
Dallas

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
Dallas
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
um speaking with a group of about a
 
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
hundred patients who are very angry
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
um what I think would help legislation
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
like this is that we have to realize
 
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
that there are people that actually
 
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
benefit from opioids and that um about
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
16 million at least benefit from
 
00:20:24.529 --> 00:20:24.539 align:start position:0%
long-term opioid therapy including
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
people at end of life
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
and they always get left out of these
 
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
committees and I would suggest that um
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'm curious what your thoughts are that
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
we put people that are actually affected
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
by pain on these committees so that they
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
can advise them about harm reduction and
 
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
how the bills are actually could be
 
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
better designed so they don't harm them
 
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your um your questions
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
you know I think the intent here uh is
 
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
to I mean I know we have things in rules
 
00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:00.539 align:start position:0%
but I've been on I was on gel car for
 
00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:03.299 align:start position:0%
many years and I know that there was a
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
desire throughout gel car's proceedings
 
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
that if something in rules is in rules
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
we ought to have legislative
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
authorization for that and so that is
 
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
part of why
 
00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419 align:start position:0%
the this is specifying in legislation if
 
00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
the committee has some wisdom about how
 
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
to change that or whether it's necessary
 
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
you know uh you know if you have some
 
00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
consultation with folks who are working
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
on this then then fine
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
um on your earlier point
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
I can't speak for the Governor's
 
00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:36.419 align:start position:0%
Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs I
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
think it would be useful to talk with
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
Patrick Tufts if you have some thoughts
 
00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:42.179 align:start position:0%
in that area I will say having worked on
 
00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
the Strategic plan and being on the
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
commission and being on the task force
 
00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:48.299 align:start position:0%
that's related to this area
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
that the idea of the task force is that
 
00:21:54.649 --> 00:21:54.659 align:start position:0%
it talks with everybody and so that you
 
00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
know it's a pretty big commission
 
00:21:59.570 --> 00:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of people in various
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
communities are represented there
 
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
um and there's nothing that prevents the
 
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.029 align:start position:0%
um and there's nothing that prevents the
commission

00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
um from talking with the folks that
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
you're including even if they're not
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
officially on the commission but I I
 
00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:12.419 align:start position:0%
think that's a conversation to have with
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
the with the chair Patrick Tufts just as
 
00:22:18.169 --> 00:22:18.179 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up sure I I'm actually
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
the vice chair of the opiate abatement
 
00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
commission I bring this up at every
 
00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:24.059 align:start position:0%
meeting so excuse me I was referring to
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
the commission on alcohol we interact
 
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
with each other so I mean I'm on a
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
commission alcohol on other drugs I mean
 
00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
the opioid abatement commission is its
 
00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
own thing and I respect that what I was
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
referencing to was the commission
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drugs and that I mean
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
you know the other commission if your
 
00:22:42.649 --> 00:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
commission wants to do something in
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
context of this bill great but I was I
 
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
thought you were referring to the other
 
00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
one yeah thank you thank you thank you
 
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question first thing is I just
 
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that I was really pleased
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
to hear you talk about the um harm
 
00:23:06.409 --> 00:23:06.419 align:start position:0%
reduction I I've been taking care of too
 
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
many people with long-term wound
 
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
infections and
 
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
um a recent heart valve replacement in a
 
00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
29 year old and obviously that's a huge
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
cost and and a huge use of resources my
 
00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
question is really nitpicky though which
 
00:23:21.659 --> 00:23:23.029 align:start position:0%
question is really nitpicky though which
is

00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
you're asking that the audit by the New
 
00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:28.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medical Society of those
 
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
continuing medical education
 
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.270 align:start position:0%
continuing medical education
um

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
credits be done annually where our
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
licensing is every two years and I'm
 
00:23:41.049 --> 00:23:41.059 align:start position:0%
just thinking of how small an agency
 
00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
the medical society is and whether that
 
00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
ought to be every two years as we're
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
renewing yeah thanks for your question
 
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
um that is existing statute yeah so what
 
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
I what this bill does is just the Bold
 
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
there on lines 31 to 33 and I I so I
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
gotta plead my ignorance about the audit
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
issue because of this existing statute
 
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
if it's already in statute I'm sure they
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
would have complained about it already
 
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
thank you representative King
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you senator
 
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
for taking questions
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
a harm reduction I I couldn't find a
 
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
specific definition of exactly what harm
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
reduction is within this bill so I
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
apologize if I miss that but I'm also
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
curious is the harm reduction only
 
00:24:30.289 --> 00:24:30.299 align:start position:0%
intended for the drug misuser or is it
 
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059 align:start position:0%
for society as a whole my concern is is
 
00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
that this legislation is going to or is
 
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
patterned after what we're seeing around
 
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
a lot of the country where we've we've
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
been bending over backwards for
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote harm reduction for the
 
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
drug misuser but society as a whole is
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
just being ravaged by needles being
 
00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:51.419 align:start position:0%
littered in the streets people
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
defecating in the streets homelessness
 
00:24:57.529 --> 00:24:57.539 align:start position:0%
violence I mean and my concern is is is
 
00:25:00.409 --> 00:25:00.419 align:start position:0%
is do you see any chance that we're
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
going to turn in to a lot of these other
 
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
blue cities
 
00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:06.539 align:start position:0%
as a result of something like this thank
 
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
you yeah thanks for your question and I
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that because I think
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
what you're getting at is the kind of
 
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
interlinking of the issues that people
 
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
are are facing because certainly
 
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
substance misuse mental health disorders
 
00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.610 align:start position:0%
substance misuse mental health disorders
homelessness

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
go down the line and you talk to the
 
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
people you know law enforcement or
 
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
service providers in the streets and
 
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you how
 
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
there are many factors here
 
00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:34.669 align:start position:0%
there are many factors here
um

00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know in terms of this
 
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
bill it does kind of necessarily look at
 
00:25:42.649 --> 00:25:42.659 align:start position:0%
harm reduction through the lens of
 
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
substance misuse disorders now I've
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
talked a bit about you know opioids and
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
so on but the governor's commission
 
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drugs is really quite
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
comprehensive in what it looks at that
 
00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
you look at the doorways program people
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
can present there with many many
 
00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:03.539 align:start position:0%
different kinds of substances
 
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
um that that are there so the harm
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
reduction does necessarily in this
 
00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:12.059 align:start position:0%
context focus on the substance misuse
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
to your larger Point
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
harm reduction wants to keep people
 
00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.570 align:start position:0%
harm reduction wants to keep people
alive

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
alive
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
and you know some in the recovery
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
Community myself for 40 40 some years
 
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.510 align:start position:0%
Community myself for 40 40 some years
now

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
um you know it's really stuck with me
 
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
that you can't go into recovery if
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
you're dead
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
and so that
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
um the notion here is that these harm
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
reduction services
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
provide an access point
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
and if you go out and you go with one of
 
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
the Vans or go to the parking lot in
 
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
Nashville where you know wherever these
 
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:49.140 align:start position:0%
services and you and you watch observe
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
how it's being done that there's a kind
 
00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
of a check in there Wellness you know
 
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
the naloxone is given maybe some needles
 
00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
exchanges so maybe some other supplies
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
but that becomes a relationship
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
and people who engage in harm reduction
 
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.789 align:start position:0%
and people who engage in harm reduction
programs

00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
um have a vastly higher percentage of
 
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
then enter in recovery
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
um and being more successful in their
 
00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:15.419 align:start position:0%
recovery program and that starts to help
 
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
address the larger issues is that you're
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I will also point
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
to Governor sununu's leadership you know
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to address this but look at
 
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
all the work that is being done in
 
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.710 align:start position:0%
all the work that is being done in
housing

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
look at all the work that's being done
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
on Mental Health
 
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
you know these are these are complex
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
problems I I think we can do some good
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:39.059 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you senator for
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill to us I have two
 
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
questions around the funding aspects if
 
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
I can ask those my first would be if you
 
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799 align:start position:0%
know what the level if it's a percentage
 
00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:51.059 align:start position:0%
or a dollar figure that the federal
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
funding is currently for the doorways
 
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.830 align:start position:0%
funding is currently for the doorways
program

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
and if you don't know the physical note
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
says 20 28 million and is that is that
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
done at a percentage basis do you know
 
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
is it paying for the entire program
 
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
right now yes it's a grant funded
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
program thank you and then my second
 
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
question is on the syringe funding
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
um would prioritizing that for use of
 
00:28:15.409 --> 00:28:15.419 align:start position:0%
the opioid abatement fund be something
 
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
that was logical in your mind as opposed
 
00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
to just going straight to General funds
 
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
well that's the question see we got a
 
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
settlement that puts I don't have the
 
00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:27.299 align:start position:0%
the millions in my head but we've got a
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
specialist of settlement and it may not
 
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
be the last settlement we get from the
 
00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
industry for the lawsuits that we
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
brought forward
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
and um so the decision was made wisely
 
00:28:39.649 --> 00:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
let's put that in the fund a separate
 
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
fund and establish the
 
00:28:45.769 --> 00:28:45.779 align:start position:0%
committee that would um decide how best
 
00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:48.179 align:start position:0%
to spend those funds you know smart move
 
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
from the governor you know I mean that
 
00:28:51.049 --> 00:28:51.059 align:start position:0%
was the way to do it uh and from the
 
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
legislature too I mean you know good
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
good move
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
um to do it that way and um so the
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
priorities in terms of how that funding
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
goes out are set by the opioid abatement
 
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
Commission so um that's really I think a
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
very appropriate way
 
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
um that's that it could determine
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
working with the governor's Commission
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
on Alcohol and Other Drugs to figure out
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
if proposals come forward to the the
 
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
abatement commission how much money
 
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
they're going to put out and that can be
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
coordinated with the amount of money
 
00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
that is being put out through the
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
governor's commission potentially from
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
federal grants so
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
um this is not this is not um require a
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
certain amount it it this is enabling
 
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
just one follow-up sure and then um
 
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:41.940 align:start position:0%
reading between the lines it seems that
 
00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a partner Bill to Senate
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 32 which is the one about that so
 
00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
looking at the two of them together
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
would make sense yes thanks for the
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
third um Senate Bill 32
 
00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:54.539 align:start position:0%
um deals with several issues related to
 
00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:57.419 align:start position:0%
the um opioid abatement commission and
 
00:29:59.210 --> 00:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
um so I wanted to make sure because I
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
had a little different language and so I
 
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
worked with the sponsors of that bill to
 
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
make sure that in both both bills that
 
00:30:06.529 --> 00:30:06.539 align:start position:0%
we've got the same the same language and
 
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
that's that there that that this
 
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:10.460 align:start position:0%
language suggested by the opio Boyd
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
abatement commission to do it in this
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
bill to have it like that
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Shapiro
 
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
for the longest time it seems to me that
 
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.029 align:start position:0%
for the longest time it seems to me that
um

00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
you know our state strategy for dealing
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
with the terrible problems with
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
substance misuse and overdose deaths
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
um you know the strategy follows the
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
money so a grant comes we create a
 
00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:46.700 align:start position:0%
program the grant goes away the program
 
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
closes and I'm wondering if
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
um putting the doorways into statute and
 
00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.029 align:start position:0%
um putting the doorways into statute and
um

00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:58.970 --> 00:30:58.980 align:start position:0%
taking the saying the money that goes
 
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:01.140 align:start position:0%
towards harm reduction can come from the
 
00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:04.140 align:start position:0%
general fund is this move us any closer
 
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:06.620 align:start position:0%
to having a new hampshire-based
 
00:31:09.049 --> 00:31:09.059 align:start position:0%
long-term strategy to deal with this
 
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:11.220 align:start position:0%
problem I I don't know that it's been
 
00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
tremendously successful but it's um
 
00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
certainly we've moved forward with
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
having a
 
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
a long-term strategy based on what the
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
state needs so is this
 
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
um concretize that thanks for your
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
question and you know uh when when any
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
kind of emerging problem or crisis
 
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
develops there are a lot of things that
 
00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
are tried some work some don't and I
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
think that for the federal government as
 
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
well that you know maybe the grant
 
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
funding didn't address certain things
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
and I think that
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
that they've gotten better at this you
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
know they understand Federal money has
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
to come into these programs but what's
 
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
going to work and what doesn't
 
00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's why I argue that
 
00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
the demonstrated success of the doorways
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
so the New Hampshire's tried a lot of
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
things right we have we have a lot of
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
you know law enforcement Grant and
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
Hammer we've done that we've uh worked
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
with the feds on certain things we've
 
00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:06.539 align:start position:0%
we've tried with the medical society
 
00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
providers prescribed with the recovery
 
00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
organizations you know recovery housing
 
00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
we're trying a lot of things but I think
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
what's emerging through the Strategic
 
00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
plan of the governor's commission
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
alcohol the drugs and I and it's not
 
00:32:18.529 --> 00:32:18.539 align:start position:0%
very long I really recommend it because
 
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
it took a couple year process to say
 
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
where are we
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
um what's succeeding and strategically
 
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
how do we move forward and reorganize
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
the commission with that Focus now
 
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
including harm reduction so
 
00:32:33.409 --> 00:32:33.419 align:start position:0%
um I I think that that that's why I put
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
it in the bill on the doorways that you
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
know the consensus was from HHS and
 
00:32:39.649 --> 00:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
other folks that
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
um this is going to be a long-term
 
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
long-term feature and one in one version
 
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
or another because it can evolve we're
 
00:32:48.649 --> 00:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
going to need something like the
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
doorways but we need a point of access
 
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
for programs that people can go to and
 
00:32:57.409 --> 00:32:57.419 align:start position:0%
get the help they need and be sent to
 
00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
the places that can give it and that
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
that to me is an important model here
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
and there and the doorways program is
 
00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
really willing to you know expand to
 
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
other places and expand its Mission as
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
needed and as appropriately funded
 
00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.750 align:start position:0%
needed and as appropriately funded
because

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
we need them we need them thank you
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
representative Naval thank you Mr
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks again for taking yet
 
00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:21.059 align:start position:0%
another my question
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I was struck with
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
as I was reading through the bill was
 
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.220 align:start position:0%
that um the word misuse was abuse was
 
00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:33.059 align:start position:0%
xed out misuse was put in and
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
um it's a relatively another sensitive
 
00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:37.019 align:start position:0%
subject to me but I'm just curious why
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
that was done
 
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um that really throughout was
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
at the advice of HHS because this is the
 
00:33:44.279 --> 00:33:45.529 align:start position:0%
at the advice of HHS because this is the
term

00:33:45.529 --> 00:33:45.539 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
um that is now generally in use among
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
providers and uh and others so that
 
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
um you know I remember when it used to
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
be the other the other term
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
um several years ago and now this this
 
00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:00.059 align:start position:0%
is what the field says is the
 
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
appropriate language to use so that's
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
why HHS recommended we do that I'm a
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm making faces they both terms
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
have value and they're not the same
 
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
thing that's why I brought it up so here
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
um I I hear you representative McLean
 
00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
um harm reduction following on
 
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
representative King is a is a very broad
 
00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:25.909 align:start position:0%
representative King is a is a very broad
term

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
um and so as a newer member of the
 
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
committee I kind of struggle as to you
 
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
know where it begins and where it ends
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
it has some implied definitions in the
 
00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
bill itself so I'm just trying to get a
 
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
feel from you where do you kind of
 
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
Envision if the uh if the doorways
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
program is now empowered to to go down
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
this path as well they're going to be
 
00:34:49.609 --> 00:34:49.619 align:start position:0%
getting into housing assistance I mean
 
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
so which could be considered potentially
 
00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:54.899 align:start position:0%
harm reduction so what do you maybe see
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
as the scope of it or do you not have a
 
00:34:58.609 --> 00:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
full feel for that yet and waiting for
 
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
the commission to kind of do some of its
 
00:35:00.359 --> 00:35:01.849 align:start position:0%
the commission to kind of do some of its
work

00:35:01.849 --> 00:35:01.859 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
um thanks for the question and you know
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
if the you're so right you know my lens
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
is like this that I've been so involved
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
with it and I you know back it up and
 
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
saying do we need and do we need in
 
00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
statute or harm reduction definition I'm
 
00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
not sure we do but there are definitions
 
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
out there and certainly that was what
 
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
was motivating the
 
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
um Governor's commission and changing
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
its mission to include it was a kind of
 
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
a consensus over what it meant in this
 
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
context now as you know representative
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
King's good question about harm
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
reduction can mean you know every
 
00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
everything every ill that besets our
 
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
society we've got to reduce the harm of
 
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
it right and I get that you know but I
 
00:35:40.609 --> 00:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
think that in this context we're talking
 
00:35:43.089 --> 00:35:43.099 align:start position:0%
about an acceptance kinds of practices
 
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
that reduce the harm that is involved
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
with substance misuse so that's what
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
we're focusing on and these practices
 
00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
new ones evolve but there are many many
 
00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
practice harm reduction can be
 
00:35:59.450 --> 00:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
needle exchange
 
00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
it can be wound kits it can be safe sex
 
00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.250 align:start position:0%
it can be wound kits it can be safe sex
kits

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
kits
 
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
um it can be clean water
 
00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
it can be bandages it can be naloxone
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
but see the context there is for how do
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
you reduce harm for people substance
 
00:36:17.089 --> 00:36:17.099 align:start position:0%
misuse disorders so that's I don't know
 
00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
if I'm answering your question but
 
00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the surrounding logic
 
00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
so is the intention then that the
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
commission which kind of fleshed out a
 
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
little bit as it goes forward bring that
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
back to the budget task force and then
 
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
that would get some kind of further
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
review later on I'm just kind of trying
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
to understand what the trajectory is on
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
this thing yes thanks for the question
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sorry I didn't provide it to
 
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
you but I could you know you can go
 
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
online to hhs's website and go to the
 
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
governor's commission and you can you
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
can take a look at the Strategic plan I
 
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
said it's not terrifically long so it's
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's very readable and you will find a
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
lot of your coincidence your questions
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
answered there in terms of funding what
 
00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission is responsible
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
for in statute is that the federal
 
00:37:05.329 --> 00:37:05.339 align:start position:0%
funding we get and other state funding
 
00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
um you know is kind of brought is is
 
00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.770 align:start position:0%
um you know is kind of brought is is
distributed

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
through a grant making process that is
 
00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
supervised by the governor's commission
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
so the governor's commission you know
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
makes the recommend it gets the grant
 
00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
applications it makes it you know from
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of programs all around the
 
00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:26.579 align:start position:0%
state and it apportions you know it
 
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
apportions out the funding that it has
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
so harm reduction would be in that
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
context of applications for use and and
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
the available funding
 
00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
and so forth now the other issues about
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
housing and these things I mean there
 
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
are other folks working on that um but
 
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
that's not appropriate for the
 
00:37:46.849 --> 00:37:46.859 align:start position:0%
Governor's commission alcohol that other
 
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
drugs so so not within that okay thank
 
00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.109 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative

elberger
 
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman
 
00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.230 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman
um

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for this excellent
 
00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:00.530 align:start position:0%
thank you for this excellent
presentation

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
um and just one quick comment having
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
started my work in addiction treatment
 
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
as working in an alcoholism treatment
 
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
agency where other drugs were not
 
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
connected I really appreciate that
 
00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
instead of saying alcohol and drugs the
 
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
language here is Alcohol and Other Drugs
 
00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
because they are all in fact drugs
 
00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:24.589 align:start position:0%
because they are all in fact drugs
um

00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:26.940 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
in ways and means we spent a lot of time
 
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
working on the cannabis bill
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering how
 
00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
some of the provisions in here about no
 
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:39.140 align:start position:0%
harm and and treating harm
 
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
preventing harm connect with any of the
 
00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
provisions that are coming up in that
 
00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.310 align:start position:0%
provisions that are coming up in that
bill

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your question the doorways
 
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.790 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your question the doorways
program

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:52.619 align:start position:0%
um does address folks who have issues
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
with uh with cannabis and really
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
comprehensively any anything that
 
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
somebody presents with you know we're
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of a lot of increased meth
 
00:39:02.089 --> 00:39:02.099 align:start position:0%
around right now
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
um so whatever you present
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
with at the doorways program you'll you
 
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
will be referred to appropriate services
 
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
so that's that's another reason that
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
whatever emerges it's it's ready to take
 
00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
it on and that's what harm reduction is
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
about whatever emerges how can we help
 
00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
reduce harm
 
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman you're
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
welcome and I'll say Mr chairman that a
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
lot of the kind of inner workings of how
 
00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
HHS and these programs work we're good
 
00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
folks back here that um actually know
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
what they're talking about someone from
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
HHS has signed up to testify so yeah
 
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:38.220 align:start position:0%
other questions for the senator
 
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you I'm
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
sorry yes representative kofault
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question so
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
um this my question has to do with the
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
section on page four that is uh stricken
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
out use of general fund shall be
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
prohibited unless otherwise appropriated
 
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:00.839 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
so so I know
 
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
um representative Leon asked a question
 
00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:08.099 align:start position:0%
about General funds before is this
 
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
primarily because opioid abatement trust
 
00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:12.829 align:start position:0%
primarily because opioid abatement trust
funds

00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
are you know fit that description and in
 
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
order to spend those we need to
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh we need to strike this this language
 
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
from statute or is this a general
 
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
intention that you know we're going to
 
00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:28.490 align:start position:0%
intention that you know we're going to
expand

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
expand
 
00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:32.579 align:start position:0%
the the program and and sort of not let
 
00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
Federal funding or opioid abatement
 
00:40:38.089 --> 00:40:38.099 align:start position:0%
funding uh or the the existence of that
 
00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
funding or the the uh non-existence that
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
funding prevent us from continuing with
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
these programs I'm just thanks for your
 
00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
question and um the opioid abatement
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
funding is in a fund it's not general
 
00:40:53.089 --> 00:40:53.099 align:start position:0%
fund right so that that is not what is
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
directly here
 
00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
uh just a little bit of history when you
 
00:40:59.690 --> 00:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
know it took us two two try two times
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
two tries over two sessions to get the
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
needle exchange program and we didn't do
 
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
that until I don't know it was 2016-17
 
00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.130 align:start position:0%
that until I don't know it was 2016-17
whereas

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
whereas
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of other states have done it
 
00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
starting in the 80s and 90s and I hate
 
00:41:14.089 --> 00:41:14.099 align:start position:0%
to think of the cases of HIV and Hep C
 
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
during that period but there we were
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
to get that bill passed
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of resistance at the
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
time for all the reasons you might
 
00:41:25.849 --> 00:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
imagine it was important to have that
 
00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
provision in there
 
00:41:29.569 --> 00:41:29.579 align:start position:0%
I think that people have seen over the
 
00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:31.619 align:start position:0%
last few years the necessity of these
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
programs and while so this bill is not
 
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
appropriate anything from General funds
 
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
it just say that a future legislature
 
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
would not have its hands tied if it
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
seems appropriate
 
00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:47.300 align:start position:0%
to include some State funding to support
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
syringe exchange programs so that's
 
00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:54.260 align:start position:0%
that's precisely why just striking that
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
means that future legislatures in the
 
00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
budget can have the option if they think
 
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you so
 
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
much and I'm available there are more
 
00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
questions that's okay great thank you
 
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
just before you go on it might be useful
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
for all of us to note that this is an
 
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
early Bill and it will go to I assume to
 
00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
finance afterwards my understanding is
 
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
I also signed up to speak is genio
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
Higgins from the Department of Health
 
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.569 --> 00:42:38.579 align:start position:0%
for three minutes and that's that's
 
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
usually the rule for people testifying
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
hello there thank you so much chair and
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
Jenny O Higgins I'm a policy Analyst at
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
the department for Health and Human
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
Services and Behavioral Health and your
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison for these topics so
 
00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make sure to speak
 
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
today to this bill and the department is
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
in full support of the bill it makes
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
many appropriate language changes based
 
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
on best practice in the field as well as
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
adding the potential of additional
 
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
services and codifying existing services
 
00:43:16.849 --> 00:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
in the state that are critical to
 
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
reducing substance use disorder and any
 
00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
Community harms Associated and what I
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
did want to comment on today is that
 
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
there is an attached fiscal note
 
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
worksheet which was submitted back in
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
February and since that time our
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
concerns have been corrected in the
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
amendment and working with Senator
 
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
Waters and so we you know have not had
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to update that fiscal
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
note worksheet but the piece here that
 
00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
really was concerning initially was
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
around making codifying the doorway
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
system that was is all stood up through
 
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
Federal funding and as you've heard
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
already that state opioid response Grant
 
00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
is on a two-year cycle and the state
 
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
does have to reapply every two years so
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
we're currently in the third iteration
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
of our state opioid response Grant and
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
it does end September 30th 2024 and the
 
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
state will reapply again we're currently
 
00:44:12.829 --> 00:44:12.839 align:start position:0%
receiving that 28 million dollars per
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
year on those two-year cycles of which
 
00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
the doorway program is approximately 11
 
00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:20.220 align:start position:0%
million dollars additionally we have
 
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
five staff members that oversee that
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
state opioid response program and
 
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
continue to monitor those contracts and
 
00:44:28.849 --> 00:44:28.859 align:start position:0%
so our concerns had just been that
 
00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
financial burden without that funding
 
00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
the funding is based on a federal
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
formula which is really based on two
 
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
specific data points one is the state's
 
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
proportion of drug overdose deaths per
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
the CDC and the other is the state's
 
00:44:44.089 --> 00:44:44.099 align:start position:0%
proportion of people who meet a
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
diagnostic criteria for dependence who
 
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
report not having received treatment
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
which is from the national survey on
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
drug use and health and that those
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
formula funds can change in each
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
two-year cycle of the state opioid
 
00:44:59.809 --> 00:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
response Grant so our concern would be
 
00:45:02.569 --> 00:45:02.579 align:start position:0%
having less funding but needing to run
 
00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
the same program I think the way that
 
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
the language has changed both says that
 
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
with availability of appropriate funding
 
00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
we can run this program the other thing
 
00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:11.579 align:start position:0%
that it does is that we actually change
 
00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
just the very specific nature of how the
 
00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
doorway was defined to actually talk
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
more about substance use disorder access
 
00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
points which we will intend to to have
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know fully Behavioral Health crisis
 
00:45:26.089 --> 00:45:26.099 align:start position:0%
system through all of our work in our
 
00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
long-term planning that may or may not
 
00:45:30.349 --> 00:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
include those Federal funding formulas
 
00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:32.339 align:start position:0%
so to the point that was a question that
 
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
was asked earlier about sort of longer
 
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
term sustainable funding and how New
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will do this work this
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
language change gives us more
 
00:45:41.089 --> 00:45:41.099 align:start position:0%
flexibility to make sure that we
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
continue to integrate our substance use
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
disorder care within our mental health
 
00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
behavioral health system and Primary
 
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
Care in long-term term
 
00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm happy to take questions
 
00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
and any perfect timing yes any questions
 
00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
question I want to I hope if you're not
 
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
the right person let me know but I do
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
want to get back to that same question
 
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.609 align:start position:0%
want to get back to that same question
about

00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:07.619 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
abuse versus misuse
 
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.150 align:start position:0%
abuse versus misuse
um

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
to me it's an incredibly important
 
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
distinction and in the controlled Drug
 
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
Act it's actually abuse of defined
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
misuse is not defined harm reduction is
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
not defined
 
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious from hhs's point of
 
00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
view why it was important to make that
 
00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:28.490 align:start position:0%
view why it was important to make that
change

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for your question
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
so people who expect stigma are less
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
likely to access treatment and less
 
00:46:37.609 --> 00:46:37.619 align:start position:0%
likely to to be retained in treatment
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
and go on to get well right so our words
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
and language have a significant impact
 
00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
on how people see themselves and how
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
people see themselves has a significant
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
impact on whether or not they access
 
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
care and so are we we've done a lot to
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
best practice language changes in order
 
00:46:56.809 --> 00:46:56.819 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're doing stigma
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
reduction so the term abuse was found to
 
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
have a really high association with
 
00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
negative judgment or punishment and so
 
00:47:08.569 --> 00:47:08.579 align:start position:0%
the term misuse or use that is it allows
 
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
for an even more broad thinking than
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
addiction or a substance use disorder so
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
substance use disorders are on a
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
spectrum and opening that more broadly
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
allows us to also fund prevention and
 
00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
early intervention and to treat people
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
long before they may even experience a
 
00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:26.220 align:start position:0%
full substance use disorder but that
 
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
so this is my concern
 
00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:37.730 align:start position:0%
so this is my concern
um

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
in my my knowledge base is primarily
 
00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.230 align:start position:0%
in my my knowledge base is primarily
opioids

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
opioids
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to limit it to that but
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
we know that there's 11 million cases of
 
00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
misuse per year
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
um 70 of those is defined by the CDC are
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
actually functionally self-medication
 
00:47:56.569 --> 00:47:56.579 align:start position:0%
people are misusing because they're not
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
getting access to treatment for pain or
 
00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.890 align:start position:0%
getting access to treatment for pain or
whatever

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
um that's where I'm struggling with the
 
00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
distinction and I get the stigma thing
 
00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.530 align:start position:0%
distinction and I get the stigma thing
totally

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
totally
 
00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:07.430 align:start position:0%
totally
um

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
um but I think we're dealing with two
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
separate issues and I just it may open
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
up greater doors for us but it may also
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
restrict doors for us too
 
00:48:20.089 --> 00:48:20.099 align:start position:0%
um opening I I probably should explain
 
00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
that right no do you have a question
 
00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
yeah I want to under I
 
00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm still trying to understand you
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
know how this is gonna help when when it
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
seems to me that
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
that 70 of people is going to be harmed
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
by this kind of Distinction
 
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
I think that's something where I'd be
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
happy to work with you offline to either
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
Define use misuse and abuse and how we
 
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
think it would make the best sense to
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
get the work done all right that's fair
 
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
we've had this discussion a lot
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you Mr
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking questions
 
00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
um I've heard the term a few times
 
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
already today needle exchange program
 
00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
um but I'm looking through this bill and
 
00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
what I'm seeing is not syringe Exchange
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
program I'm seeing the term syringe
 
00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
service program so my question is in
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
order to get a new clean needle is it
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
required to exchange an old needle
 
00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
simplest answer there is no so the
 
00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
access to a new syringe allows for a
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
reduction in um you know all kinds of
 
00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
medical challenges including infectious
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
disease endocarditis and so that that
 
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
access is not restricted based on
 
00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
whether or not you turn in
 
00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
um previously use syringes which you may
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
not have in your possession
 
00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
um the change the difference in all of
 
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
the language pieces there with what
 
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
you've said with needle exchange syringe
 
00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
Services programs all of that and harm
 
00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
reduction is that it's broader than than
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
an exchange of needles alone right
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
because there is also naloxone there is
 
00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
also referrals to treatment services
 
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
there's making a connection with people
 
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
and making sure they have many of the
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
other supplies or things that they would
 
00:50:11.809 --> 00:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
need to keep them health healthy and
 
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
safe and reduce that harm
 
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
what requirement
 
00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:23.099 align:start position:0%
um or requisite
 
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
is required for an individual to
 
00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:30.839 align:start position:0%
get a new needle so for example it's
 
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
illegal in this state to possess
 
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
you know a hyper needle if you're just
 
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
an average person but if you show up to
 
00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
these service centers and you ask for a
 
00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.089 align:start position:0%
these service centers and you ask for a
needle

00:50:44.089 --> 00:50:44.099 align:start position:0%
needle
 
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
and we give it to you
 
00:50:49.609 --> 00:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
under the assumption that you misuse
 
00:50:49.619 --> 00:50:51.230 align:start position:0%
under the assumption that you misuse
drugs

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
what requirement
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
is there on the person to prove that
 
00:50:59.089 --> 00:50:59.099 align:start position:0%
they actually do have a drug misuse
 
00:50:59.099 --> 00:51:02.510 align:start position:0%
they actually do have a drug misuse
problem

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
access to to Health Care broadly
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
essentially so there's not a requirement
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
to to be able to receive Services it's
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
very low barrier in order to help reduce
 
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
Public Health harm okay thank you very
 
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
much thank you other questions
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
as representative Merchant
 
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thanks for taking
 
00:51:23.809 --> 00:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
I want to commend everyone trying to
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
expand harm reduction in dealing with
 
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
misuse and abuse and things of that
 
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:32.510 align:start position:0%
misuse and abuse and things of that
nature

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
nature
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
but one of the key words in here that I
 
00:51:37.849 --> 00:51:37.859 align:start position:0%
refer to throughout this document is the
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
word prevention
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
so what are we doing to prevent people
 
00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
on getting on opiates in the first place
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
I mean how is this commission helping to
 
00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:47.890 align:start position:0%
I mean how is this commission helping to
guide

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:47.900 align:start position:0%
guide
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
non-opioid therapy drug use if you will
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
to get him into other things that would
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
be helpful to treating pain because
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
the old saying goes an ounce of
 
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
prevention is worth a pound of cure but
 
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
what are we doing on the prevention side
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
to help the patient first and foremost
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
not even getting on the trail for opiate
 
00:52:11.809 --> 00:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
used to begin with
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
can I just clarify or the with the
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
governor's commission plan is it
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
specifically sure so the governor's
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
commission plan does have significant
 
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
amount of prevention I think prevention
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
could always use more funding I will say
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
that especially because there's not also
 
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for things like
 
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
insurance reimbursement on the
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
prevention side right so it does take
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
additional dollars to put into
 
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
prevention programming to do it well
 
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
however New Hampshire has done you know
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
um a number of different
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
programs including our Student
 
00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
Assistance professionals sap program
 
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
educational programming and youth you
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
know coalitions drug-free Community
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
grants all kinds of prevention
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
programming and that and there is a
 
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
specific report that comes out from the
 
00:52:58.609 --> 00:52:58.619 align:start position:0%
governor's commission as well that I'd
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
be happy to provide you with to actually
 
00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:01.859 align:start position:0%
walk through some of the prevention
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
efforts and not to say that they're ever
 
00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:08.150 align:start position:0%
efforts and not to say that they're ever
um enough

00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
thank you and also thank you for the
 
00:53:13.859 --> 00:53:14.990 align:start position:0%
thank you and also thank you for the
report

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
you hit I think the nail on the head it
 
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
comes down to is the patient doesn't
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
have the insurance coverage for non
 
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
pharmacological therapy
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm just trying to find out from the
 
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
governor's point of view of this
 
00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:28.790 align:start position:0%
governor's point of view of this
Commission

00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
what kind of focus they're trying to do
 
00:53:33.049 --> 00:53:33.059 align:start position:0%
with the insurance industry to help
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
patients or maybe fund a pilot program
 
00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:39.500 align:start position:0%
so patients can seek if you will
 
00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
non-opiate therapy to help them with
 
00:53:43.609 --> 00:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
their pain that's what I'm kind of where
 
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to go to
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
because right now the funding's not
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
there the insurance companies many times
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
don't either reimburse for it or put a
 
00:53:53.809 --> 00:53:53.819 align:start position:0%
lot of barriers up for the patients to
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
get that kind of pain control
 
00:53:59.210 --> 00:53:59.220 align:start position:0%
so just trying to find out from the
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
governor's point of view essentially
 
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
here what is being done in that Arena
 
00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
it actually goes a little bit further
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
than what I was thinking of when you
 
00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
originally asked about prevention
 
00:54:10.609 --> 00:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
programming which is which I was
 
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
speaking to is much further Upstream
 
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
around education for young people and
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing I think you're
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
talking very specifically about pain
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
management Alternatives yeah so that's
 
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
something that I can bring back and ask
 
00:54:23.089 --> 00:54:23.099 align:start position:0%
a question about to try to answer thank
 
00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
you sure
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you again Mr
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking another
 
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
one of my questions I think you may have
 
00:54:32.809 --> 00:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
been here
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
um when I asked the senator the question
 
00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
and that is my concern is that this
 
00:54:39.049 --> 00:54:39.059 align:start position:0%
legislation is patterned after what
 
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.220 align:start position:0%
we're seeing around the country and the
 
00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:43.740 align:start position:0%
results are going to be
 
00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
um just massive amounts of homelessness
 
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
and violence and needles littering the
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
streets and feces and just a nightmare I
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to see that it used to be in
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
this country that if you prove to be a
 
00:54:59.210 --> 00:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
harm to yourself or harm to others you
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
went into the padded room until you got
 
00:55:05.569 --> 00:55:05.579 align:start position:0%
better and what I see here potentially
 
00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
is just really kind of the Cheapskates
 
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
version of harm reduction it's like oh
 
00:55:11.569 --> 00:55:11.579 align:start position:0%
we don't want to pay for them to go to
 
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
the padded room so we'll just give them
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
the needles and the drugs they need and
 
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
just kind of get them out of our hair Mr
 
00:55:17.569 --> 00:55:17.579 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm going to object to the
 
00:55:17.579 --> 00:55:19.069 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm going to object to the
language

00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
my apologies does this seem like a uh a
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
very Financial uh inexpensive way to
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
solve the problem whereas the more
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
expensive solution would be time to go
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
into the padded room thank you
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
chair yeah that is true offensive
 
00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
I hope you will rule that it shouldn't
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
be used anymore representative King I I
 
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
please be more considerate
 
00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what was inconsiderate
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
representative Weber um
 
00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the correct term is
 
00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:08.420 align:start position:0%
psychiatric facility okay
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
on those terms that's it's kind of slang
 
00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
use okay very outdated and uh kind of
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
offensive in today's
 
00:56:25.609 --> 00:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
so you may proceed with the okay thank
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
you so the um the way that we're
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
offering care has actually significantly
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
changed based on so much more detailed
 
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
research so what we know is that
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
community-based care
 
00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
has better outcomes and that you know
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
residential facilities are are needed
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
for a very small amount of the
 
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
population and so I what you're
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
describing would be a residential
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
facility I don't think that we're moving
 
00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:58.010 align:start position:0%
facility I don't think that we're moving
care

00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
um based on a financial decision I think
 
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
we're truly moving care into a way where
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
we're meeting people where they're at to
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
keep them healthy and well and we're
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
doing that you know based on significant
 
00:57:12.049 --> 00:57:12.059 align:start position:0%
research and to provide better care with
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
better outcomes because people do well
 
00:57:17.329 --> 00:57:17.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
okay other questions representative
 
00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.010 align:start position:0%
okay other questions representative
cofult

00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
cofult
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:29.700 align:start position:0%
um I personally know someone who is a
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
recovering addict who has benefited
 
00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:35.220 align:start position:0%
greatly from a methadone program
 
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
and so I'm curious to know if if that is
 
00:57:41.809 --> 00:57:41.819 align:start position:0%
when we talk about when we use the
 
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
phrase harm reduction my understanding
 
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
is that harm reduction is we've talked a
 
00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
lot about syringe service programs
 
00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:50.700 align:start position:0%
um can you talk about some other things
 
00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:52.140 align:start position:0%
that are incorporated into that
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
definition and specifically is something
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
like a methadone program does that fall
 
00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
under the the the category of harm
 
00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:01.970 align:start position:0%
under the the the category of harm
reduction

00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
sure so harm reduction can be used very
 
00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
broadly the way that I think about harm
 
00:58:09.049 --> 00:58:09.059 align:start position:0%
reduction is that I have my kids wear a
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
helmet when they ride their bike I have
 
00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
them you know ride in a car seat I wear
 
00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
my seatbelt these are all harm reduction
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
strategies right so it can be very broad
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
it can be all of the different types of
 
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
things that we do to reduce harm it's
 
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
bug spray it's sunscreen you know and so
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
anything that we can do to keep
 
00:58:25.849 --> 00:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
ourselves and our community members
 
00:58:28.609 --> 00:58:28.619 align:start position:0%
healthier and reduce fatality ultimately
 
00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
when we get into this level of the kind
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
of harm reduction that's being done it's
 
00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:34.140 align:start position:0%
about reducing the spread of infectious
 
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
disease and it's about keeping people
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
alive so that they have the opportunity
 
00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
to go on to get well FDA approved
 
00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
medications for substance use disorder I
 
00:58:44.809 --> 00:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
would consider treatment
 
00:58:47.329 --> 00:58:47.339 align:start position:0%
um they they obviously can also reduce
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
harm so I think it just depends on how
 
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
you define harm reduction but they would
 
00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
be they would be considered treatment
 
00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
and they would be reimbursable as well
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
under insurance so that
 
00:58:58.609 --> 00:58:58.619 align:start position:0%
is how I would personally answer that
 
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
question and I think people Define harm
 
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
reduction differently
 
00:59:04.849 --> 00:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking this
 
00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:07.970 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking this
question

00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:07.980 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
um in regards to the question of whether
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
people should be treated or be given the
 
00:59:14.809 --> 00:59:14.819 align:start position:0%
opportunity to reduce harm in the
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
community versus
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
um going to a residential program or a
 
00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.630 align:start position:0%
um going to a residential program or a
hospital

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
Etc would you agree that we've already
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
had a lot of experience with separating
 
00:59:28.849 --> 00:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
people in an attempt to help them with
 
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
their problems by sending people to jail
 
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
and sending people to prison and that
 
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.089 --> 00:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
that and during into the criminal
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
justice system does come with inherent
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
additional risks and so it can be very
 
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
traumatizing for folks and does you know
 
00:59:49.609 --> 00:59:49.619 align:start position:0%
we now have done our Criminal Justice
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
System especially in New Hampshire I
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
think can be very proud of the work that
 
00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
they're doing to provide adequate care
 
00:59:58.130 --> 00:59:58.140 align:start position:0%
um and is very much invested in the work
 
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
that we're doing with the governor's
 
01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:02.220 align:start position:0%
commission as well I do though believe
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
that there are just multiple Pathways to
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
Recovery just like with every other
 
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:08.460 align:start position:0%
chronic illness and that we need to
 
01:00:11.329 --> 01:00:11.339 align:start position:0%
trust that and respect that people have
 
01:00:14.329 --> 01:00:14.339 align:start position:0%
a say in their care as well and so in
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice system it's you
 
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
know punitive because you've broken the
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
law when we're talking about treatment
 
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
and harm reduction and we're talking
 
01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
about access to health care and so it
 
01:00:25.849 --> 01:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
may be that a medication isn't right for
 
01:00:28.849 --> 01:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
you it may be that a 12-step program is
 
01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
right for you it may be that it's a
 
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:32.460 align:start position:0%
medication and cognitive behavioral
 
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:34.140 align:start position:0%
therapy it may be that residential
 
01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:36.059 align:start position:0%
treatment I mean we're looking at are
 
01:00:38.089 --> 01:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
there the the efficacy and the outcome
 
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
comes of multiple different Pathways to
 
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
Recovery and in New Hampshire we're
 
01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
yes representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
and taking my question
 
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
um you're talking about the different
 
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
therapies and we had a discussion on a
 
01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:56.700 align:start position:0%
previous Bill and did you email me the
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the evidence on which ones
 
01:01:02.569 --> 01:01:02.579 align:start position:0%
I haven't no I have not said that but I
 
01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:05.940 align:start position:0%
do have an overview of the treatments um
 
01:01:07.849 --> 01:01:07.859 align:start position:0%
available for opioid use disorder and
 
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
their efficacy okay that would be great
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
um a follow-up follow-up um thank you it
 
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
has to do with this too
 
01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:15.650 align:start position:0%
has to do with this too
um

01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
so when we're it sounds like we need a
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
more narrow definition of harm reduction
 
01:01:21.359 --> 01:01:22.190 align:start position:0%
more narrow definition of harm reduction
um

01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm hearing that it includes
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
treatment and then I'm hearing it
 
01:01:28.849 --> 01:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
doesn't include treatment so
 
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
um would you say that it's separate from
 
01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
treatment and that the harm reduction is
 
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
solely based on
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
a current user
 
01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:40.339 align:start position:0%
treatment aside
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
who just we're trying to prevent the STD
 
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
trans I mean the
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
bloodborne pathogen transmission and and
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
infections and things like that
 
01:01:53.089 --> 01:01:53.099 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the critical
 
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
um piece around including harm reduction
 
01:01:57.530 --> 01:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
in all of this work and writing it into
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission and the
 
01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
funding and this bill is that it isn't
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursable in the way that clinical
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
treatment services are so as we
 
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier around prevention the
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
need for additional funding and
 
01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
diversified funding sources to make sure
 
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
that our harm reduction programs can
 
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
continue to operate is not dissimilar
 
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
from those in the prevention area right
 
01:02:19.849 --> 01:02:19.859 align:start position:0%
and then when we're talking about
 
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
treatment we're talking about clinical
 
01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
treatment and therefore there is also
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates in addition to any
 
01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
Federal grant funds and things like that
 
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the reasons that it's
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
so important that we make sure we
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
specifically call this out is for the
 
01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:34.740 align:start position:0%
reason of being able to keep them
 
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions okay thank you
 
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:52.740 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Lauren
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
McGinley from New Hampshire harm
 
01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.390 align:start position:0%
McGinley from New Hampshire harm
reduction

01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
if you've asked for five minutes I'd
 
01:03:00.289 --> 01:03:00.299 align:start position:0%
appreciate if you keep it to three
 
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
I will keep it to three thank you
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you committee for having me today
 
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
my name is Lauren McGinley I'm the
 
01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
harm reduction Coalition we operate
 
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
three of the state's harm reduction
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
programs I'll clarify very quickly I'm
 
01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
attempting to change my language from
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
syringe service programs to harm
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
reduction programs only because syringe
 
01:03:25.849 --> 01:03:25.859 align:start position:0%
service programs utilize the word
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
syringe and we are looking to provide
 
01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
harm reduction relative to all types of
 
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
substance use including alcohol smoking
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
snorting things like that we want to
 
01:03:38.089 --> 01:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
make those Services as accessible to
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
people who may not use syringes but
 
01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
still need the the support of a harm
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
reduction program in their life and so
 
01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
my language gets corrected to harm
 
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
reduction program instead of syringe
 
01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
service program
 
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
for the for this conversation I mean
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
them interchangeably one in the same
 
01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:56.930 align:start position:0%
them interchangeably one in the same
um

01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:59.210 --> 01:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
we operate three of the state's harm
 
01:04:02.329 --> 01:04:02.339 align:start position:0%
reduction programs we also support
 
01:04:05.809 --> 01:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
Advocate collaborate and help fund the
 
01:04:08.089 --> 01:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
other the seven other programs that
 
01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
operate in our state throughout we have
 
01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
good coverage I think we could do better
 
01:04:16.609 --> 01:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
and as we move into communities and help
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
communities identify and build their own
 
01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
harm reduction programs we work very
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
hard to include an advisory committee of
 
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
those community members representative
 
01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
of a whole Continuum of professionals
 
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
to help guide our work as we begin to
 
01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
offer services educate providers
 
01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
interact with treatment and mat
 
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.010 align:start position:0%
interact with treatment and mat
providers

01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
we look at the Continuum that currently
 
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
exists which is prevention treatment and
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
recovery and we hope to
 
01:04:51.359 --> 01:04:51.890 align:start position:0%
recovery and we hope to
um

01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:54.049 --> 01:04:54.059 align:start position:0%
integrate some harm reduction practices
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
into every section of that continuum
 
01:04:59.690 --> 01:04:59.700 align:start position:0%
I applaud and appreciate that within
 
01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
this bill it also gives us a seat at
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
that Continuum table so now it is harm
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
reduction prevention prevention harm
 
01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:11.700 align:start position:0%
reduction treatment and Recovery
 
01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:12.349 align:start position:0%
reduction treatment and Recovery
um

01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:14.569 --> 01:05:14.579 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters and the harm reduction
 
01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
study committee listened to all of us
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
when we said that one of the biggest
 
01:05:23.089 --> 01:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
issues that we have in continuing to do
 
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
this work is the funding streams that we
 
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
have coming into the state and the way
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
the state is unable to currently fund
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
these public health programs
 
01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
I'd like to provide a little bit of
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
clarification and I'm happy to answer
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
any questions too if people would like
 
01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
to revisit a question or need some
 
01:05:45.069 --> 01:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
additional information
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
syringe service programs in New
 
01:05:49.549 --> 01:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all operate as an exchange
 
01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
some choose to operate on a plus 10
 
01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
model which means if you come with zero
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
syringes to exchange and have me
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
properly dispose of I am able to give
 
01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
you 10 syringes and that is engagement
 
01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:05.700 align:start position:0%
the most critical piece of harm
 
01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
reduction programming is engagement with
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
people who are actively using substances
 
01:06:15.289 --> 01:06:15.299 align:start position:0%
so that 10 can then be returned the next
 
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity that they have for again
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
plus 10. you bring me 10 I'm able to
 
01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
give you 20.
 
01:06:24.529 --> 01:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
the better coverage that we get within
 
01:06:27.529 --> 01:06:27.539 align:start position:0%
the regions that we serve the the higher
 
01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
rate of exchange the higher disposal
 
01:06:33.529 --> 01:06:33.539 align:start position:0%
that we provide and the lower numbers
 
01:06:35.809 --> 01:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
people need to sustain until that next
 
01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
point of interaction
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
so I will give an example if a community
 
01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
has a syringe service program that
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
operate operates once a week those
 
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
numbers need to go up in the amount of
 
01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
syringes and safe materials like wound
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
care for that person to prevent
 
01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
infection prevent the transmission of
 
01:06:58.609 --> 01:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
HIV to prevent fatal overdose it's a
 
01:07:00.589 --> 01:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
good start wrapping up please sure
 
01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
um so as we decide to
 
01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:04.309 align:start position:0%
um so as we decide to
um

01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
spread out across the state we look to
 
01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
those communities to identify how we do
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
that and what fits best for their needs
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
people had great questions thank you
 
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
um I noticed when I asked Senator Waters
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
about whether aprns
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
ought or ought not to be included in
 
01:07:31.559 --> 01:07:33.289 align:start position:0%
ought or ought not to be included in
this

01:07:33.289 --> 01:07:33.299 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
you were moving your head and I didn't
 
01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
know whether you were saying they didn't
 
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
need to be included or they did need to
 
01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
be included so I wondered if you'd care
 
01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
to elaborate out loud sure thank you for
 
01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:48.049 align:start position:0%
your question
um

01:07:48.049 --> 01:07:48.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:51.289 --> 01:07:51.299 align:start position:0%
any prescriber any DEA prescriber is
 
01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:54.200 align:start position:0%
allowed to prescribe some form of mat
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
the largest restriction exists within
 
01:07:58.849 --> 01:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
methadone treatment which still in our
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
state needs to be administered within
 
01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
methadone clinics but yes buprenorphine
 
01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
Vivitrol Suboxone can be administered by
 
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
any DEA prescriber aprns are included in
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
that category so yes my suggestion would
 
01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
be to add them
 
01:08:16.849 --> 01:08:16.859 align:start position:0%
I think proposed language could be any
 
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
DEA provider DEA prescriber sorry
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up
 
01:08:27.239 --> 01:08:29.390 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up
um

01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me that the problem
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
of just using any DEA provider is that
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
we need to get it somewhere close to the
 
01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.729 align:start position:0%
we need to get it somewhere close to the
APRN

01:08:37.729 --> 01:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
APRN
 
01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
statutes so that they actually know it
 
01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
rather than having it hanging out
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
somewhere that they might not look I do
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
agree with that yes naming all of them
 
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
would be an ideal situation yeah
 
01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Nagel and
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
then representative Cushman thank you
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
for Mr chairman I think I actually have
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
a really boring question I assume your
 
01:08:59.450 --> 01:08:59.460 align:start position:0%
T-shirt has value
 
01:09:01.150 --> 01:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
um what does that say
 
01:09:04.249 --> 01:09:04.259 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
it says all bodies are good bodies thank
 
01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:08.450 align:start position:0%
it says all bodies are good bodies thank
you

01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:09:09.769 --> 01:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
but that was the question
 
01:09:12.169 --> 01:09:12.179 align:start position:0%
I thought she wore it for a reason and
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
we should know what it was oh no I'm
 
01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
sorry oh representative Cushman
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:09:21.169 --> 01:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
being here and taking my question
 
01:09:21.179 --> 01:09:23.269 align:start position:0%
being here and taking my question
um

01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:23.279 --> 01:09:24.829 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
sorry got distracted
 
01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.789 align:start position:0%
sorry got distracted
oh

01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
it is you probably know the answer
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
because I saw you shaking your head when
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's only illegal in the
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
state for a minor to possess a
 
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
hypodermic needle is that correct with
 
01:09:43.729 --> 01:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
some exceptions yes thank you for
 
01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
allowing me to provide clarification
 
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
um the state of New Hampshire does allow
 
01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
any person over the age of 18 to have a
 
01:09:51.769 --> 01:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
hypodermic needle
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
um I am able to walk into any pharmacy
 
01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
and purchase them I am able to order
 
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
them on Amazon it is legal for somebody
 
01:10:02.689 --> 01:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
for anybody to have a hypodermic needle
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:10:08.689 --> 01:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
uh follow up sure and um would you just
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
for me step through that explanation
 
01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
that you were giving
 
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
um toward the end of your testimony
 
01:10:17.209 --> 01:10:17.219 align:start position:0%
about increasing the resources that
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
you're making available
 
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
um can you just break that down again
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
for me sure you said you bring I'll give
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
you 10 you bring back 10 and then I'll
 
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
give you 20. yeah thank you for that
 
01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:30.229 align:start position:0%
give you 20. yeah thank you for that
opportunity

01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
um so yeah so our three programs operate
 
01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
on a plus 10 model so again somebody
 
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
brings me 10 I can if somebody brings me
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
zero and says I need help I'm reusing my
 
01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
needles I'm buying needles off
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
Craigslist for five dollars I don't have
 
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
access to clean and safe wound care I
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
can say here's 10. here's a wound care
 
01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
kit here's an overdose prevention kit or
 
01:10:57.169 --> 01:10:57.179 align:start position:0%
what some would recognize as an overdose
 
01:10:59.810 --> 01:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
response kit so naloxone fentanyl test
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
strips a breathing mask I can provide
 
01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
them with a whole kit of services to
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
prevent infection to prevent the
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
transmission of HIV and most importantly
 
01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
to prevent fatality
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
the more opportunities that communities
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
get to offer those Services The Wider
 
01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
net you cast
 
01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:21.890 align:start position:0%
net you cast
um

01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
anybody that uses drugs that is trying
 
01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
to seek out our help deserves to have a
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
window of time within their life to do
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
so and so when we have one time a week
 
01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
to operate it really limits the amount
 
01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
of quality care that we can offer
 
01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
someone and so we work with communities
 
01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
to expand access to harm reduction
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
Services throughout any kind of touch
 
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
point that they may have so that they
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
can have you know
 
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
we call it the Swiss cheese effect some
 
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
swiss cheese has big holes and people
 
01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
can fall through them so we try to
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
shorten those holes so that people don't
 
01:11:58.370 --> 01:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
fall through
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
one more follower
 
01:12:03.649 --> 01:12:03.659 align:start position:0%
um okay so backtracking to if they come
 
01:12:06.649 --> 01:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
in with zero needles and you can give
 
01:12:09.229 --> 01:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
them ten and then if they come in with
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
those 10 then you can give them 20 yes
 
01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
and then if they come back with 20 you
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
give them 30 then where does that stop
 
01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
um so it is budgetarily limited usually
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
by the program our programs stop at 150.
 
01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
um and I want to identify that no person
 
01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
utilizes 150 syringes in a week what we
 
01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
have identified there is a person that
 
01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
is serving multiple people who do not
 
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
feel safe or have the ability to access
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
harm reduction programming in their
 
01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
Community we have had feedback from a
 
01:12:45.169 --> 01:12:45.179 align:start position:0%
lot of people that have said a harm
 
01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
reduction program saved my life and I
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
never visited one once because I was too
 
01:12:52.729 --> 01:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
scared because of the stigma because I
 
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
was in danger
 
01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
so when people come and are able to
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
um just just it's called secondary
 
01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
distribution when they are able to
 
01:13:02.930 --> 01:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
acquire what they need and share with
 
01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
others what they need those numbers
 
01:13:07.729 --> 01:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
start to really support multiple layers
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
of infection prevention in a community
 
01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter weapon yeah are
 
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
you all set yeah I saw your hand up
 
01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:18.780 align:start position:0%
earlier any other questions uh no
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative McLean just just quickly
 
01:13:23.630 --> 01:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so I'm starting to
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
thanks to all this testimony mentally
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
understand the buckets of treatment
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
prevention and and harm reduction and
 
01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you had actually
 
01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
changed uh your name to New Hampshire
 
01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
harm reduction to basically say just
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
kind of clarifying this is what it is so
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
from respect of the definition is that
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
how the broader Community really sees
 
01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:51.780 align:start position:0%
harm reduction and um do you see if this
 
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
was if this bill was to become law that
 
01:13:57.890 --> 01:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the harm reduction activity
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
For Those portions of the bill would be
 
01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
around that and that's what it's talking
 
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
about is that am I reading that
 
01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:05.930 align:start position:0%
about is that am I reading that
correctly

01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes I I
 
01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
believe I agree with you this bill is
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
comprehensive enough that it does cover
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
our current activities within harm
 
01:14:17.689 --> 01:14:17.699 align:start position:0%
reduction and it also allows for
 
01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
expansion within the the regions that I
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
believe you touched on earlier today
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
um connection to services for homeless
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
individuals connection to medical care
 
01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
for people that don't have it connection
 
01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
to long-term recovery supports or legal
 
01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
assistance or financial assistance all
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
of those things sometimes fall under the
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
purview of a syringe service program or
 
01:14:44.209 --> 01:14:44.219 align:start position:0%
harm reduction program because we
 
01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
recognize a person as a whole person and
 
01:14:49.370 --> 01:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
accessing that treatment or recovery
 
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
option can only happen once basic needs
 
01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
are met so basic needs do fall into our
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
category often but this bill covers our
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
the Practical strategies associated with
 
01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
harm reduction provision
 
01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
say no other questions okay thank you
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
no one else has signed up to testify on
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 239 does anyone else wish to
 
01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:21.050 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 239 does anyone else wish to

able to provide us more information on
 
01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
the syringe program and on this
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
background so that we can have more
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
information ahead of next week okay
 
01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:36.420 align:start position:0%

New London I'm here today to introduce
 
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
to you Senate Bill 238 so this bill
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
would allow an essential practice in the
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
care and treatment of mental health
 
01:16:29.209 --> 01:16:29.219 align:start position:0%
patients established which was first
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
established under our national covid-19
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
public health emergency and we want to
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
have this remain here in place in New
 
01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:36.430 align:start position:0%
have this remain here in place in New
Hampshire

01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:16:39.169 --> 01:16:39.179 align:start position:0%
once the national order
 
01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
Public Health Emergency has fully
 
01:16:43.490 --> 01:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
rescinded in May so will the ability to
 
01:16:47.209 --> 01:16:47.219 align:start position:0%
use tele telemedicine Telehealth to
 
01:16:49.729 --> 01:16:49.739 align:start position:0%
continue to prescribe for mental health
 
01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
conditions so specifically here we're
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
talking about the ability of Physicians
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
and nurse practitioners to prescribe
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
again via Telehealth schedule 2 through
 
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
schedule 4 Controlled Substances only
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
for the treatment of mental health
 
01:17:05.450 --> 01:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
conditions this had previously been done
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
last year for substance use disorders I
 
01:17:10.729 --> 01:17:10.739 align:start position:0%
think one of the Silver Linings from the
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic is that we learned that there
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
was a much wider use and acceptance of
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
Telehealth and in particular in the area
 
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
of treatment of granite Staters who are
 
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
experiencing mental health conditions in
 
01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
the words of Dr Roger awesome and he is
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
the he represents or he's part of the
 
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
community health centers Coalition and
 
01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
he actually is the executive director
 
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
for West Central Behavioral Services
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
which has its home in Senate District
 
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
Five he is quoted he's quoted as saying
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
Telehealth has offered patients the
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
capacity to participate in Services they
 
01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
may not otherwise have been able to
 
01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
access this can include older adults
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
people with mobility issues those who
 
01:17:58.490 --> 01:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
are housebound due to family needs or
 
01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
those who lack reliable or cost
 
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
efficient means of regular
 
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
transportation for them Telehealth has
 
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:09.300 align:start position:0%
proven to be not just a convenience but
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
a welcome necessity
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
so as I stated in the first part of my
 
01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
introduction that we're up against a
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
deadline in May when the National Public
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
Health Emergency will be rolled back so
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
the ability for nurse practitioners and
 
01:18:28.729 --> 01:18:28.739 align:start position:0%
Physicians to continue to prescribe
 
01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
via Telehealth will will cease to exist
 
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
we believe that I believe that this is a
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
necessity and so does a majority of of
 
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
the Health Care community and the mental
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
health professionals who've come
 
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
together behind this Senate bill
 
01:18:47.209 --> 01:18:47.219 align:start position:0%
I want to make a few points as we move
 
01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:48.900 align:start position:0%
forward you know again we're talking
 
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
about removing a barrier
 
01:18:52.930 --> 01:18:52.940 align:start position:0%
um and how valuable Telehealth has been
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
concerns have been raised during the
 
01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
Senate process that there weren't
 
01:18:59.930 --> 01:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
patient provider relationships that were
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
in person and at the we have testimony
 
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
from Dr Mary Lou Tyner from the New
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Psychiatric association who's
 
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
also in the community behavioral health
 
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
Coalition that there is a requirement
 
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
for an in-person visit to start this
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
process so it's and you know during the
 
01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
pandemic if we can just separate off
 
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
that time it was unlikely that you were
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
doing in person now it is required that
 
01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
that kicks off or starts the
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
relationship in order for this
 
01:19:33.229 --> 01:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
prescribing to take place I also want to
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
point out that you are looking at an
 
01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
amended version that comes out of the
 
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
Senate the amended version clarifies the
 
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
language or clarifies consent for minors
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
so it's my contention that that always
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
existed but the Senate and I support
 
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
this wanted to
 
01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
make sure that it was you know
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
clear across the board that parental
 
01:19:57.970 --> 01:19:57.980 align:start position:0%
consent for minors to receive treatment
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
from for mental health conditions and
 
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
particularly prescribing was clarified
 
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
um in the statute and you'll also see
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
that there was language added that had
 
01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
to do with access to a Minor's medical
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
records so with that I'm asking for your
 
01:20:16.370 --> 01:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
um your timely consideration
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that we are facing an
 
01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
essential deadline here and we want to
 
01:20:23.209 --> 01:20:23.219 align:start position:0%
continue to offer this service to
 
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
patients who are to have granted
 
01:20:26.209 --> 01:20:26.219 align:start position:0%
standards who are experiencing mental
 
01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
health conditions and rely on this as a
 
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
way for access to treatment Access to
 
01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
Health Care access to prescriptions when
 
01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
necessary so I will close my comments
 
01:20:39.649 --> 01:20:39.659 align:start position:0%
there I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
you have I do have people behind me who
 
01:20:46.669 --> 01:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
uh maybe who I know can provide further
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
points of clarification
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
um so that's it thank you thank you
 
01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
questions for us yes representative
 
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
Cushman thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
you senator for being here and bringing
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
um can you just tell me again where
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
um it clarifies that the initial
 
01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
encounter has to be in person
 
01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
the initial counter it's not written in
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
this bill it already existed
 
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
so we didn't we did not pull the
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
language in here but it was clarified by
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
the Psychiatric association that they
 
01:21:17.209 --> 01:21:17.219 align:start position:0%
have to have that patient provide a
 
01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
relationship it exists in medicine as is
 
01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
it just was different during during
 
01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
coven that you couldn't prescribe to a
 
01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
patient unless you had a relationship
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
with them
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
another question just representative
 
01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.390 align:start position:0%
another question just representative

01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
Nagel
 
01:21:34.010 --> 01:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.330 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
question

01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
um I think I read through this bill
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
about a hundred times trying to
 
01:21:42.169 --> 01:21:42.179 align:start position:0%
solve my concerns
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
um and I thought I'd solved them but
 
01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
then you said something that changed my
 
01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
mind okay
 
01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:49.250 align:start position:0%
mind okay
um back

01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
um back
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
um I I know it it's the purpose is
 
01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
mental health but as we know these
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
medications have value well beyond the
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
mental health realm and what I'm
 
01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:00.260 align:start position:0%
concerned about is for me to do my job
 
01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
is be getting harder and harder because
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
I have patients that are 200 miles away
 
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
from me in Telehealth to prescribe an
 
01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
opioid is incredibly important I want to
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that this bill doesn't take
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
away my ability to treat somebody's pain
 
01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a mental health problem
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Dr Nagel so
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take away that ability in
 
01:22:23.290 --> 01:22:23.300 align:start position:0%
fact your committee has already
 
01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
considered House Bill 500 yes which is
 
01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
broader and is encompassing of all of
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
this so we had these two bills mine that
 
01:22:34.370 --> 01:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
was more tailored on the mental health
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
side as a follow-up to substance use
 
01:22:39.649 --> 01:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
disorder and then we have HB 500 so I
 
01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
hope that helps answer your question
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
it helps a lot thanks you're welcome Dr
 
01:22:46.970 --> 01:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
Diego representative Merchant
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and also thank you
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
Senator princess for taking the question
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
um speaking of House Bill 500 I believe
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
is heard by the Senate Health Human
 
01:22:58.189 --> 01:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
Services committee
 
01:23:00.890 --> 01:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
um any thoughts on where that's going at
 
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
this point in time what I'm trying to
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
get to it sounds like it could be some
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
redundancy between this bill and that
 
01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:06.470 align:start position:0%
redundancy between this bill and that
bill

01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:23:08.570 --> 01:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
but if House Bill 500 is moving through
 
01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
the Senate and you're absolutely right
 
01:23:13.490 --> 01:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
we're facing a deadline by May 11th in
 
01:23:16.010 --> 01:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
order for us to not impact if you will
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
current practice
 
01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
so what happened on House Bill 500
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative Merchant and
 
01:23:26.209 --> 01:23:26.219 align:start position:0%
good to see you this morning House Bill
 
01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
500 has been heard by the Senate it uh
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
we are actually well it has been heard
 
01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
by Senate HHS which I sit on we are not
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
meeting this week I know that it is
 
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
under consideration that we're talking
 
01:23:40.729 --> 01:23:40.739 align:start position:0%
about uh we're talking about some of the
 
01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
same amendments that we discussed here
 
01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:44.780 align:start position:0%
in terms of consent
 
01:23:47.450 --> 01:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
medical records all of the necessary
 
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
clarifications so here's the bottom line
 
01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
whether it's 238 or 500 and I think
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
honestly I mean this is my bill but 500
 
01:23:56.689 --> 01:23:56.699 align:start position:0%
is the better vehicle because it is
 
01:23:59.090 --> 01:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
broader and I think it does a bet it's
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
it serves the granite state better so
 
01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
these two will meet up and I think
 
01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
within the committee is well aware of
 
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
the timeline that we're facing
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have a a
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
question and a follow-up my question is
 
01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:20.090 align:start position:0%
question and a follow-up my question is
um

01:24:20.090 --> 01:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:23.570 --> 01:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
I thought or I assumed that this bill
 
01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:24.470 align:start position:0%
I thought or I assumed that this bill
um

01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
applied to people of all ages but then
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
it starts off with talking about
 
01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:32.450 align:start position:0%
it starts off with talking about
um

01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
minor children and parents so
 
01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
is it true that it applies to
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
um children as well as adults
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question it applies
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
to children as well as adults okay
 
01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
um I I don't see that this is a full
 
01:24:55.729 --> 01:24:55.739 align:start position:0%
solution in any way but could this be an
 
01:24:59.090 --> 01:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
incremental help in terms of the
 
01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
emergency room boarding situation where
 
01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
people could actually make contact with
 
01:25:07.010 --> 01:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
a with a provider by phone in an
 
01:25:08.689 --> 01:25:08.699 align:start position:0%
emergency rather than go in an emergency
 
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I don't think I
 
01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
can give a thoughtful answer I mean I
 
01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
worked in an emergency room that boarded
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
patients regularly and you know they
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
have to present themselves in order to
 
01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
be triaged and managed appropriately the
 
01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
telephonic uh replacement or
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
what do I say substitution for that
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not clear how that would work given
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
them tala given there's a few other
 
01:25:40.729 --> 01:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
considerations so thank you for the
 
01:25:42.290 --> 01:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
question I'd be happy to think about it
 
01:25:44.689 --> 01:25:44.699 align:start position:0%
and get and circle back to you thank you
 
01:25:48.189 --> 01:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative Weber
 
01:25:50.930 --> 01:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
and my question is just jogged by
 
01:25:52.970 --> 01:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro's question thank
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question and thank
 
01:25:56.209 --> 01:25:56.219 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
01:25:56.219 --> 01:25:58.430 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
um

01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
um the requirement of an in-person visit
 
01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:09.719 align:start position:0%
to start the process which is already in
 
01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
our statutes isn't that the barrier to
 
01:26:16.729 --> 01:26:16.739 align:start position:0%
perhaps somebody who's in crisis
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
getting Telehealth rather than going to
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
it would present a barrier they have to
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
start with an in-person visit
 
01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:32.870 align:start position:0%
start with an in-person visit
um

01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
but there are I would really I'd like to
 
01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
defer I want to make sure that I don't
 
01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
that I don't mix the two up here I mean
 
01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
I think that representative Shapiro has
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
brought forward a reasonable you know
 
01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
line of thinking about the fact that we
 
01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
have these crises and we have people
 
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
that are boarding and do we would not
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
bringing them into departments but
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
triaging them before they got there
 
01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
actually prevent them from having to be
 
01:26:59.930 --> 01:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
boarded but receive treatment that's
 
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
what I believe we're talking about here
 
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure exactly what the best
 
01:27:06.649 --> 01:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
way to manage that is okay but thank you
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
representative Weber just one more time
 
01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:14.689 --> 01:27:14.699 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions okay thank
 
01:27:16.010 --> 01:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
you thank you chair McDonald it could be
 
01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.430 --> 01:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Lisa maccio
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
I've indicated you need three minutes
 
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what I was going to
 
01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:46.669 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what I was going to
suggest

01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:48.540 align:start position:0%

01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
agencies here in New Hampshire as part
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
of that mandate we are concerned with
 
01:28:11.209 --> 01:28:11.219 align:start position:0%
the protection of children and also the
 
01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
best interests of children our office
 
01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
had been looking forward to testifying
 
01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
in support of SB 238 as originally
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
drafted but unfortunately with the floor
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment we are now in opposition of
 
01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
this bill as potentially interfering
 
01:28:27.709 --> 01:28:27.719 align:start position:0%
with children's safety and their access
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
to safe and adequate Care by providers
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
during covid we saw that Mental Health
 
01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
Access was enhanced by telemedicine
 
01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
however we also saw a loss of trusted
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
and reliable reporters for children
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
namely schools and health care providers
 
01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
RSA 169 C the child protection act is
 
01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
intended to protect children but also to
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
look out for their best interest we know
 
01:28:57.709 --> 01:28:57.719 align:start position:0%
that children sometimes have barriers to
 
01:28:59.689 --> 01:28:59.699 align:start position:0%
reporting unmet needs or dangers in
 
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
their home one of which is a lack of
 
01:29:04.270 --> 01:29:04.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity and trusted in safe adults
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers Mental Health

Providers medical providers are one of
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
those safe spaces and we have
 
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
significant concerns with sections three
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
and five of this bill as amended that by
 
01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
holding providers to a standard very
 
01:29:21.169 --> 01:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
high standard of
 
01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
not allowing a potential offender access
 
01:29:26.090 --> 01:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
to a child's medical records could
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
really endanger children currently under
 
01:29:31.729 --> 01:29:31.739 align:start position:0%
169 C the standard for professional
 
01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
Child Protection workers assessment
 
01:29:36.649 --> 01:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
workers and their attorneys with dcyf is
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
only a preponderance of the evidence a
 
01:29:41.149 --> 01:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
relatively low standard just over 50
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
percent to take children away from their
 
01:29:46.010 --> 01:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
parents here we're asking health care
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
providers who are not trained assessment
 
01:29:51.169 --> 01:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
workers not trained to assess the safety
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
of a child held to a clear and
 
01:29:55.729 --> 01:29:55.739 align:start position:0%
convincing standard in order to protect
 
01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
a child's information and medical
 
01:29:59.390 --> 01:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
records from a potentially offending
 
01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
parent we do feel like this very high
 
01:30:05.330 --> 01:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
standard in the amended language would
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
interfere with a child's ability to
 
01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
access that safe and trusted
 
01:30:10.669 --> 01:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
professional knowing that their
 
01:30:13.610 --> 01:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
information would be protected typically
 
01:30:16.129 --> 01:30:16.139 align:start position:0%
a provider is a mandated reporter so
 
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
they would take that information report
 
01:30:19.850 --> 01:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
it to dcyf and allow their professionals
 
01:30:22.129 --> 01:30:22.139 align:start position:0%
to take over from there and they would
 
01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
also have protection to use their best
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
judgment when not releasing records to a
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
potentially offending parent this
 
01:30:30.530 --> 01:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
language changes all that and we do have
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
significant concerns for how that would
 
01:30:34.970 --> 01:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
endanger New Hampshire's children I'd be
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
01:30:43.490 --> 01:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and also thank you
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
the way I read through this bill
 
01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
the onus is placed upon the
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
provider or
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
the individual has a record to protect
 
01:31:00.169 --> 01:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
the record per se the onus isn't on the
 
01:31:02.209 --> 01:31:02.219 align:start position:0%
parent to go to the court to release the
 
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
record is that correct
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
um we're looking more specifically at
 
01:31:09.169 --> 01:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
the subsection B3 where the health care
 
01:31:12.290 --> 01:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
provider is required to determine by
 
01:31:14.330 --> 01:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence based on
 
01:31:16.970 --> 01:31:16.980 align:start position:0%
articulable facts when not to release
 
01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
based on a parent request
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
the the section before that with regards
 
01:31:24.649 --> 01:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
to the court was not really something
 
01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
we're looking at I think there are
 
01:31:28.250 --> 01:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
probably other agencies that would be
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
dealing with the court aspect so the
 
01:31:33.169 --> 01:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
onus is on the provider to defend
 
01:31:33.179 --> 01:31:34.370 align:start position:0%
onus is on the provider to defend
themselves

01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:36.300 align:start position:0%
versus that I'm trying to get to is the
 
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
parent having the parent has a right but
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
the right should be governed through the
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
court in others if the parent goes to
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
the court and the court says they agree
 
01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
with a parent with that also not allow
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
for the release of the record what I'm
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get to is a balance between
 
01:31:53.450 --> 01:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
the child being protected
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
so the parent so it was if the court
 
01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:00.900 align:start position:0%
determines that there's no issue for the
 
01:32:03.410 --> 01:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
parent to have access to the record at
 
01:32:05.209 --> 01:32:05.219 align:start position:0%
least it's going through a court in
 
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
order to obtain the access it's not
 
01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
putting the owners back on the provider
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
trying to make that determination
 
01:32:14.209 --> 01:32:14.219 align:start position:0%
the concern is the initial determination
 
01:32:16.490 --> 01:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
for the provider to withhold the record
 
01:32:18.649 --> 01:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
in the first instance is a very high
 
01:32:20.530 --> 01:32:20.540 align:start position:0%
standard of clear and convincing
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise they would
 
01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
I would presume feel they would need to
 
01:32:26.689 --> 01:32:26.699 align:start position:0%
release the record which could
 
01:32:27.890 --> 01:32:27.900 align:start position:0%
potentially interfere with an
 
01:32:30.530 --> 01:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
investigation if the offending parent is
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
getting that record in the first
 
01:32:34.129 --> 01:32:34.139 align:start position:0%
instance I think Court action would come
 
01:32:35.209 --> 01:32:35.219 align:start position:0%
too late
 
01:32:37.090 --> 01:32:37.100 align:start position:0%
um kind of let the horse out of the barn
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
we reverse that Mr chair sure if we
 
01:32:43.729 --> 01:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
reverse that and make it that the only
 
01:32:46.129 --> 01:32:46.139 align:start position:0%
time the record can be released is with
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
it takes the provider off the hook
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
because they're not having to worry
 
01:32:54.890 --> 01:32:54.900 align:start position:0%
about what they're trying to do to
 
01:32:56.750 --> 01:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
defend themselves and justify what
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
they're doing is up to the court to make
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
a decision
 
01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think the
 
01:33:03.530 --> 01:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
language is still not clear as to who
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
would have standing to bring it to court
 
01:33:09.410 --> 01:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
who's coming to court and even which
 
01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:10.790 align:start position:0%
who's coming to court and even which
court

01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
um but again I think there are probably
 
01:33:13.850 --> 01:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
other agencies that would deal with that
 
01:33:15.410 --> 01:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
court side of it
 
01:33:18.649 --> 01:33:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.810 --> 01:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
thank you so have I understood correctly
 
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
that you would prefer the language of
 
01:33:26.209 --> 01:33:26.219 align:start position:0%
the original bill which is at least has
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
the advantage of being written down
 
01:33:30.169 --> 01:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
somewhere rather than this language
 
01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think the
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
original bill with the intent simply to
 
01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:35.689 align:start position:0%
original bill with the intent simply to
expand

01:33:35.689 --> 01:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
expand
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
Telehealth medicine for mental health
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
purposes the OCA is in support of we saw
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
during covet just how helpful that can
 
01:33:44.810 --> 01:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
be and necessary for a lot of people
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
including children in our state
 
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro so I'm sorry
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
could I have one sure I'm late here so
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
is is the issue I'm sorry I didn't look
 
01:33:56.689 --> 01:33:56.699 align:start position:0%
at the Senate version the original
 
01:33:59.390 --> 01:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
version is is the issue here that this
 
01:34:01.370 --> 01:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
is language that was not in the original
 
01:34:03.410 --> 01:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
version because it has now been included
 
01:34:05.330 --> 01:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
okay thank you this language is very
 
01:34:07.729 --> 01:34:07.739 align:start position:0%
similar to SB 253 which I believe you
 
01:34:09.530 --> 01:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
are hearing next week right thank you
 
01:34:12.169 --> 01:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro representative
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
Weber asked my question okay thank you
 
01:34:16.669 --> 01:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
01:34:19.850 --> 01:34:19.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:34:21.169 --> 01:34:21.179 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just want to be
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
really clear on
 
01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
um where you're at with this so are you
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
saying that you would like
 
01:34:29.770 --> 01:34:29.780 align:start position:0%
children to be able to access
 
01:34:32.050 --> 01:34:32.060 align:start position:0%
Telehealth mental health
 
01:34:35.570 --> 01:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
medication treatment without knowledge
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
of parents or their consent on a blanket
 
01:34:40.729 --> 01:34:40.739 align:start position:0%
basis for every child
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
the office's positions at the original
 
01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
Bill language is something we would
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
support I'd have to see what alternate
 
01:34:49.610 --> 01:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
language you're suggesting the way their
 
01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
bill was originally written the OCA
 
01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
other questions representative palazzov
 
01:34:59.930 --> 01:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:01.639 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
so follow up on what a representative
 
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
Cushman is asking so help me understand
 
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
so if you already
 
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
have limitations for abusive parents
 
01:35:16.729 --> 01:35:16.739 align:start position:0%
like what are other situations are
 
01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
concerned for you is it like
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
about prescribing puberty blockers that
 
01:35:25.729 --> 01:35:25.739 align:start position:0%
you want to do with original bill or is
 
01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
it like
 
01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
maybe some vaccination prescription and
 
01:35:31.629 --> 01:35:31.639 align:start position:0%
if parent is
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
vaccine hesitant so what are other
 
01:35:35.159 --> 01:35:36.590 align:start position:0%
vaccine hesitant so what are other
scenarios

01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
scenarios
 
01:35:41.689 --> 01:35:41.699 align:start position:0%
aside from abusive that you are trying
 
01:35:46.189 --> 01:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
to avoid by opposing this bill
 
01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think the
 
01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
office is
 
01:35:51.649 --> 01:35:51.659 align:start position:0%
um concern is with the way this bill
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
language is worded that would interfere
 
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
with the medical provider's ability to
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
focus on providing Medical Care and
 
01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
instead be having to worry about
 
01:36:06.169 --> 01:36:06.179 align:start position:0%
assessing a child's safety when deciding
 
01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
parents already have the right to access
 
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
to Children's Medical Records under the
 
01:36:12.649 --> 01:36:12.659 align:start position:0%
law it is with certain carve outs this
 
01:36:12.659 --> 01:36:14.149 align:start position:0%
law it is with certain carve outs this
law

01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
creates an onus on a medical provider to
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
very high standard of uh evidence in
 
01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
which cases they would not
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
release records to a a parent or
 
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
Guardian what those specific concerns
 
01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:31.860 align:start position:0%
would be would be case specific in the
 
01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate does believe
 
01:36:35.410 --> 01:36:35.420 align:start position:0%
that should be left to the providers
 
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable judgment not to this very
 
01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
high standard that would interfere with
 
01:36:42.169 --> 01:36:42.179 align:start position:0%
their ability to provide appropriate
 
01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
care to a minor
 
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh taking my follow-up
 
01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:51.649 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh taking my follow-up
question

01:36:51.649 --> 01:36:51.659 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
um can you understand me uh bigger
 
01:36:56.209 --> 01:36:56.219 align:start position:0%
picture so we are saying that most
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
parents are good parents but some are
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
abusive for otherwise uh interrupting
 
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
with uh what's good for medical care and
 
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
safety of kids could the same be told
 
01:37:13.490 --> 01:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
about medical providers or
 
01:37:17.209 --> 01:37:17.219 align:start position:0%
is there anything that your office of
 
01:37:21.229 --> 01:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
child advocate like would try to protect
 
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
from cases when there's some
 
01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't think I understand
 
01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
 
01:37:41.090 --> 01:37:41.100 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chairman and thank
 
01:37:45.169 --> 01:37:45.179 align:start position:0%
you for taking my next question which is
 
01:37:45.179 --> 01:37:47.870 align:start position:0%
you for taking my next question which is
uh

01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
am I correct in thinking that the bill
 
01:37:51.890 --> 01:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
as it originally stood
 
01:37:56.450 --> 01:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
made no change in the existing law about
 
01:37:59.590 --> 01:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
access to Children's Medical Records so
 
01:38:03.890 --> 01:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
it not only did not further restrict act
 
01:38:07.129 --> 01:38:07.139 align:start position:0%
it did not expand access for parents but
 
01:38:09.110 --> 01:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
it didn't restrict access further for
 
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
parents either it's simply left
 
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
that part of our current statute intact
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
and allowed whatever could be done
 
01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
in person allowed these things in this
 
01:38:24.530 --> 01:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
statute that could be done in person
 
01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
also to be done by Telehealth thank you
 
01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
for the question that is my
 
01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
understanding it is my understanding
 
01:38:32.209 --> 01:38:32.219 align:start position:0%
that parents already have a right to ask
 
01:38:34.490 --> 01:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
success under New Hampshire law thank
 
01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:35.330 align:start position:0%
success under New Hampshire law thank
you

01:38:35.330 --> 01:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
01:38:38.930 --> 01:38:38.940 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you very much for
 
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
being here and providing your testimony
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
both written and in person my question
 
01:38:45.410 --> 01:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
to you is that it's my understanding
 
01:38:47.209 --> 01:38:47.219 align:start position:0%
that all these providers are mandatory
 
01:38:49.010 --> 01:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
reporters and so if they have a concern
 
01:38:51.770 --> 01:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
about the parent that should be part of
 
01:38:54.050 --> 01:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
their involvement in the exam and if
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
they believe that the child is in an
 
01:38:57.290 --> 01:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
abusive situation or otherwise at risk
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
isn't that something that they're
 
01:38:59.870 --> 01:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
already looking for when they're
 
01:39:01.370 --> 01:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
interacting with these with these
 
01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:02.149 align:start position:0%
interacting with these with these
children

01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:39:04.850 --> 01:39:04.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I am not a
 
01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
medical professional so I can't speak to
 
01:39:09.050 --> 01:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
to specifics as far as medical ethics
 
01:39:11.629 --> 01:39:11.639 align:start position:0%
but yes frankly every adult in the state
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is a mandated reporter
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
as I said one of the most frequent
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
entrusted reporters are Health Care
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
Providers and their obligation is to
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
report their concerns to the agency to
 
01:39:29.149 --> 01:39:29.159 align:start position:0%
dcyf to conduct a professional
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
investigation by trained um
 
01:39:35.570 --> 01:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
assessment workers as far as what their
 
01:39:37.129 --> 01:39:37.139 align:start position:0%
obligations are to record it within
 
01:39:39.050 --> 01:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
their notes I'm sure there are others
 
01:39:40.490 --> 01:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
here that could speak to to that
 
01:39:43.250 --> 01:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
obligation specifically
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
um as a follower
 
01:39:45.950 --> 01:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
um as a follow-up
 
01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:47.149 align:start position:0%
um as a follow-up
um

01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:49.310 --> 01:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
I I guess my question here is if there's
 
01:39:52.129 --> 01:39:52.139 align:start position:0%
been a report made to dcyf wouldn't that
 
01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
be sufficient to note in their in their
 
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
notes that they had a concern about the
 
01:39:57.890 --> 01:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
child's safety and therefore they were
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
referred to dcyf and that would be a
 
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
more than adequate indication that they
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
in in order to not release the records
 
01:40:11.570 --> 01:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
to the parent yes
 
01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that's what this
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
language says clear and convincing is a
 
01:40:18.290 --> 01:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
very high legal standard and as well as
 
01:40:20.930 --> 01:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
needing articulable facts and have it
 
01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
fully documented essentially putting a
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
medical professional
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
in the place of a safety assessment
 
01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
professional which they are not so again
 
01:40:33.649 --> 01:40:33.659 align:start position:0%
I couldn't speak to as far as what a
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
medical professional's requirements are
 
01:40:37.149 --> 01:40:37.159 align:start position:0%
for their documentation
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
but I used to be a dcyf attorney reports
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
that come in do not rise to the level of
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing that is not the job
 
01:40:46.669 --> 01:40:46.679 align:start position:0%
of the reporter it's the job of the
 
01:40:49.129 --> 01:40:49.139 align:start position:0%
agency to investigate and in fact as I
 
01:40:52.490 --> 01:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
said 169 C the standard to take a child
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
away from a biological parent in an
 
01:40:57.110 --> 01:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
abuse proceeding is only preponderance
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
not clear and convincing but we're
 
01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
asking that medical providers somehow
 
01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:03.719 align:start position:0%
have evidence rising to clear and
 
01:41:06.530 --> 01:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
convincing at the outset not a
 
01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
professional investigator so that
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
there's a discrepancy there that could
 
01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
lead to
 
01:41:15.770 --> 01:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
barriers within that relationship and
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
harm children
 
01:41:18.290 --> 01:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
thank you that was definitely more
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
detail thank you other questions
 
01:41:25.250 --> 01:41:25.260 align:start position:0%

01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
so I have two if I may one I think
 
01:41:36.649 --> 01:41:36.659 align:start position:0%
trying to get at the number of perhaps
 
01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%
representative palazzov's question
 
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
because I think this reporting
 
01:41:43.729 --> 01:41:43.739 align:start position:0%
although not directly related by the
 
01:41:48.050 --> 01:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
bill is is very important to it isn't it
 
01:41:50.570 --> 01:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
true that if somebody anybody a parent
 
01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:52.430 align:start position:0%
true that if somebody anybody a parent
or

01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:53.750 align:start position:0%
or
um

01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
other medical professionals think that a
 
01:41:58.689 --> 01:41:58.699 align:start position:0%
medical professional is harming a child
 
01:42:02.330 --> 01:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
in any way then they must report the
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
medical professional
 
01:42:08.450 --> 01:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
presumably both to dcyf and and their
 
01:42:10.669 --> 01:42:10.679 align:start position:0%
and their professional licensing board
 
01:42:12.590 --> 01:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification and I'm
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't understand that initially
 
01:42:14.159 --> 01:42:16.189 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't understand that initially
again

01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:42:18.530 --> 01:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
all adults in New Hampshire are mandated
 
01:42:21.649 --> 01:42:21.659 align:start position:0%
reporters to the division as far as
 
01:42:24.649 --> 01:42:24.659 align:start position:0%
child abuse or neglect were concerned I
 
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to speak to what
 
01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
ethical obligations that one medical
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
provider may have to report to the
 
01:42:31.729 --> 01:42:31.739 align:start position:0%
medical board but certainly all adults
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
are required to
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
report any abuse or neglect they suspect
 
01:42:40.129 --> 01:42:40.139 align:start position:0%
and well and it's not it's not quite a
 
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up but uh with regarding the
 
01:42:45.169 --> 01:42:45.179 align:start position:0%
issues of standard and proof we have
 
01:42:48.169 --> 01:42:48.179 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing proof
 
01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
um and then and that means that you
 
01:42:54.169 --> 01:42:54.179 align:start position:0%
actually have real am I correct that
 
01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's real and true evidence as opposed
 
01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.209 align:start position:0%
that's real and true evidence as opposed
to

01:42:59.209 --> 01:42:59.219 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:43:01.970 --> 01:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
the second level which is preponderance
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
of the evidence which just means that
 
01:43:07.250 --> 01:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
there's more evidence that abuse is
 
01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
there than there is evidence that abuse
 
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
isn't there is that right
 
01:43:13.970 --> 01:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
I've probably phrased that in artfully
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
as the as to the preponderance standard
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
generally preponderance is just over 50
 
01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
percent not not a terribly it does
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
require evidence right um but clear and
 
01:43:26.090 --> 01:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
convincing is substanti substantially
 
01:43:27.729 --> 01:43:27.739 align:start position:0%
higher than that to put it into context
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
as I said 169 C requires preponderance
 
01:43:33.410 --> 01:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
to take children away it requires clear
 
01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
and convincing to terminate a parent's
 
01:43:37.609 --> 01:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
parental rights right oh that's very
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
helpful and then one final question
 
01:43:40.609 --> 01:43:40.619 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:43:43.310 --> 01:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
and isn't it true that the reporting
 
01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:44.629 align:start position:0%
and isn't it true that the reporting
level

01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:43:47.570 --> 01:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
is much lower than that you just have to
 
01:43:50.810 --> 01:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
have a suspicion that it's happening and
 
01:43:52.850 --> 01:43:52.860 align:start position:0%
that requires you to report is that not
 
01:43:52.860 --> 01:43:54.109 align:start position:0%
that requires you to report is that not
true

01:43:54.109 --> 01:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
true
 
01:43:58.609 --> 01:43:58.619 align:start position:0%
a suspicion that a child is being abused
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
to report to require that you have an
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
obligation to report you you don't have
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
to be able to prove it thank you for the
 
01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
question the office of child advocate
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
would like to believe that everyone
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
understands the standard to be low you
 
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
should always call the division if you
 
01:44:15.169 --> 01:44:15.179 align:start position:0%
have a concern
 
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh the child Advocates uh
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
efforts are to protect all children so
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
so the standard should be as low as
 
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
possible to any suspicion that's why
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
there are trained professionals to then
 
01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
investigate and ensure that that child
 
01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
is safe
 
01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:44:37.129 --> 01:44:37.139 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman
 
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of the
 
01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:40.550 align:start position:0%
in terms of the
urgency

01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
urgency
 
01:44:43.609 --> 01:44:43.619 align:start position:0%
um related to the May 11th end of the
 
01:44:43.619 --> 01:44:45.649 align:start position:0%
um related to the May 11th end of the
emergency

01:44:45.649 --> 01:44:45.659 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:44:45.659 --> 01:44:47.109 align:start position:0%
emergency
um

01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
aren't we isn't it true that we're only
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
talking about schedule two through four
 
01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:55.070 align:start position:0%
talking about schedule two through four
medications

01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
medications
 
01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
um I didn't I didn't know what those
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
were really until I checked with our
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
resident pharmacist and that um
 
01:45:04.990 --> 01:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
and that most psychiatric medications
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
will be can be can be prescribed by
 
01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:11.750 align:start position:0%
will be can be can be prescribed by
Telehealth

01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
Telehealth
 
01:45:14.689 --> 01:45:14.699 align:start position:0%
um whether we pass this bill or not
 
01:45:16.609 --> 01:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
thank you for that only a subset like
 
01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
stimulant medications will not be
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
allowed to be prescribed I am afraid I
 
01:45:22.729 --> 01:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
do not have expertise in that area
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
either I would also defer to your
 
01:45:29.570 --> 01:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
resident expert for that that is correct
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
another question schedule two three
 
01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you very
 
01:45:41.689 --> 01:45:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
so anti-psychotic medication
 
01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:45.490 align:start position:0%
so anti-psychotic medication
antidepressants

01:45:45.490 --> 01:45:45.500 align:start position:0%
antidepressants
 
01:45:48.109 --> 01:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Matthew Hood
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
from Dartmouth Health control
 
01:45:57.890 --> 01:45:57.900 align:start position:0%

chairman members of the committee for
 
01:46:06.050 --> 01:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Matthew Hood vice
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
president of government relations at
 
01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth health I apologize for the
 
01:46:10.370 --> 01:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
raspiness of my voice I'm on the tail
 
01:46:11.570 --> 01:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
end of a cold
 
01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
um hopefully I'll it's good that you're
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
sitting way out there wait I've settled
 
01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
way over here exactly right um I will be
 
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
brief I
 
01:46:25.250 --> 01:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
um we we support uh Senate Bill 238
 
01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
um as Senator Apprentice said we've seen
 
01:46:28.850 --> 01:46:28.860 align:start position:0%
the value of Telehealth including
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
Telehealth prescribing during the
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic and Beyond think about the
 
01:46:34.250 --> 01:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
context of the workforce shortage which
 
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
continues into today that didn't go away
 
01:46:40.490 --> 01:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
when the pandemic uh concluded
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:49.129 --> 01:46:49.139 align:start position:0%
as I read 238 it enables Telehealth
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
prescribing for mental health practice
 
01:46:54.350 --> 01:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:46:56.930 --> 01:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
in addition to the current statute which
 
01:46:58.669 --> 01:46:58.679 align:start position:0%
allows for Telehealth prescribing for
 
01:47:00.410 --> 01:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder
 
01:47:03.649 --> 01:47:03.659 align:start position:0%
that's that's where it ends
 
01:47:03.659 --> 01:47:04.490 align:start position:0%
that's that's where it ends
um

01:47:04.490 --> 01:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
to representative Nagel's question
 
01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
earlier House Bill 500
 
01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
um flips the Paradigm and it allows
 
01:47:14.050 --> 01:47:14.060 align:start position:0%
Telehealth prescribing for everything
 
01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:16.139 align:start position:0%
that includes
 
01:47:19.370 --> 01:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
Cancer Care that includes post-surgical
 
01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
kit pain management that includes
 
01:47:23.930 --> 01:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
palliative care my colleague was here
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
last time if you remember for 500 who
 
01:47:27.790 --> 01:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
was in the palliative care space
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
and so I would be remiss if I didn't say
 
01:47:33.410 --> 01:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
reiterate my appreciation for this
 
01:47:35.050 --> 01:47:35.060 align:start position:0%
committee's work
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
representative Leon and Merchant in
 
01:47:38.570 --> 01:47:38.580 align:start position:0%
particular are working on Amendment on
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
that bill which passed out of this
 
01:47:41.570 --> 01:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
committee 20 to nothing and then of a
 
01:47:44.090 --> 01:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
Voice vote out of the house so thank you
 
01:47:46.609 --> 01:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
for that and I hope we see 500 go for or
 
01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
come out of the Senate as well quickly
 
01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:53.570 align:start position:0%
come out of the Senate as well quickly
um

01:47:53.570 --> 01:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
what else would I like to add that's
 
01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
really what I wanted to make make sure
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
that I reiterated for the committee I
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
did wanted to speak though to two other
 
01:48:04.250 --> 01:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
points one is to the
 
01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:04.910 align:start position:0%
points one is to the
um

01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
the safeguards that exist with respect
 
01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
to prescribing we talked about uh the
 
01:48:12.530 --> 01:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
DEA proposed guidance that's that has
 
01:48:14.450 --> 01:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
come out so when May 11th rolls around
 
01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
what is it going to look like and the
 
01:48:18.410 --> 01:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
DEA guidance requires in almost all
 
01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
situations the establishment of an
 
01:48:22.609 --> 01:48:22.619 align:start position:0%
in-person relationship with a patient
 
01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
before prescribing and then of course
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statute also required
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
requires a visit as is appropriate for
 
01:48:31.729 --> 01:48:31.739 align:start position:0%
the patient or the condition but no less
 
01:48:33.770 --> 01:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
than once a year so there are safeguards
 
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
around this prescribing via Telehealth
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
that I felt it was important to comment
 
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
on as well
 
01:48:43.129 --> 01:48:43.139 align:start position:0%
finally I will say that for 238 the
 
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
consent provision that you have that was
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
added by the senate in terms of consent
 
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
for a minor
 
01:48:48.119 --> 01:48:48.770 align:start position:0%
for a minor
um

01:48:48.770 --> 01:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:50.450 --> 01:48:50.460 align:start position:0%
to be prescribed medication via
 
01:48:52.729 --> 01:48:52.739 align:start position:0%
Telehealth we worked with the Senate on
 
01:48:54.169 --> 01:48:54.179 align:start position:0%
that language we're very comfortable
 
01:48:55.970 --> 01:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
with where that language is right now
 
01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
and we're happy to
 
01:49:00.410 --> 01:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
work with this body should it be so
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
inclined on the access to medical
 
01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
records component that was added also by
 
01:49:08.090 --> 01:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
the Senate but which we find currently a
 
01:49:10.490 --> 01:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
bit problematic in that it's
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with Federal requirements
 
01:49:14.570 --> 01:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
as we understand them so I will end
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
there and happily take questions and
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate your consideration thank you
 
01:49:21.649 --> 01:49:21.659 align:start position:0%
yes representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
now I'm nervous again
 
01:49:29.890 --> 01:49:29.900 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me critical that um both
 
01:49:33.229 --> 01:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
500 and 238 pass or my goals aren't
 
01:49:33.239 --> 01:49:34.370 align:start position:0%
500 and 238 pass or my goals aren't
achieved

01:49:34.370 --> 01:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
achieved
 
01:49:37.250 --> 01:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
am I wrong about that my answer to your
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
question representative and I think
 
01:49:41.090 --> 01:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
anyone would people would agree with
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
this behind me if they're going to
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
testify subsequently
 
01:49:46.729 --> 01:49:46.739 align:start position:0%
House Bill 500 does everything and more
 
01:49:49.609 --> 01:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
than what Senate Bill 238 does so simple
 
01:49:52.729 --> 01:49:52.739 align:start position:0%
238 is great it expect it extends it to
 
01:49:55.609 --> 01:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
mental health but that's it and so 500
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
covers a much broader swath of practice
 
01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:00.830 align:start position:0%
covers a much broader swath of practice
areas

01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
um would P I'm sorry follow up would
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
there be any opposition from your mind
 
01:50:07.970 --> 01:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
about adding
 
01:50:10.010 --> 01:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
um I mean we could refine the language I
 
01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
think but for pain management to have
 
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
that specifically in this bill I I would
 
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
I would hesitate to go down the road of
 
01:50:18.109 --> 01:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
enumerating practice areas in which you
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
can prescribe via Telehealth to be
 
01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
honest with you representative I'd be
 
01:50:23.209 --> 01:50:23.219 align:start position:0%
much rather inclined to do it Hospital
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
500 did which was to say you can okay in
 
01:50:28.370 --> 01:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
this situation because you you'll leave
 
01:50:30.169 --> 01:50:30.179 align:start position:0%
something out with all due respect
 
01:50:32.030 --> 01:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
you're right thank you thank you
 
01:50:33.410 --> 01:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
representative Leon and then
 
01:50:35.330 --> 01:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
representative Weber uh thank you Mr
 
01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you very much for
 
01:50:37.970 --> 01:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
being here
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
um so it's my understanding that you
 
01:50:41.570 --> 01:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
believe that house bill 500 is
 
01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
sufficient and that this bill if 500
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
passes is not necessary with all due
 
01:50:49.609 --> 01:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
respects my friend Senator Prentice yes
 
01:50:51.530 --> 01:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
I believe that that's correct thank you
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
she knows that I was going to say that I
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
think so yeah
 
01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
my question was asked and answered thank
 
01:51:00.119 --> 01:51:01.910 align:start position:0%
my question was asked and answered thank
you

01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
01:51:07.250 --> 01:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
yeah just uh just a kind of a procedural
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
question do you think there is any way
 
01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
where this legislation or HB 500 might
 
01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
actually end up creating an environment
 
01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
where those folks desire
 
01:51:22.970 --> 01:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
um the in-person interaction
 
01:51:25.850 --> 01:51:25.860 align:start position:0%
um may have their access Limited in that
 
01:51:28.129 --> 01:51:28.139 align:start position:0%
regard because we're moving due to
 
01:51:29.870 --> 01:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
Resource constraints more and more to
 
01:51:33.169 --> 01:51:33.179 align:start position:0%
help Telehealth and that you might find
 
01:51:34.669 --> 01:51:34.679 align:start position:0%
people saying actually we're going to
 
01:51:36.290 --> 01:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
curb down this and actually it's only
 
01:51:39.169 --> 01:51:39.179 align:start position:0%
available to Telehealth do you see any
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
scenario where that might come to pass
 
01:51:43.729 --> 01:51:43.739 align:start position:0%
through legislation like this that's a
 
01:51:44.570 --> 01:51:44.580 align:start position:0%
great question thank you for the
 
01:51:46.850 --> 01:51:46.860 align:start position:0%
question representative my inclination
 
01:51:49.010 --> 01:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
at this juncture in time is that the
 
01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
answer would be no
 
01:51:51.770 --> 01:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
um and the reason for that is because we
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
want to be patient-centered if a patient
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
wants an in-person visit they're going
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
to get an in-person visit if they want a
 
01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
Telehealth visit and there are many
 
01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
reasons for wanting a Telehealth visit
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
we'll try to accommodate a Telehealth
 
01:52:03.649 --> 01:52:03.659 align:start position:0%
visit it's more about for me we saw a
 
01:52:06.050 --> 01:52:06.060 align:start position:0%
spot Lake in Telehealth services at the
 
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
beginning of the pandemic and that is
 
01:52:09.770 --> 01:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
consider a drop off and a leveling off
 
01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
of it since that point in time since the
 
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
pike Spike and so for me this enables
 
01:52:18.169 --> 01:52:18.179 align:start position:0%
access for those who might have a hard
 
01:52:20.209 --> 01:52:20.219 align:start position:0%
time getting for an in-person or not
 
01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
wanting it in person but it's not going
 
01:52:23.330 --> 01:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
to replace in-person care we're not at
 
01:52:25.070 --> 01:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
that point yet
 
01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.770 --> 01:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions okay thank you
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair members of

01:53:12.169 --> 01:53:12.179 align:start position:0%
238
 
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
it's no secret secret that New Hampshire
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
is amid a mental health crisis in New
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 221 000 adults have a mental
 
01:53:20.930 --> 01:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
health condition including 57 000 who
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
have a serious mental illness if they're
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
further exacerbating this crisis Granite
 
01:53:26.209 --> 01:53:26.219 align:start position:0%
State or struggled to get the help they
 
01:53:28.129 --> 01:53:28.139 align:start position:0%
need when they need it due in part to
 
01:53:29.709 --> 01:53:29.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Workforce shortage
 
01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
providers can't meet our state's level
 
01:53:33.770 --> 01:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
of need through current channels
 
01:53:35.930 --> 01:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
telemedicine is one crucial tool to be
 
01:53:37.970 --> 01:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
used in addressing this issue and
 
01:53:39.290 --> 01:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
increasing access to Mental Health
 
01:53:41.209 --> 01:53:41.219 align:start position:0%
Services especially in rural areas of
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
the state as you heard earlier during
 
01:53:45.229 --> 01:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
the pandemic several emergency orders
 
01:53:47.090 --> 01:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
were issued which expanded telemedicine
 
01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
these emergency orders allowed providers
 
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
to provide all medically necessary
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
Services remotely when telemedicine was
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
passed into state law last year it
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
contained restrictions on the
 
01:53:57.950 --> 01:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
prescription of certain medications SB
 
01:54:00.169 --> 01:54:00.179 align:start position:0%
238 would codify a more expansive
 
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
prescribing law for mental health
 
01:54:03.410 --> 01:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
conditions therefore putting in thereby
 
01:54:04.729 --> 01:54:04.739 align:start position:0%
putting the statute parts of the
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
emergency orders from the pandemic
 
01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
telemedicine expands access to care for
 
01:54:11.930 --> 01:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
all and is well suited to many of the
 
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
challenges those living with mental
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
health conditions may experience
 
01:54:16.250 --> 01:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
through supporting the mental health
 
01:54:17.930 --> 01:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
Workforce and lowering barriers to care
 
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
SB 238 would go far in addressing the
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
Mental Health crisis in our state urge
 
01:54:23.689 --> 01:54:23.699 align:start position:0%

okay seeing no questions thank you very
 
01:54:31.199 --> 01:54:36.470 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no questions thank you very
much

01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:36.480 align:start position:0%

thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
my name is Laura Condon I'm from Bedford
 
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I oppose Senate Bill
 
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
238 relative to the use of telemedicine
 
01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
to treat mental health conditions I've
 
01:55:22.930 --> 01:55:22.940 align:start position:0%
provided a couple of handouts for you
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
this bill will permit Physicians
 
01:55:26.689 --> 01:55:26.699 align:start position:0%
surgeons and nurses to prescribe
 
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
schedule 2 through schedule four drugs
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
drugs considered Dangerous by the U.S
 
01:55:33.590 --> 01:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
Drug Enforcement Administration your
 
01:55:35.209 --> 01:55:35.219 align:start position:0%
correct representative Shapiro that
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
other drugs still could be prescribed by
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
a Telehealth but these are scheduled
 
01:55:42.770 --> 01:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
dangerous drugs for very good reasons
 
01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:43.390 align:start position:0%
dangerous drugs for very good reasons
um

01:55:43.390 --> 01:55:43.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
these controlled drugs can be very
 
01:55:47.330 --> 01:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
dangerous even deadly to the person
 
01:55:49.250 --> 01:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
prescribe the drug their family members
 
01:55:51.530 --> 01:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
schoolmates and co-workers people who
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
seek these drugs should be carefully
 
01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:55.679 align:start position:0%
evaluated monitored in person
 
01:55:58.490 --> 01:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
this is not the time for Telehealth it
 
01:56:02.090 --> 01:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
is dangerous one face-to-face visit for
 
01:56:04.189 --> 01:56:04.199 align:start position:0%
children is neglect
 
01:56:07.070 --> 01:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
more monitoring is needed children and
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
this is is no limit this could be
 
01:56:10.729 --> 01:56:10.739 align:start position:0%
infants toddlers you know preschool
 
01:56:12.649 --> 01:56:12.659 align:start position:0%
children There's No Limit here they
 
01:56:15.890 --> 01:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
develop at a very rapid rate we we owe
 
01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
them the requirement that they be seen
 
01:56:20.570 --> 01:56:20.580 align:start position:0%
more frequently than one established
 
01:56:22.910 --> 01:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
visit and then additional drugs in a
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
cocktail and dosages up and down can be
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
done simply by a Telehealth these
 
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
scheduled and the handout it provided
 
01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
you is from the diversion control
 
01:56:34.250 --> 01:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
Division and it shows the scheduled two
 
01:56:35.930 --> 01:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
three and four drugs so that you could
 
01:56:38.330 --> 01:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
be more familiar with them these are
 
01:56:40.250 --> 01:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
drugs that have high potential for abuse
 
01:56:42.890 --> 01:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
and may lead to severe psychological and
 
01:56:44.570 --> 01:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
physical dependence and include such
 
01:56:47.410 --> 01:56:47.420 align:start position:0%
drugs as oxycodone fentanyl morphine
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
amphetamines such as adderall
 
01:56:51.410 --> 01:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
methamphetamines methylphenidate and
 
01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:53.810 align:start position:0%
methamphetamines methylphenidate and
phenobarbital

01:56:53.810 --> 01:56:53.820 align:start position:0%
phenobarbital
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
for your information phenobarbital is a
 
01:56:58.729 --> 01:56:58.739 align:start position:0%
sedative that slows the activity of the
 
01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
brain and nervous system and is commonly
 
01:57:05.689 --> 01:57:05.699 align:start position:0%
used to euthanize pets and since 2010 14
 
01:57:08.090 --> 01:57:08.100 align:start position:0%
states have used phenobarbital and state
 
01:57:10.490 --> 01:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
executions these are very dangerous
 
01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:11.570 align:start position:0%
executions these are very dangerous
drugs

01:57:11.570 --> 01:57:11.580 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
01:57:13.490 --> 01:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
just how dangerous are these
 
01:57:15.410 --> 01:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
prescription mind-altering drugs well
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
they're deadly in fact in January of
 
01:57:20.810 --> 01:57:20.820 align:start position:0%
this year there was a woman she was a
 
01:57:23.089 --> 01:57:23.099 align:start position:0%
nurse Nancy Clancy in Massachusetts you
 
01:57:25.490 --> 01:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
may recall that she strangled her three
 
01:57:28.370 --> 01:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
young children slit her wrists slit her
 
01:57:30.169 --> 01:57:30.179 align:start position:0%
throat jumped out a window paralyzed
 
01:57:32.689 --> 01:57:32.699 align:start position:0%
herself she killed her children this was
 
01:57:35.570 --> 01:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
not some sort of street drug addict this
 
01:57:38.209 --> 01:57:38.219 align:start position:0%
is a well-respected nurse who in
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
postpartum depression was prescribed a
 
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
cocktail of 13 different drugs it made
 
01:57:48.109 --> 01:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
her crazy her children are dead lives
 
01:57:51.050 --> 01:57:51.060 align:start position:0%
are ruined the risk of suicide in
 
01:57:52.669 --> 01:57:52.679 align:start position:0%
Children and adolescents being treated
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
with antidepressants as well established
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
science the Food and Drug Administration
 
01:57:59.209 --> 01:57:59.219 align:start position:0%
requires Black Box warnings and have
 
01:58:01.270 --> 01:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
expanded that warning over the years
 
01:58:03.290 --> 01:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
monitoring of children requires
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
face-to-face in person interactions and
 
01:58:07.609 --> 01:58:07.619 align:start position:0%
observations that cannot be done via
 
01:58:10.189 --> 01:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
Telehealth as many who are treated for
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
depression are prescribed a cocktail of
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
drugs that would include the mix of the
 
01:58:16.430 --> 01:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
class of drugs included in this bill
 
01:58:19.609 --> 01:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
provisional data from cdc's own records
 
01:58:22.490 --> 01:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
show that during Telehealth there was a
 
01:58:24.649 --> 01:58:24.659 align:start position:0%
four percent increase I'll wrap it up
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
four percent increase in suicides during
 
01:58:30.169 --> 01:58:30.179 align:start position:0%
this period of time clearly Telehealth
 
01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
is not working
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
this bill neglects to protect children
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
from aggressive and dangerous
 
01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
prescribing of ever-changing cocktail or
 
01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
psychotropic drugs shamefully only
 
01:58:42.189 --> 01:58:42.199 align:start position:0%
requiring consent from a parent once
 
01:58:44.149 --> 01:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
irrespective of how many prescription
 
01:58:46.129 --> 01:58:46.139 align:start position:0%
doses are changed or new drugs are added
 
01:58:49.010 --> 01:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
to this cocktail there is no evidence of
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
safety of these cocktails of drugs I
 
01:58:55.209 --> 01:58:55.219 align:start position:0%
proposed in the handout an amendment
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
that would provide protection for minor
 
01:59:00.589 --> 01:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
children and I ask that you carefully
 
01:59:03.050 --> 01:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
consider that I think we owe our
 
01:59:05.810 --> 01:59:05.820 align:start position:0%
children protection of these scheduled
 
01:59:08.510 --> 01:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
drugs we recognize that mental health
 
01:59:10.250 --> 01:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
treatment should be more readily
 
01:59:12.589 --> 01:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
available there are many safe methods of
 
01:59:14.450 --> 01:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
treating including counseling Behavior
 
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
exercise even
 
01:59:19.550 --> 01:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
um please wrap up yep to improve health
 
01:59:23.149 --> 01:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
I urge you to oppose Senate Bill 238 as
 
01:59:25.370 --> 01:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
written or men it will protections for
 
01:59:26.750 --> 01:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
children thank you very much for your
 
01:59:28.490 --> 01:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
time happy to address any questions
 
01:59:31.370 --> 01:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Shapiro thank
 
01:59:33.169 --> 01:59:33.179 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
01:59:36.350 --> 01:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question um I
 
01:59:39.530 --> 01:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
really share some of your concerns about
 
01:59:41.810 --> 01:59:41.820 align:start position:0%
um people being over medicated having
 
01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
multiple medications
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
especially children
 
01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:47.870 align:start position:0%
especially children
um

01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:50.810 --> 01:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
I don't know of any evidence to say that
 
01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:51.410 align:start position:0%
I don't know of any evidence to say that
um

01:59:51.410 --> 01:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:54.050 --> 01:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
that has been done more
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
over Telehealth than in in-person visits
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
in fact you know my experiences with a
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
lot of people a lot of children and
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
adults who have mental health issues
 
02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
who've been put on
 
02:00:08.689 --> 02:00:08.699 align:start position:0%
a myriad medications
 
02:00:08.699 --> 02:00:09.709 align:start position:0%
a myriad medications
um

02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
through in-person visits so I'm not
 
02:00:14.570 --> 02:00:14.580 align:start position:0%
really sure how the issue of Telehealth
 
02:00:17.689 --> 02:00:17.699 align:start position:0%
or not Telehealth is related to those
 
02:00:20.209 --> 02:00:20.219 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you very much for your
 
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
your concern
 
02:00:24.890 --> 02:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
um and you know there was and I I have
 
02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
it in the handout that the the CDC does
 
02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
report you know higher incidence of
 
02:00:31.310 --> 02:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
suicide during this period where we've
 
02:00:33.229 --> 02:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
used in Telehealth you know is there
 
02:00:35.629 --> 02:00:35.639 align:start position:0%
something exactly points to Telehealth
 
02:00:35.639 --> 02:00:37.010 align:start position:0%
something exactly points to Telehealth
itself

02:00:37.010 --> 02:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
itself
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
um as being you know the pivotal change
 
02:00:40.970 --> 02:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
here you know we've got this nurse who
 
02:00:43.729 --> 02:00:43.739 align:start position:0%
who killed her children you know on 13
 
02:00:46.129 --> 02:00:46.139 align:start position:0%
different psychotropic drugs I I think
 
02:00:49.010 --> 02:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
it's it's very clear that we we would
 
02:00:52.070 --> 02:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
want more monitoring of children not
 
02:00:54.290 --> 02:00:54.300 align:start position:0%
less in spite of the fact if we haven't
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
done studies yet it just makes sense
 
02:00:58.370 --> 02:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
they need to be carefully monitored in
 
02:00:59.930 --> 02:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
person thank you
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
02:01:04.669 --> 02:01:04.679 align:start position:0%
representative Palazzo
 
02:01:07.070 --> 02:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Chan thank you for taking
 
02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
my question can you a little bit uh
 
02:01:13.729 --> 02:01:13.739 align:start position:0%
expand on monitoring and on benefits of
 
02:01:13.739 --> 02:01:15.189 align:start position:0%
expand on monitoring and on benefits of
in-person

02:01:15.189 --> 02:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
in-person
 
02:01:18.850 --> 02:01:18.860 align:start position:0%
monitoring versus uh uh
 
02:01:22.189 --> 02:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
telemedicine monitoring maybe there are
 
02:01:25.370 --> 02:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
some situations when telemedicine would
 
02:01:29.330 --> 02:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
be better if if the doctor can spend
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
more time chatting with a client or or
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
do you think that certain side effects
 
02:01:38.350 --> 02:01:38.360 align:start position:0%
from medication
 
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
and certain mental health conditions
 
02:01:43.450 --> 02:01:43.460 align:start position:0%
could be
 
02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
detected only in in person visits thank
 
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative I I think
 
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
if I understand your question
 
02:01:54.229 --> 02:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
um you know what are the the benefits of
 
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
of in-person you know versus Telehealth
 
02:01:58.850 --> 02:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
and when I first looked at Telehealth I
 
02:02:00.530 --> 02:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
thought well it's a zoom meeting right
 
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
so the doctor actually gets to see them
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
if you look at the definition of
 
02:02:05.450 --> 02:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
Telehealth you know it doesn't have to
 
02:02:07.370 --> 02:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
be and in testimony I was on the Senate
 
02:02:09.410 --> 02:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
side you know it could be an email it
 
02:02:11.450 --> 02:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
could be a text message so there's
 
02:02:14.089 --> 02:02:14.099 align:start position:0%
there's no visual contact
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
um with the patient necessarily via
 
02:02:18.770 --> 02:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
Telehealth and we all know we've done
 
02:02:19.850 --> 02:02:19.860 align:start position:0%
the zoom
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
um and even with zoom we all know that
 
02:02:24.410 --> 02:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
there's something really different about
 
02:02:26.810 --> 02:02:26.820 align:start position:0%
sizing up a person
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
um and and to evaluate you know how
 
02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
they're doing when you actually get to
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
see them in person you know is this
 
02:02:35.149 --> 02:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
child looking really tired are they
 
02:02:37.010 --> 02:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
disheveled or they actually believe in
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
to get to the appointment
 
02:02:41.209 --> 02:02:41.219 align:start position:0%
um you know is there life in chaos and
 
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
those things I think you know you get
 
02:02:45.649 --> 02:02:45.659 align:start position:0%
better sense of those when you see
 
02:02:48.410 --> 02:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
someone in person you know is it the
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
parent pushing for this you know to try
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
to control their child just a lot of
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
information can be gathered from those
 
02:02:56.689 --> 02:02:56.699 align:start position:0%
in-person visits to protect children
 
02:02:58.609 --> 02:02:58.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:01.129 --> 02:03:01.139 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
 
02:03:01.139 --> 02:03:02.390 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
farmer

02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
farmer
 
02:03:05.149 --> 02:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
I guess my concern would be this
 
02:03:07.310 --> 02:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
um during the
 
02:03:10.490 --> 02:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
during covid and during bad weather the
 
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
choice often is a visit or no visit not
 
02:03:17.930 --> 02:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
Telehealth versus an in-person visit so
 
02:03:21.229 --> 02:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
I I you know I I guess I would just
 
02:03:25.129 --> 02:03:25.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't a Telehealth be visit
 
02:03:30.169 --> 02:03:30.179 align:start position:0%
Telehealth visit be better than no visit
 
02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
at all
 
02:03:34.850 --> 02:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
um I I think if there's a crisis
 
02:03:34.860 --> 02:03:36.770 align:start position:0%
um I I think if there's a crisis
situation

02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:03:39.470 --> 02:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
um that an in-person visit you know
 
02:03:41.450 --> 02:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
absolutely is required I don't think if
 
02:03:43.609 --> 02:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
a person's in crisis and just because
 
02:03:46.129 --> 02:03:46.139 align:start position:0%
there's a snowstorm that you can add a a
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
drug so I'm sorry did I misunderstand
 
02:03:49.970 --> 02:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
your question well I'm just my my
 
02:03:52.490 --> 02:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
question is really if the choice is
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
an in-person visit I mean a Telehealth
 
02:03:57.290 --> 02:03:57.300 align:start position:0%
visit or no visit not necessarily a
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
crisis situation we're talking with this
 
02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
this it's getting a prescription done so
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
the person is going to run out of their
 
02:04:06.169 --> 02:04:06.179 align:start position:0%
medication they can't get for the to
 
02:04:08.450 --> 02:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
their in-person visit
 
02:04:11.390 --> 02:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
isn't the Telehealth better than
 
02:04:13.129 --> 02:04:13.139 align:start position:0%
thank you I think I better understand
 
02:04:15.050 --> 02:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
your question and you'll see in the the
 
02:04:17.450 --> 02:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
amendment that I proposed is that a
 
02:04:20.510 --> 02:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
refill of existing prescriptions
 
02:04:22.850 --> 02:04:22.860 align:start position:0%
um would not require an in-person visit
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
so if it's you know that sort of routine
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
thing but I think we owe children to
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
protection if you're increasing dosage
 
02:04:31.790 --> 02:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
decreasing dosages adding additional
 
02:04:34.250 --> 02:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
drugs the drugs aren't working those
 
02:04:35.689 --> 02:04:35.699 align:start position:0%
sort of things require an in-person
 
02:04:38.209 --> 02:04:38.219 align:start position:0%
visit but yes some situations and that's
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
why I put that in there simple refill
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
you know shouldn't necessarily acquire
 
02:04:45.050 --> 02:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
an in-person visit thank you
 
02:04:48.410 --> 02:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:50.750 --> 02:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
say no other questions thank you thank
 
02:04:56.089 --> 02:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:58.010 --> 02:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
hey also signed up to speak is James
 
02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
Monahan from New Hampshire Community
 
02:05:04.490 --> 02:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:08.270 --> 02:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:10.129 --> 02:05:10.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my name is Jim
 
02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
Monahan with the DuPont group and I'm
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
here today on behalf of the
 
02:05:15.290 --> 02:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
um the community Behavioral Health
 
02:05:17.330 --> 02:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
Association the state's 10 Community
 
02:05:18.970 --> 02:05:18.980 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
I can think
 
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
only take two minutes because I want to
 
02:05:26.629 --> 02:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
focus mainly on two things I agree with
 
02:05:28.850 --> 02:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
um with Matt hood that Senate Bill 500
 
02:05:31.609 --> 02:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
does everything and more the 238 does
 
02:05:34.189 --> 02:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
and should Senate Bill 500 be enacted
 
02:05:36.890 --> 02:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
there's probably not a need for 238
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
um and thanks to the hard work of this
 
02:05:40.970 --> 02:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
committee to address the issue in a more
 
02:05:43.010 --> 02:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
comprehensive way rather than an issue
 
02:05:44.570 --> 02:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
by issue way
 
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
um I am concerned as I'm sure the
 
02:05:49.250 --> 02:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
committee is because you took the time
 
02:05:51.410 --> 02:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
to change the effective date on 500 that
 
02:05:53.149 --> 02:05:53.159 align:start position:0%
we're running up close to the deadlines
 
02:05:56.689 --> 02:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
on on the public health emergency I
 
02:05:58.490 --> 02:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
think there's a senator in the room so
 
02:06:01.010 --> 02:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
I'll be careful but that that delay is
 
02:06:03.050 --> 02:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
very much you know in somewhat in the
 
02:06:04.729 --> 02:06:04.739 align:start position:0%
hands of the Senate to try to address
 
02:06:06.290 --> 02:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
that now and so anything that this
 
02:06:07.729 --> 02:06:07.739 align:start position:0%
committee can do to move that along I
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
think would be helpful
 
02:06:12.530 --> 02:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
um you know Senate Bill 238 was proposed
 
02:06:13.790 --> 02:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
to the Senate Health and Human Service
 
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
committee on February 15th uh that the
 
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
senate had the hearing they amended the
 
02:06:20.330 --> 02:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
effective date and passed it on the same
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
day it was on a good cost to get taken
 
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
care of in a timely fashion but it did
 
02:06:26.570 --> 02:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
get hung up in the Senate on some of the
 
02:06:30.189 --> 02:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
issues associated with Senate Bill 253
 
02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
which is crossed over I think that's now
 
02:06:35.030 --> 02:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the possession of the children family
 
02:06:37.010 --> 02:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
law committee that's probably a better
 
02:06:39.589 --> 02:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
place to deal with a lot of these very
 
02:06:42.550 --> 02:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate questions around parental
 
02:06:45.290 --> 02:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
consent and access to records and so
 
02:06:47.810 --> 02:06:47.820 align:start position:0%
it's been a little frustrating that this
 
02:06:50.330 --> 02:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
bill and this topic has been hung up on
 
02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
that you don't don't have any control of
 
02:06:54.350 --> 02:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
that so
 
02:06:57.410 --> 02:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
um I would hope that uh should you
 
02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
proceed you're certainly going to take
 
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
into account that you that Senate Bill
 
02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
500 addresses that we'll be working in
 
02:07:04.870 --> 02:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate to try to get that bill
 
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
out of committee on the senate floor
 
02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
to the house for concurrence and to the
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
governor all by May 11th which won't be
 
02:07:13.970 --> 02:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
easy but we'll try very hard and we may
 
02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
be back to ask for help on that so I'll
 
02:07:17.870 --> 02:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
talk more about process than the bill
 
02:07:19.129 --> 02:07:19.139 align:start position:0%
but if you have any questions on the
 
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm happy to do what I can

02:28:24.830 --> 02:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
this is the prescription buyback this is

used medications or no longer prescribe
 
02:28:34.130 --> 02:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
medications or medications left over

from patients who have been discharged

or died
 
02:28:40.429 --> 02:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
in healthcare facilities like nursing
 
02:28:44.270 --> 02:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
homes so we can stop using the yucky goo
 
02:28:47.389 --> 02:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
that creates mold and it's a really
 
02:28:49.910 --> 02:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
nasty way of getting rid of these meds
 
02:28:52.190 --> 02:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
and this is just a nice clean way we can
 
02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
give them back to the pharmacy
 
02:28:57.530 --> 02:28:57.540 align:start position:0%

uh representative Merchant um thank you
 
02:29:07.610 --> 02:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
recently the um
 
02:29:11.210 --> 02:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
DEA has now required that pharmacies not
 
02:29:13.070 --> 02:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
saying that to support the bill but just
 
02:29:14.389 --> 02:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
to give people an update on what's
 
02:29:16.730 --> 02:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
happening on controlled drugs anytime an
 
02:29:18.650 --> 02:29:18.660 align:start position:0%
opiate is dispensed by your Pharmacy is
 
02:29:20.210 --> 02:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
required to actually give the patient or
 
02:29:22.490 --> 02:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
the caregiver something to dispose of
 
02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
medication so it goes back into trying
 
02:29:26.889 --> 02:29:26.899 align:start position:0%
to broaden the issue of
 
02:29:29.450 --> 02:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
ability to dispose of controlled drugs
 
02:29:30.889 --> 02:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
to keep them out of the supply chain
 
02:29:34.030 --> 02:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
pick up the patients so I support it
 
02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:35.760 align:start position:0%

for the most part this all already
 
02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%

02:32:13.130 --> 02:32:13.140 align:start position:0%
meet reality
 
02:32:18.170 --> 02:32:18.180 align:start position:0%

02:34:05.460 --> 02:34:34.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:34:34.030 --> 02:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:36.349 --> 02:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
does everyone have the amendment it's
 
02:34:38.450 --> 02:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
almost all around it's working it's way
 
02:34:44.110 --> 02:34:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:47.030 --> 02:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
make a motion to approve the amendment
 
02:34:50.270 --> 02:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
to move it you move uh Amendment one
 
02:34:52.910 --> 02:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
three five two h
 
02:34:55.130 --> 02:34:55.140 align:start position:0%
uh to pass I assume ought to pass thank
 
02:34:57.889 --> 02:34:57.899 align:start position:0%
you is there a second
 
02:35:00.650 --> 02:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
uh representative Leon seconds
 
02:35:02.090 --> 02:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant would you like
 
02:35:04.130 --> 02:35:04.140 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion yes
 
02:35:06.710 --> 02:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
the reason for the amendment is the fact
 
02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:07.610 align:start position:0%
the reason for the amendment is the fact
that

02:35:07.610 --> 02:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:10.370 --> 02:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
when we looked at the bill initially it
 
02:35:12.110 --> 02:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
says the commission may authorize the
 
02:35:12.120 --> 02:35:13.490 align:start position:0%
says the commission may authorize the
program

02:35:13.490 --> 02:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:35:14.929 --> 02:35:14.939 align:start position:0%
and I speaking to the Department of
 
02:35:18.710 --> 02:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
Health Human Services my concern was
 
02:35:20.690 --> 02:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
within the department
 
02:35:23.270 --> 02:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
is accountability if you leave it open
 
02:35:26.090 --> 02:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
to a program you really a program a
 
02:35:28.969 --> 02:35:28.979 align:start position:0%
program cannot sign a document
 
02:35:31.969 --> 02:35:31.979 align:start position:0%
a person can so at that point in time
 
02:35:33.110 --> 02:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about release of
 
02:35:35.150 --> 02:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
information I want to be sure that there
 
02:35:37.309 --> 02:35:37.319 align:start position:0%
was some traceability back to a person
 
02:35:39.710 --> 02:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
who has the authority by granted to them
 
02:35:42.130 --> 02:35:42.140 align:start position:0%
by the commissioner so something
 
02:35:44.510 --> 02:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
inadvertently goes wrong we can go back
 
02:35:47.030 --> 02:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
to that individual and saying You
 
02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
released the authorization you had the
 
02:35:49.969 --> 02:35:49.979 align:start position:0%
authorization to release the information
 
02:35:52.490 --> 02:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
but you shouldn't have authorized it so
 
02:35:54.170 --> 02:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
I wanted to be clear to the department
 
02:35:57.410 --> 02:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
that we have traceability and
 
02:35:57.420 --> 02:35:58.550 align:start position:0%
that we have traceability and
accountability

02:35:58.550 --> 02:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
02:36:00.830 --> 02:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
to an individual somebody that we can
 
02:36:02.690 --> 02:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
trace to being authorized by the
 
02:36:02.700 --> 02:36:03.950 align:start position:0%
trace to being authorized by the
commissioner

02:36:03.950 --> 02:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:36:05.450 --> 02:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
that was the only reason for making the
 
02:36:06.770 --> 02:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
changes in the department I worked with
 
02:36:08.990 --> 02:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
them in collaboration and they support
 
02:36:10.429 --> 02:36:10.439 align:start position:0%

02:39:24.530 --> 02:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:39:27.469 --> 02:39:27.479 align:start position:0%
um I I appreciate the motivation behind
 
02:39:31.429 --> 02:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
this study committee however I I do have
 
02:39:33.290 --> 02:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
some concerns about adding yet another
 
02:39:35.870 --> 02:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
study committee when we're looking at
 
02:39:37.969 --> 02:39:37.979 align:start position:0%
talking about insurance coverage which
 
02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
is outside of the scope of this
 
02:39:41.929 --> 02:39:41.939 align:start position:0%
committee I believe that this is
 
02:39:44.389 --> 02:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
something that can adequately be dealt
 
02:39:46.130 --> 02:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
with in discussions and ad hoc
 
02:39:48.530 --> 02:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
committees and therefore this is
 
02:39:48.540 --> 02:39:51.290 align:start position:0%
committees and therefore this is
unnecessary

02:39:51.290 --> 02:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:55.969 --> 02:39:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:58.010 --> 02:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
um I hate to disagree with my colleague
 
02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
having been on a couple of study
 
02:40:03.469 --> 02:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
committees one of which was the study of
 
02:40:03.479 --> 02:40:04.630 align:start position:0%
committees one of which was the study of
Aces

02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
Aces
 
02:40:07.969 --> 02:40:07.979 align:start position:0%
which I thought was so incredibly Broad
 
02:40:10.490 --> 02:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
and brought so many people to testify
 
02:40:14.150 --> 02:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
who were interested and um that this
 
02:40:16.070 --> 02:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
that this particular issue that was
 
02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
brought to us is so narrow that it
 
02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:20.270 align:start position:0%
brought to us is so narrow that it
actually

02:40:20.270 --> 02:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:40:22.490 --> 02:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
at least given my experience is perfect
 
02:40:24.830 --> 02:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
for a study committee because it's a
 
02:40:27.349 --> 02:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
very narrow question that can bring
 
02:40:29.630 --> 02:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
limited number of people together and
 
02:40:35.450 --> 02:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:38.330 --> 02:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
solution or recommendations for
 
02:40:38.340 --> 02:40:39.530 align:start position:0%
solution or recommendations for
Solutions

02:40:39.530 --> 02:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
Solutions
 
02:40:39.540 --> 02:40:41.929 align:start position:0%
Solutions
so

02:40:41.929 --> 02:40:41.939 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:40:44.870 --> 02:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
I agree that there's um you know the the
 
02:40:47.150 --> 02:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
issue of there being a lot of committees
 
02:40:49.130 --> 02:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
and difficulty appointing people to them
 
02:40:50.990 --> 02:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
is an issue but I just thought that this
 
02:40:53.450 --> 02:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
was kind of the perfect
 
02:40:53.460 --> 02:40:55.309 align:start position:0%
was kind of the perfect
um

02:40:55.309 --> 02:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:58.010 --> 02:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
this was the perfect committee
 
02:41:01.070 --> 02:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
02:41:03.889 --> 02:41:03.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I agree with
 
02:41:05.990 --> 02:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro and I will just
 
02:41:08.570 --> 02:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
add that um
 
02:41:11.090 --> 02:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
these organizations of the organizations
 
02:41:14.389 --> 02:41:14.399 align:start position:0%
that provide services to our most
 
02:41:16.190 --> 02:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children
 
02:41:18.830 --> 02:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
but if they cannot
 
02:41:22.190 --> 02:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
find affordable insurance which was the
 
02:41:25.070 --> 02:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
underlying problem they will either stop
 
02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
being available and we already know we
 
02:41:29.150 --> 02:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
have a shortage of people available to
 
02:41:32.750 --> 02:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
do this kind of work or the price will
 
02:41:35.389 --> 02:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
go up and we know who's paying the price
 
02:41:38.809 --> 02:41:38.819 align:start position:0%
tag for that so on behalf of our
 
02:41:41.090 --> 02:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and our children I'm I'm going
 
02:41:44.570 --> 02:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
to vote against the itl representative
 
02:41:47.090 --> 02:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
Nagel and then representative
 
02:41:47.100 --> 02:41:47.750 align:start position:0%
Nagel and then representative
um

02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:50.349 --> 02:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
I agree with everything you said
 
02:41:52.730 --> 02:41:52.740 align:start position:0%
superficially when I saw this bill I
 
02:41:55.070 --> 02:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
wrote why and huge letters on front of
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
it and I I um you know everything that
 
02:42:00.469 --> 02:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
the good representative here and I have
 
02:42:02.090 --> 02:42:02.100 align:start position:0%
ever done was all done on an ad hoc
 
02:42:04.130 --> 02:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
basis and I think we got a lot of great
 
02:42:05.690 --> 02:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
stuff done that way
 
02:42:08.030 --> 02:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
the problem that the one gentleman that
 
02:42:10.490 --> 02:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
testified was we tried to do it and they
 
02:42:13.070 --> 02:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't listen to us and that was the
 
02:42:14.630 --> 02:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
only reason why the bill was brought
 
02:42:16.849 --> 02:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
forward if he hadn't said that so if
 
02:42:19.010 --> 02:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
there's an alternative way to you know
 
02:42:21.650 --> 02:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
put a fire under people's backsides to
 
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
bring them together to discuss it I
 
02:42:25.130 --> 02:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
agree with everything you just said but
 
02:42:27.650 --> 02:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
he's saying that that's not the case so
 
02:42:33.349 --> 02:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:35.090 --> 02:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
when I read this bill I didn't quite get
 
02:42:37.309 --> 02:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
it and when the gentleman who testified
 
02:42:39.309 --> 02:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
said it wasn't about
 
02:42:41.750 --> 02:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
ensuring the children it wasn't the
 
02:42:43.429 --> 02:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
children's insurance it was all the
 
02:42:46.849 --> 02:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
agencies that work with highly volatile
 
02:42:46.859 --> 02:42:48.050 align:start position:0%
agencies that work with highly volatile
and

02:42:48.050 --> 02:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:42:50.389 --> 02:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
children that they're not able to get
 
02:42:52.730 --> 02:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
insurances so you know Nashua children's
 
02:42:54.889 --> 02:42:54.899 align:start position:0%
home I'm making that up I don't he
 
02:42:58.370 --> 02:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
didn't list the organizations Waypoint
 
02:43:01.969 --> 02:43:01.979 align:start position:0%
so if they can't get in insurance they
 
02:43:04.610 --> 02:43:04.620 align:start position:0%
can't treat any of these children at any
 
02:43:07.550 --> 02:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
of these children so the state of New
 
02:43:09.590 --> 02:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be way out of luck with
 
02:43:11.929 --> 02:43:11.939 align:start position:0%
what to do with these children and so
 
02:43:13.969 --> 02:43:13.979 align:start position:0%
the gentleman who testified I'm sorry I
 
02:43:16.490 --> 02:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
can't remember his name he wanted the
 
02:43:18.530 --> 02:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
weight of the legislature
 
02:43:20.809 --> 02:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
to help with
 
02:43:23.030 --> 02:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
figuring getting all the
 
02:43:25.370 --> 02:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
what do we call them shareholders in
 
02:43:27.469 --> 02:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
place so that we could have a serious
 
02:43:29.510 --> 02:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
conversation and figure out a solution
 
02:43:31.790 --> 02:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
to this so
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
um I I know we have too many study
 
02:43:36.950 --> 02:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
committees and I'll volunteer to serve
 
02:43:39.530 --> 02:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
on this one as I do with something that
 
02:43:42.830 --> 02:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
I am passionate about this ultimately
 
02:43:44.990 --> 02:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
comes into being and the speaker they
 
02:43:46.429 --> 02:43:46.439 align:start position:0%
asked me to make a recommendation I'll
 
02:43:50.150 --> 02:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
remember that I absolutely and you know
 
02:43:52.849 --> 02:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
I've I've been stuck before so I've
 
02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
served on the guys on either side of you
 
02:43:59.889 --> 02:43:59.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:01.849 --> 02:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant although that
 
02:44:04.250 --> 02:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
didn't work out sorry about that but
 
02:44:05.809 --> 02:44:05.819 align:start position:0%
representative Lane I think maybe you
 
02:44:07.429 --> 02:44:07.439 align:start position:0%
weren't here for that
 
02:44:08.630 --> 02:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
um testimony
 
02:44:12.590 --> 02:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
and it was compelling so I I'm I'm if I
 
02:44:14.770 --> 02:44:14.780 align:start position:0%
could vote twice for this I would
 
02:44:16.849 --> 02:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
02:44:19.309 --> 02:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:44:22.250 --> 02:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
I've worked on several ad hoc committees
 
02:44:24.469 --> 02:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
and I think the real
 
02:44:26.389 --> 02:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
time things have worked through an ad
 
02:44:27.889 --> 02:44:27.899 align:start position:0%
hoc committee is when all the
 
02:44:29.690 --> 02:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are there because they want
 
02:44:31.790 --> 02:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
to be there and they want to do
 
02:44:33.410 --> 02:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
something and take some sort of action
 
02:44:35.450 --> 02:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
what I heard
 
02:44:35.460 --> 02:44:37.250 align:start position:0%
what I heard
representative

02:44:37.250 --> 02:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:44:40.250 --> 02:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
talked about it they've tried that and
 
02:44:41.510 --> 02:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's not working
 
02:44:43.130 --> 02:44:43.140 align:start position:0%
so I'm not really a strong supporter
 
02:44:45.110 --> 02:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions and so forth
 
02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
we have enough to begin with but I think
 
02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:48.230 align:start position:0%
we have enough to begin with but I think
sometimes

02:44:48.230 --> 02:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
02:44:49.849 --> 02:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
perhaps a Sparrow's Point of View this
 
02:44:52.190 --> 02:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
is narrow it's very specific and I think
 
02:44:53.750 --> 02:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's a way to bring the stakeholders
 
02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:54.650 align:start position:0%
it's a way to bring the stakeholders
together

02:44:54.650 --> 02:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:44:56.210 --> 02:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:44:58.849 --> 02:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
power if you will of this body
 
02:45:00.770 --> 02:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
about the importance of it to get
 
02:45:02.330 --> 02:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
something accomplished because I think
 
02:45:04.849 --> 02:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
ultimately it comes down to being able
 
02:45:06.770 --> 02:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
to care for the children and if they
 
02:45:07.969 --> 02:45:07.979 align:start position:0%
can't get the insurance we're going to
 
02:45:09.290 --> 02:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
disrupt it so therefore I would vote
 
02:45:11.990 --> 02:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
against the itl and vote ultimately to
 
02:45:13.550 --> 02:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
pass it
 
02:45:15.170 --> 02:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
representative Missouri and then
 
02:45:15.180 --> 02:45:16.309 align:start position:0%
representative Missouri and then
representative

02:45:16.309 --> 02:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:45:16.319 --> 02:45:18.130 align:start position:0%
representative
um

02:45:18.130 --> 02:45:18.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:21.849 --> 02:45:21.859 align:start position:0%
I have in my notes um from that hearing
 
02:45:24.530 --> 02:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
specifically a question was asked about
 
02:45:26.630 --> 02:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
a committee Sunset date
 
02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:28.309 align:start position:0%
a committee Sunset date
that

02:45:28.309 --> 02:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:30.830 --> 02:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe there was ever or
 
02:45:33.349 --> 02:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
we'd have never resolved that so if
 
02:45:35.630 --> 02:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
anyone's heard anything about that
 
02:45:37.550 --> 02:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead sure um thank you I actually
 
02:45:40.070 --> 02:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
reached out to OLS earlier today and
 
02:45:43.610 --> 02:45:43.620 align:start position:0%
because this is this is chapter law not
 
02:45:45.950 --> 02:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
statutory law it automatically dissolves
 
02:45:48.710 --> 02:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
after the report is filed so we don't
 
02:45:50.450 --> 02:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
need to have a sunset provision on that
 
02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:56.270 --> 02:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Cushman thank you
 
02:45:57.530 --> 02:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
02:45:59.990 --> 02:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going to support my
 
02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:01.010 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going to support my
colleague

02:46:01.010 --> 02:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
colleague
 
02:46:03.590 --> 02:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
um our vice chair on her motion
 
02:46:06.290 --> 02:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
um I think I I do feel for the
 
02:46:07.550 --> 02:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
um organizations who are having trouble
 
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
with the insurance but I think that they
 
02:46:11.210 --> 02:46:11.220 align:start position:0%
would do well to work directly with
 
02:46:13.550 --> 02:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
Representatives who are willing
 
02:46:16.010 --> 02:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
um to help them on some specific
 
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
legislation and if some stakeholders
 
02:46:22.309 --> 02:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
um do not want to participate the ones
 
02:46:23.570 --> 02:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
that they've been trying to participate
 
02:46:23.580 --> 02:46:24.710 align:start position:0%
that they've been trying to participate
with

02:46:24.710 --> 02:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:46:27.469 --> 02:46:27.479 align:start position:0%
um who wouldn't entertain it then they
 
02:46:29.510 --> 02:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
would miss out on the Drafting and the
 
02:46:32.330 --> 02:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
crafting of that legislation and we
 
02:46:33.710 --> 02:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
really need to reduce study committees
 
02:46:35.630 --> 02:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
have already voted for several this term
 
02:46:38.450 --> 02:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
and I typically have a rule that I I
 
02:46:40.309 --> 02:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to create study committees um
 
02:46:42.650 --> 02:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
so I will be voting against
 
02:46:44.870 --> 02:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
02:46:47.450 --> 02:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman while I wasn't
 
02:46:49.910 --> 02:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
here in person uh it was a very nice
 
02:46:52.010 --> 02:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
break to watch our footage from our
 
02:46:54.410 --> 02:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
hearings to interrupt why I was out of
 
02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
town so I was able to watch and observe
 
02:46:58.790 --> 02:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I found with my
 
02:47:01.370 --> 02:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
limited but with my experience in the
 
02:47:04.190 --> 02:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
house is that we have study committees
 
02:47:06.170 --> 02:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
and they also can't compel anybody to
 
02:47:08.030 --> 02:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
come and testify so while they do have a
 
02:47:08.990 --> 02:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more weight of the
 
02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
legislature they still rely on people's
 
02:47:15.650 --> 02:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
cooperation and I've found that odd ad
 
02:47:18.230 --> 02:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
hoc committees often end up coming in
 
02:47:20.090 --> 02:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
with more buy-in than study committee
 
02:47:22.670 --> 02:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
results as well so while I appreciate
 
02:47:25.130 --> 02:47:25.140 align:start position:0%
that this could add some heft I know
 
02:47:27.110 --> 02:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
that I've seen very very solid very
 
02:47:29.630 --> 02:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
strong efforts come if I'm an ad hoc
 
02:47:32.389 --> 02:47:32.399 align:start position:0%
basis and I I don't think
 
02:47:35.030 --> 02:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
I I don't I don't I appreciate their
 
02:47:36.710 --> 02:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
concerns and their challenges but I
 
02:47:37.849 --> 02:47:37.859 align:start position:0%
don't know that this would actually
 
02:47:39.530 --> 02:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
solve that problem
 
02:47:41.750 --> 02:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
02:47:43.270 --> 02:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
I will just
 
02:47:47.270 --> 02:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
refer back to the history of this issue
 
02:47:52.150 --> 02:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
and the fact that I think we have
 
02:47:54.710 --> 02:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
somebody has put in a bill to address
 
02:47:57.710 --> 02:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
this problem I think twice before
 
02:47:57.720 --> 02:47:58.969 align:start position:0%
this problem I think twice before
already

02:47:58.969 --> 02:47:58.979 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:48:01.849 --> 02:48:01.859 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's a limited liability
 
02:48:04.670 --> 02:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
Bill and sometimes it's an insurance
 
02:48:09.170 --> 02:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
bill but the fact is that we have
 
02:48:11.750 --> 02:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
tensions between
 
02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:14.150 align:start position:0%
tensions between
uh

02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:48:17.090 --> 02:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
the cost of insurance on the one hand
 
02:48:19.910 --> 02:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
the desirability of the services that
 
02:48:21.590 --> 02:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
are being provided
 
02:48:25.550 --> 02:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
and some of the solutions which have
 
02:48:28.730 --> 02:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
been to limit liability which then
 
02:48:31.849 --> 02:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
leaves some people without a remedy so
 
02:48:35.469 --> 02:48:35.479 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders are not just
 
02:48:40.790 --> 02:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
DHHS and these care providers it also
 
02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
involves things like The Trial Lawyers
 
02:48:47.450 --> 02:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
Association and we people have been
 
02:48:51.250 --> 02:48:51.260 align:start position:0%
working on this for some time now
 
02:48:55.910 --> 02:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
without a result and so just saying that
 
02:48:57.410 --> 02:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
we're going to do that again and hope it
 
02:49:00.770 --> 02:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
works doesn't work for me which is why I
 
02:49:03.349 --> 02:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
I but I share all the concerns that have
 
02:49:05.450 --> 02:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
been expressed about study committees I
 
02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
I do
 
02:49:10.010 --> 02:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
truly believe that but I've also I think
 
02:49:12.290 --> 02:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
this one is is one that's Worthy
 
02:49:15.170 --> 02:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro I just I just
 
02:49:16.849 --> 02:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
want to make the point that I you know
 
02:49:19.309 --> 02:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
in regards to this debate it's really
 
02:49:19.319 --> 02:49:20.929 align:start position:0%
in regards to this debate it's really
about

02:49:20.929 --> 02:49:20.939 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:49:23.270 --> 02:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
um whether a study committee process
 
02:49:25.849 --> 02:49:25.859 align:start position:0%
would work or an ad hoc
 
02:49:25.859 --> 02:49:27.410 align:start position:0%
would work or an ad hoc
um

02:49:27.410 --> 02:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:30.830 --> 02:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
get together would work and and uh I
 
02:49:32.330 --> 02:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
just want to make it clear that I think
 
02:49:34.670 --> 02:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
nobody's accusing the other side of this
 
02:49:37.070 --> 02:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
debate of not caring about kids or not
 
02:49:39.469 --> 02:49:39.479 align:start position:0%
caring about those agencies being able
 
02:49:41.990 --> 02:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
to take care of kids and
 
02:49:44.030 --> 02:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I think we're all on the same side
 
02:49:47.570 --> 02:49:47.580 align:start position:0%
that this is an issue that would
 
02:49:49.610 --> 02:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
that would be really important for us
 
02:49:53.210 --> 02:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
all to solve both from you know a
 
02:49:56.030 --> 02:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
financial point of view but also from
 
02:49:59.450 --> 02:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
the point of view of taking giving kids
 
02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
the best care
 
02:50:04.370 --> 02:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
um so none of us know which way it will
 
02:50:06.469 --> 02:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
get solved or if it'll get solved but I
 
02:50:06.479 --> 02:50:07.190 align:start position:0%
get solved or if it'll get solved but I
think

02:50:07.190 --> 02:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:50:11.570 --> 02:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to vote against the itl but
 
02:50:14.090 --> 02:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and I just had one
 
02:50:16.250 --> 02:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
further uh point that I wanted to make
 
02:50:18.650 --> 02:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been made before
 
02:50:21.410 --> 02:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
um this also it's not a huge committee
 
02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a huge commission it's two
 
02:50:25.969 --> 02:50:25.979 align:start position:0%
members of the house and we already have
 
02:50:27.530 --> 02:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
one person who said they wanted to work
 
02:50:30.110 --> 02:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
on it and one member of the Senate so
 
02:50:35.030 --> 02:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a huge use of legislative
 
02:50:37.429 --> 02:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
resources thank you representative
 
02:50:40.250 --> 02:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
profile did you end up I did thank you
 
02:50:42.290 --> 02:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so
 
02:50:42.300 --> 02:50:43.309 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so
um

02:50:43.309 --> 02:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:45.349 --> 02:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
having just started work on the
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
committee on commissions I am acutely
 
02:50:49.429 --> 02:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
02:50:52.730 --> 02:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
um whoops the number of study committees
 
02:50:55.070 --> 02:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
and commissions that and this I think
 
02:50:57.230 --> 02:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
this is at least the third rendition of
 
02:50:59.270 --> 02:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
the committee on Commissions in the past
 
02:51:01.550 --> 02:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
two decades so
 
02:51:01.560 --> 02:51:02.510 align:start position:0%
two decades so
um

02:51:02.510 --> 02:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:06.110 --> 02:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
you know I I guess my concern is
 
02:51:08.210 --> 02:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
expanding the number of committees and
 
02:51:10.370 --> 02:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
commissions in this case study committee
 
02:51:13.670 --> 02:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
but also the effectiveness of that group
 
02:51:16.070 --> 02:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the likelihood that that that the
 
02:51:18.050 --> 02:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
recommendations coming back from that
 
02:51:20.750 --> 02:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
group will be implemented there is an
 
02:51:22.370 --> 02:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
alternative that I would like to just
 
02:51:25.849 --> 02:51:25.859 align:start position:0%
put on the table for your consideration
 
02:51:27.469 --> 02:51:27.479 align:start position:0%
which is that
 
02:51:29.510 --> 02:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
it is within the purview my
 
02:51:30.770 --> 02:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it is within the
 
02:51:33.290 --> 02:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
purview of standing committees to
 
02:51:34.730 --> 02:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
address these kinds of issues and
 
02:51:36.670 --> 02:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
whether that be
 
02:51:39.349 --> 02:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
sort of an ad hoc working group going
 
02:51:41.630 --> 02:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
off and and sort of doing some leg work
 
02:51:41.640 --> 02:51:43.210 align:start position:0%
off and and sort of doing some leg work
or

02:51:43.210 --> 02:51:43.220 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:51:46.190 --> 02:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
formally or and then formally
 
02:51:49.690 --> 02:51:49.700 align:start position:0%
undertaking work as a standing committee
 
02:51:53.809 --> 02:51:53.819 align:start position:0%
or just starting it as the standing
 
02:51:55.670 --> 02:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
committee you know bringing stakeholders
 
02:52:00.110 --> 02:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
in to examine this more closely I in
 
02:52:02.929 --> 02:52:02.939 align:start position:0%
terms of Effectiveness I do believe that
 
02:52:05.330 --> 02:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
if we had that level of participation
 
02:52:07.190 --> 02:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
which is to say this entire committee
 
02:52:11.030 --> 02:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
participating in that process we would
 
02:52:13.790 --> 02:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
stand a much higher chance of actually
 
02:52:16.010 --> 02:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
implementing the recommendations coming
 
02:52:17.990 --> 02:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
out of that committee that is this
 
02:52:20.929 --> 02:52:20.939 align:start position:0%
committee so I I'm going to vote against
 
02:52:22.670 --> 02:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote in favor of the itl
 
02:52:25.309 --> 02:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
motion but I wanted to offer that as an
 
02:52:25.319 --> 02:52:27.230 align:start position:0%
motion but I wanted to offer that as an
alternative

02:52:27.230 --> 02:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
02:52:29.450 --> 02:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel I know I'm not
 
02:52:31.250 --> 02:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
supposed to ask this question but what
 
02:52:33.889 --> 02:52:33.899 align:start position:0%
did the Senate vote on this
 
02:52:35.870 --> 02:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
I'll put it for it to have made here
 
02:52:37.730 --> 02:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
made it here obviously I'm just curious
 
02:52:39.290 --> 02:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
it was closer I don't know what the vote
 
02:52:39.300 --> 02:52:42.790 align:start position:0%
it was closer I don't know what the vote
was

02:52:42.790 --> 02:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
when I was yes I was looking all the
 
02:52:48.170 --> 02:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
bills up and they voted
 
02:52:50.269 --> 02:52:50.279 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with an amendment by vote
 
02:52:51.830 --> 02:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
of five nothing
 
02:52:53.870 --> 02:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
that would be the committee you know
 
02:52:56.269 --> 02:52:56.279 align:start position:0%
it's like can I get a clarification from
 
02:52:58.429 --> 02:52:58.439 align:start position:0%
representative coalfault about what he's
 
02:53:00.230 --> 02:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
suggesting I'm not sure I understand
 
02:53:03.710 --> 02:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
what he's suggesting is an alternative
 
02:53:05.750 --> 02:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead and what I'm suggesting is an
 
02:53:08.389 --> 02:53:08.399 align:start position:0%
alternative is that this committee
 
02:53:11.570 --> 02:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
take on the the work that is outlined in
 
02:53:13.910 --> 02:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:16.190 --> 02:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
and and and the the specifics of how
 
02:53:18.769 --> 02:53:18.779 align:start position:0%
that looks could could vary it could be
 
02:53:21.230 --> 02:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
that we meet as a committee
 
02:53:23.450 --> 02:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
and invite stakeholders in
 
02:53:25.750 --> 02:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
or it could be that we
 
02:53:29.030 --> 02:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
delegate to a working group
 
02:53:32.290 --> 02:53:32.300 align:start position:0%
in preparation for this committee
 
02:53:35.570 --> 02:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
you know holding more formal hearings in
 
02:53:37.670 --> 02:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
in a in in that context
 
02:53:41.150 --> 02:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:43.490 --> 02:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
and I would say I I have seen that
 
02:53:46.670 --> 02:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
process work the question is what we're
 
02:53:48.530 --> 02:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve here
 
02:53:52.130 --> 02:53:52.140 align:start position:0%
uh having served on a previous iteration
 
02:53:54.349 --> 02:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
of the committee on commissions or
 
02:53:57.170 --> 02:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
committee on committees uh one of the
 
02:53:59.750 --> 02:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
things we did was we made the rule that
 
02:54:03.130 --> 02:54:03.140 align:start position:0%
chapter law will expire at the end of
 
02:54:06.969 --> 02:54:06.979 align:start position:0%
the term that we're all sitting in so
 
02:54:09.889 --> 02:54:09.899 align:start position:0%
this this is not going to proliferate
 
02:54:11.450 --> 02:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
it's not going to hang around doing
 
02:54:13.910 --> 02:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
nothing it's not going to be an ongoing
 
02:54:17.630 --> 02:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
issue that's item number one number two
 
02:54:21.290 --> 02:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
if you are concerned about the use of
 
02:54:23.870 --> 02:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
the resources of this body
 
02:54:27.469 --> 02:54:27.479 align:start position:0%
this uses three people
 
02:54:27.479 --> 02:54:29.990 align:start position:0%
this uses three people
and

02:54:29.990 --> 02:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:35.870 --> 02:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
I have a hard time getting behind
 
02:54:37.790 --> 02:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
the use of
 
02:54:40.690 --> 02:54:40.700 align:start position:0%
20 people
 
02:54:45.050 --> 02:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
when a smaller number could do the leg
 
02:54:48.650 --> 02:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
work so I guess what I'm saying is I
 
02:54:51.230 --> 02:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
would prefer to pass this study
 
02:54:54.950 --> 02:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
committee but if it is not passed my
 
02:54:56.870 --> 02:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
preference would be for the chair to
 
02:55:01.630 --> 02:55:01.640 align:start position:0%
appoint a small ad hoc working group
 
02:55:04.910 --> 02:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
which is then an official committee it
 
02:55:08.150 --> 02:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
has to notice its hearings so it's not
 
02:55:10.929 --> 02:55:10.939 align:start position:0%
just people who
 
02:55:13.570 --> 02:55:13.580 align:start position:0%
self-select who they're talking to
 
02:55:15.710 --> 02:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
obviously there's some stakeholders who
 
02:55:17.450 --> 02:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
may choose not to come but then as
 
02:55:19.250 --> 02:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
representative Leon says they don't get
 
02:55:23.150 --> 02:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
included and and that's on them but
 
02:55:25.809 --> 02:55:25.819 align:start position:0%
a small ad hoc committee would have to
 
02:55:29.330 --> 02:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
do its work under the provisions of the
 
02:55:31.309 --> 02:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
right to no law and therefore would have
 
02:55:35.050 --> 02:55:35.060 align:start position:0%
anybody who has an interest would be
 
02:55:37.429 --> 02:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
unnoticed and able to come I mean they
 
02:55:38.809 --> 02:55:38.819 align:start position:0%
can come anyway but that way they know
 
02:55:41.389 --> 02:55:41.399 align:start position:0%
about it so that would be my second
 
02:55:44.269 --> 02:55:44.279 align:start position:0%
preference would be to have a very small
 
02:55:47.330 --> 02:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
ad hoc committee that is named by the
 
02:55:49.130 --> 02:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
chairman and therefore a subcommittee of
 
02:55:50.870 --> 02:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
this committee okay thank you
 
02:55:52.250 --> 02:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
representative Leon and then
 
02:55:53.450 --> 02:55:53.460 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and then
 
02:55:55.670 --> 02:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
02:55:57.170 --> 02:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
chairman there's definitely been some
 
02:55:58.969 --> 02:55:58.979 align:start position:0%
really good and important points here
 
02:56:01.730 --> 02:56:01.740 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if it would make sense for
 
02:56:03.710 --> 02:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
us to retain this so that we can do that
 
02:56:06.710 --> 02:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
ad hoc and by doing that and having it
 
02:56:09.290 --> 02:56:09.300 align:start position:0%
based on our disposition at the end if
 
02:56:10.910 --> 02:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
our ad hoc committee comes up with
 
02:56:12.830 --> 02:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
something we could have a hearing on
 
02:56:14.929 --> 02:56:14.939 align:start position:0%
that non-germaine amendment in order to
 
02:56:16.730 --> 02:56:16.740 align:start position:0%
get that into the January session so
 
02:56:19.670 --> 02:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
that we can if we can find progress on
 
02:56:21.349 --> 02:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
this and if we can make something happen
 
02:56:23.450 --> 02:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
with that ad hoc group we don't have to
 
02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
wait as long this would actually
 
02:56:27.290 --> 02:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
accelerate it beyond the time frame of
 
02:56:29.210 --> 02:56:29.220 align:start position:0%
that study committee because it seems
 
02:56:30.950 --> 02:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
like we all understand the need for this
 
02:56:32.570 --> 02:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
and we just simply haven't been able to
 
02:56:36.349 --> 02:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
get from A to Z yet and perhaps this
 
02:56:38.510 --> 02:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
will give us that opportunity
 
02:56:40.910 --> 02:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you
 
02:56:42.889 --> 02:56:42.899 align:start position:0%
so I'll be clear I understand this
 
02:56:44.630 --> 02:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
correctly um representative Weber and
 
02:56:47.990 --> 02:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
also representative Cobalt and Leon
 
02:56:50.690 --> 02:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't per se be an ad hoc it'd
 
02:56:52.790 --> 02:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
be actually an official subcommittee of
 
02:56:55.910 --> 02:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
this committee so if we retain the bill
 
02:56:58.309 --> 02:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
and the chair elects to create a
 
02:56:59.809 --> 02:56:59.819 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which then has to go
 
02:57:02.570 --> 02:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
through public noticing in 91a we're
 
02:57:05.330 --> 02:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
still in essence creating a legislative
 
02:57:07.070 --> 02:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
body that's going to pull the
 
02:57:08.929 --> 02:57:08.939 align:start position:0%
stakeholders together is that how I
 
02:57:10.010 --> 02:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
02:57:10.020 --> 02:57:11.170 align:start position:0%
understand it
yep

02:57:11.170 --> 02:57:11.180 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:57:13.250 --> 02:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
02:57:15.530 --> 02:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so although we have actually
 
02:57:17.389 --> 02:57:17.399 align:start position:0%
generally referred to those committees
 
02:57:19.070 --> 02:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
as ad hoc committees which may be the
 
02:57:22.389 --> 02:57:22.399 align:start position:0%
wrong term for it but I chaired one once
 
02:57:24.590 --> 02:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I would say I think that this
 
02:57:26.389 --> 02:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
actually makes
 
02:57:30.429 --> 02:57:30.439 align:start position:0%
really good sense in in the sense that
 
02:57:33.950 --> 02:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
we can get some people going I think the
 
02:57:37.429 --> 02:57:37.439 align:start position:0%
one issue with the ad hoc committee is
 
02:57:41.210 --> 02:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
that it might be very useful to have
 
02:57:44.570 --> 02:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
somebody from Commerce on it and I'm not
 
02:57:47.330 --> 02:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
sure we can do that but I suppose they
 
02:57:49.070 --> 02:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
could have their arm twisted up behind
 
02:57:52.130 --> 02:57:52.140 align:start position:0%
their backs or something I I would have
 
02:57:53.750 --> 02:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
to ask the clerk if it can be an
 
02:57:56.269 --> 02:57:56.279 align:start position:0%
intercommittee thing I know that you can
 
02:57:59.030 --> 02:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
appoint some as as a subcommittee of
 
02:58:01.010 --> 02:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
this committee but the speaker would
 
02:58:03.290 --> 02:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
have to do that right away from another
 
02:58:06.790 --> 02:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
committee I I'm I'm just not sure
 
02:58:09.830 --> 02:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
whether we have the ability to do it
 
02:58:12.950 --> 02:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
across committees or not and and
 
02:58:12.960 --> 02:58:13.730 align:start position:0%
across committees or not and and
um

02:58:13.730 --> 02:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:17.389 --> 02:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:18.950 --> 02:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
I just don't know
 
02:58:21.469 --> 02:58:21.479 align:start position:0%
so representative a merchant and then
 
02:58:23.269 --> 02:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative nadarapam
 
02:58:27.650 --> 02:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:30.170 --> 02:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
I I was really gonna say something
 
02:58:33.230 --> 02:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
similar which is uh I I'm agreeable to
 
02:58:35.090 --> 02:58:35.100 align:start position:0%
this solution it doesn't seem that
 
02:58:35.100 --> 02:58:36.290 align:start position:0%
this solution it doesn't seem that
different

02:58:36.290 --> 02:58:36.300 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:58:38.269 --> 02:58:38.279 align:start position:0%
um but that we that this committee
 
02:58:40.190 --> 02:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have all the areas
 
02:58:43.610 --> 02:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
of expertise that is called for to solve
 
02:58:45.469 --> 02:58:45.479 align:start position:0%
this problem so I think
 
02:58:47.929 --> 02:58:47.939 align:start position:0%
uh you know either voluntarily
 
02:58:49.849 --> 02:58:49.859 align:start position:0%
participating or being officially
 
02:58:52.389 --> 02:58:52.399 align:start position:0%
appointed to this subcommittee I think
 
02:58:55.610 --> 02:58:55.620 align:start position:0%
we need people from
 
02:58:57.889 --> 02:58:57.899 align:start position:0%
for more well-equipped to deal with
 
02:58:59.929 --> 02:58:59.939 align:start position:0%
insurance issues
 
02:58:59.939 --> 02:59:02.630 align:start position:0%
insurance issues
representative

02:59:02.630 --> 02:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:59:04.790 --> 02:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
I was just going to say we can always
 
02:59:06.590 --> 02:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
invite someone from another committee
 
02:59:08.570 --> 02:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
whether they're officially appointed or
 
02:59:08.580 --> 02:59:09.530 align:start position:0%
whether they're officially appointed or
not

02:59:09.530 --> 02:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:59:11.269 --> 02:59:11.279 align:start position:0%
can't we
 
02:59:13.250 --> 02:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
02:59:13.260 --> 02:59:14.570 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
um

02:59:14.570 --> 02:59:14.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:17.090 --> 02:59:17.100 align:start position:0%
the reason I like ad hoc committees is
 
02:59:19.070 --> 02:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:59:21.710 --> 02:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
we're all equals and I I think that has
 
02:59:23.389 --> 02:59:23.399 align:start position:0%
a huge amount of value but the other
 
02:59:25.490 --> 02:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
thing we do too is we reach out to
 
02:59:28.130 --> 02:59:28.140 align:start position:0%
everybody to make sure they're there and
 
02:59:30.050 --> 02:59:30.060 align:start position:0%
I think that if we're I like this
 
02:59:31.790 --> 02:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
approach the best I think is a great
 
02:59:34.370 --> 02:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
idea but my my big concern is that we
 
02:59:36.469 --> 02:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
really need to make an effort to reach
 
02:59:38.570 --> 02:59:38.580 align:start position:0%
out not to say here's a notice and hope
 
02:59:40.849 --> 02:59:40.859 align:start position:0%
you come type thing because I know
 
02:59:43.010 --> 02:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
I've seen some really bad legislation
 
02:59:45.170 --> 02:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
passed because certain people don't show
 
02:59:46.910 --> 02:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
up partially because they didn't know
 
02:59:48.650 --> 02:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
about it or whatever but I think we do
 
02:59:50.750 --> 02:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
need to make that effort and that's
 
02:59:52.790 --> 02:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
my only concern
 
02:59:55.190 --> 02:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:59:55.200 --> 02:59:59.469 align:start position:0%
thank you
Steve

02:59:59.469 --> 02:59:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:03.889 --> 03:00:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:06.230 --> 03:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh we just found out that we cannot put
 
03:00:08.030 --> 03:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
some from someone from Commerce on the
 
03:00:08.040 --> 03:00:09.530 align:start position:0%
some from someone from Commerce on the
committee

03:00:09.530 --> 03:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:00:12.230 --> 03:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
um we've checked with the clerk's office
 
03:00:14.750 --> 03:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
have to send that off so thank you thank
 
03:00:16.730 --> 03:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
you Christina
 
03:00:18.950 --> 03:00:18.960 align:start position:0%

representative Leon um I'd like to
 
03:00:25.790 --> 03:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
withdraw my motion
 
03:00:27.950 --> 03:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
um in order to make another one okay and
 
03:00:30.110 --> 03:00:30.120 align:start position:0%

03:00:37.429 --> 03:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
oh yes okay representative Leon um I

would like to move that we retain
 
03:00:42.110 --> 03:00:42.120 align:start position:0%

seconds yes okay

Hampshire Council on developmental
 
03:02:19.550 --> 03:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities do I have a motion
 
03:02:22.070 --> 03:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a motion that we ought
 
03:02:23.269 --> 03:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
03:02:27.070 --> 03:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
this bill okay is there a second second
 
03:02:29.510 --> 03:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weber seconds
 
03:02:31.370 --> 03:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
representative King do you wish to speak
 
03:02:33.290 --> 03:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
to your motion
 
03:02:35.870 --> 03:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll be short it's this is
 
03:02:38.750 --> 03:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
essentially a short bill that just um it
 
03:02:41.510 --> 03:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
adds in uh it subtracts not more than
 
03:02:45.230 --> 03:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
and adds in at least 21 members and if I
 
03:02:47.330 --> 03:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
remember right representative Weber
 
03:02:51.349 --> 03:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
calculated that they needed 22.5
 
03:02:55.190 --> 03:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
um and it also removes the language of
 
03:02:58.550 --> 03:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh vacancies shall be filled by the
 
03:03:00.710 --> 03:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
unexp expired terms so this is pretty
 
03:03:03.950 --> 03:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
straightforward Bill and um so I ask
 
03:03:07.010 --> 03:03:07.020 align:start position:0%

seeing none
 
03:03:16.070 --> 03:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the clerk is ready I will ask him to
 
03:03:17.690 --> 03:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
call the wall
 
03:03:19.490 --> 03:03:19.500 align:start position:0%

speak to your Merchant
 
03:04:48.230 --> 03:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
um this is my commission uh committee
 
03:04:51.170 --> 03:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
commission whatever it is Council
 
03:04:53.630 --> 03:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
um so I've been on this very short
 
03:04:55.790 --> 03:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
period of time but one of the reasons I
 
03:04:57.769 --> 03:04:57.779 align:start position:0%
actually ran for office was to get on
 
03:04:59.870 --> 03:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
this commission I think it has
 
03:05:01.910 --> 03:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
an incredible amount of value but what
 
03:05:03.830 --> 03:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
was really needed our last hearing which
 
03:05:05.929 --> 03:05:05.939 align:start position:0%
I'm still having incontinence over
 
03:05:08.090 --> 03:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
because I actually had to chair the
 
03:05:11.030 --> 03:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
meeting which I'd never done before
 
03:05:13.190 --> 03:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
um but they were very nice and we got
 
03:05:14.750 --> 03:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
through it but what the point of the
 
03:05:17.210 --> 03:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
meeting was was to bring together a lot
 
03:05:19.309 --> 03:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
of relevant governmental organizations
 
03:05:22.730 --> 03:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
together to solve a problem together and
 
03:05:24.769 --> 03:05:24.779 align:start position:0%
that's partially what this bill does the
 
03:05:26.330 --> 03:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
other thing is it just adds a lot of
 
03:05:29.090 --> 03:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
information on how we can do that the
 
03:05:31.269 --> 03:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
best we can there's going to be roughly
 
03:05:34.370 --> 03:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
300 million dollars that needs to get
 
03:05:36.830 --> 03:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
dispersed to important organizations
 
03:05:40.429 --> 03:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
within the state and for us as a group
 
03:05:42.170 --> 03:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
to do that by ourselves would be really
 
03:05:42.180 --> 03:05:43.370 align:start position:0%
to do that by ourselves would be really
challenging

03:05:43.370 --> 03:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
challenging
 
03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that's really
 
03:05:47.150 --> 03:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
important is getting this money out as
 
03:05:49.849 --> 03:05:49.859 align:start position:0%
fast as possible and the way it's
 
03:05:51.710 --> 03:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
structured right now that's not going to
 
03:05:53.990 --> 03:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
happen so there's a lot of organizations
 
03:05:56.269 --> 03:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
that need this money to do their their
 
03:05:59.389 --> 03:05:59.399 align:start position:0%
job to facilitate everything we talked
 
03:06:01.969 --> 03:06:01.979 align:start position:0%
about earlier today prevention treatment
 
03:06:04.490 --> 03:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
harm reduction on and on and on there's
 
03:06:06.790 --> 03:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
about 10 different
 
03:06:08.929 --> 03:06:08.939 align:start position:0%
categories of things that we're going to
 
03:06:10.969 --> 03:06:10.979 align:start position:0%
be looking at there's 17 actually in
 
03:06:13.790 --> 03:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
statute right now so it's a start it's
 
03:06:15.830 --> 03:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
not a finish but it's an important bill
 
03:06:19.250 --> 03:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
and I would beg you to please vote
 
03:06:21.349 --> 03:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
03:06:23.630 --> 03:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representative Leon
 
03:06:26.990 --> 03:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and um this is
 
03:06:29.269 --> 03:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely a very important bill the
 
03:06:31.370 --> 03:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
discussion earlier today did raise one
 
03:06:33.349 --> 03:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
question in my mind what is harm
 
03:06:35.030 --> 03:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
reduction and should that be defined in
 
03:06:37.190 --> 03:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
our statutes I'm wondering if people
 
03:06:39.110 --> 03:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
would be amenable to just pausing this
 
03:06:40.610 --> 03:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
until next week and seeing about
 
03:06:42.469 --> 03:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
potentially adding a definition of harm
 
03:06:44.510 --> 03:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
reduction because I don't want the
 
03:06:46.730 --> 03:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
equivalent of sunscreen to be using up
 
03:06:48.230 --> 03:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
valuable dollars that should be paying
 
03:06:50.750 --> 03:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
for things like syringe exchange and um
 
03:06:53.630 --> 03:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
and dory's programs and all of those
 
03:06:56.030 --> 03:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
the answer yeah yeah representative
 
03:06:56.040 --> 03:06:57.530 align:start position:0%
the answer yeah yeah representative
Daigle

03:06:57.530 --> 03:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
Daigle
 
03:06:57.540 --> 03:06:58.490 align:start position:0%
Daigle
um

03:06:58.490 --> 03:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:00.889 --> 03:07:00.899 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate I didn't bring all of
 
03:07:02.570 --> 03:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
our materials because
 
03:07:04.130 --> 03:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
um in the governor's
 
03:07:04.140 --> 03:07:04.730 align:start position:0%
um in the governor's
um

03:07:04.730 --> 03:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:07.370 --> 03:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
information on their I'm sorry I'm
 
03:07:09.530 --> 03:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
getting all my nomenclature mixed up as
 
03:07:11.090 --> 03:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
to what's a task force and what's that
 
03:07:13.190 --> 03:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
and the other thing but anyways there's
 
03:07:15.530 --> 03:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
a a long description of what harm
 
03:07:17.269 --> 03:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
reduction is and I have absolutely no
 
03:07:19.790 --> 03:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
problem with tableing it and I can share
 
03:07:21.530 --> 03:07:21.540 align:start position:0%
that with everybody here and you can see
 
03:07:23.570 --> 03:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
what it says
 
03:07:23.580 --> 03:07:24.889 align:start position:0%
what it says
um

03:07:24.889 --> 03:07:24.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:29.870 --> 03:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:32.030 --> 03:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
I would also say that
 
03:07:34.910 --> 03:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I've got the wrong bill in
 
03:07:37.550 --> 03:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
front of me I beg your pardon but
 
03:07:43.370 --> 03:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:51.290 --> 03:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:52.910 --> 03:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
if there's somebody else who wants to
 
03:07:54.830 --> 03:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
speak take them and I'll I'll look if
 
03:07:55.910 --> 03:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
you want anyone else representative
 
03:07:55.920 --> 03:07:57.230 align:start position:0%
you want anyone else representative
Plaza

03:07:57.230 --> 03:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
Plaza
 
03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh I I want to confirm what the previous
 
03:08:04.370 --> 03:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
speakers uh said that I think it's an
 
03:08:06.650 --> 03:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
important bill in right direction but uh
 
03:08:10.550 --> 03:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
I think we need uh to take steps to make
 
03:08:13.389 --> 03:08:13.399 align:start position:0%
sure that funds are appropriated
 
03:08:16.670 --> 03:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
appropriately where they needed so I'm
 
03:08:19.429 --> 03:08:19.439 align:start position:0%
not ready for to vote for it today but
 
03:08:21.290 --> 03:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
so you would prefer to see it pushed off
 
03:08:23.330 --> 03:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
till next week yeah yeah yes can I
 
03:08:25.370 --> 03:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
respond to that
 
03:08:28.550 --> 03:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
is that the pleasure of the body
 
03:08:31.910 --> 03:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
seems to be well representative wanted
 
03:08:33.410 --> 03:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
to respond representative Nagel I'm
 
03:08:36.889 --> 03:08:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:39.469 --> 03:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
the process by which all these different
 
03:08:41.690 --> 03:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
organizations are vetted is is
 
03:08:44.150 --> 03:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
unbelievable and now that what this
 
03:08:46.130 --> 03:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
would add actually is another level that
 
03:08:49.250 --> 03:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
anything that we go we we approve has to
 
03:08:51.170 --> 03:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
not only be approved by the opioid
 
03:08:52.849 --> 03:08:52.859 align:start position:0%
abatement commission but it also needs
 
03:08:54.290 --> 03:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
to go through the governor's commission
 
03:08:56.030 --> 03:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
as well
 
03:08:58.490 --> 03:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
um there's some of the smartest people
 
03:09:00.469 --> 03:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
on the state working in these two
 
03:09:03.290 --> 03:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
organizations and I I understand that
 
03:09:05.030 --> 03:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
concern up to a point but that that
 
03:09:07.070 --> 03:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
issue was raised right from the very
 
03:09:08.690 --> 03:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
beginning when this commission was
 
03:09:11.510 --> 03:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
started one of the reasons I wanted to
 
03:09:13.250 --> 03:09:13.260 align:start position:0%
be on the commission is my people are
 
03:09:16.070 --> 03:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
neglected and I wanted to be part of it
 
03:09:18.170 --> 03:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they were included so
 
03:09:20.990 --> 03:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
but I would be if you want I'd be happy
 
03:09:22.730 --> 03:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
to share the information on how this
 
03:09:25.910 --> 03:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
commission Works how it was created what
 
03:09:27.889 --> 03:09:27.899 align:start position:0%
all the steps that it needs to go
 
03:09:31.190 --> 03:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
through to have a program be approved
 
03:09:32.870 --> 03:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
um you know where the money comes from
 
03:09:34.730 --> 03:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
where it goes it's a totally separate
 
03:09:37.010 --> 03:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
amount of money it's not coming out of
 
03:09:38.990 --> 03:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
the general fund it's not coming out of
 
03:09:43.190 --> 03:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:44.690 --> 03:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
I don't know if they go a plate where to
 
03:09:46.790 --> 03:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
call the money from you know lawsuits
 
03:09:48.410 --> 03:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
from pharmaceutical companies and it
 
03:09:50.750 --> 03:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
will be about 330 million dollars and
 
03:09:53.330 --> 03:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
that money has got to go to somewhere in
 
03:09:55.309 --> 03:09:55.319 align:start position:0%
a reasonable time frame
 
03:09:57.769 --> 03:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
okay I mean would you be amenable if
 
03:10:00.110 --> 03:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm fine with waiting a week
 
03:10:02.150 --> 03:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
the more knowledge is power I mean I'll
 
03:10:04.790 --> 03:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
be honest when I to get ready for our
 
03:10:06.290 --> 03:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
last meeting I read through all this
 
03:10:08.750 --> 03:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
stuff I was really amazed and I think
 
03:10:10.910 --> 03:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
you should see it because it's germane
 
03:10:13.550 --> 03:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
to everything we do here I mean it
 
03:10:16.190 --> 03:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't just about drug abuse and things
 
03:10:17.570 --> 03:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
like that it was about the mental health
 
03:10:19.309 --> 03:10:19.319 align:start position:0%
the 10-year mental health plan it was
 
03:10:22.250 --> 03:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
about the 10-year opioid plan it was
 
03:10:24.710 --> 03:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
really impressive and I think if you all
 
03:10:27.110 --> 03:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
saw it it'll help us do our job better
 
03:10:28.849 --> 03:10:28.859 align:start position:0%
going forward because I think most of us
 
03:10:31.190 --> 03:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
don't even know about these things
 
03:10:32.690 --> 03:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think it's Unique to this
 
03:10:33.769 --> 03:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
bill as to everything we do
 
03:10:34.969 --> 03:10:34.979 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant then
 
03:10:36.110 --> 03:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro and then
 
03:10:37.670 --> 03:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
03:10:40.309 --> 03:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:10:43.010 --> 03:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
I support this for several reasons a lot
 
03:10:45.769 --> 03:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
of things that we've talked about it
 
03:10:47.570 --> 03:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
does provide a clear guideline to how
 
03:10:49.849 --> 03:10:49.859 align:start position:0%
the funds get distributed and dispersed
 
03:10:52.429 --> 03:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
but also remember it's not just what the
 
03:10:53.870 --> 03:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
legislative body wants to put on
 
03:10:56.150 --> 03:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
constraints there is I'm sure within the
 
03:10:57.650 --> 03:10:57.660 align:start position:0%
settlement agreements
 
03:10:59.510 --> 03:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
constraints within those agreements and
 
03:11:01.429 --> 03:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
how the funds can be utilized so
 
03:11:02.929 --> 03:11:02.939 align:start position:0%
regardless of what this legislative body
 
03:11:05.269 --> 03:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
wants to do the real constraint is going
 
03:11:07.370 --> 03:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
to be what's in those contracts that
 
03:11:08.870 --> 03:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
were signed between the parties and how
 
03:11:11.030 --> 03:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
the funds can be utilized so therefore
 
03:11:12.590 --> 03:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sure within those constraints
 
03:11:14.630 --> 03:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's a limitation to what they can
 
03:11:17.929 --> 03:11:17.939 align:start position:0%
and cannot be used for if you will so I
 
03:11:20.330 --> 03:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
think trying to micromanage it at this
 
03:11:21.590 --> 03:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
point in time Beyond what's already
 
03:11:23.450 --> 03:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
there in those contracts which I'm sure
 
03:11:25.309 --> 03:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
were fully vetted
 
03:11:26.210 --> 03:11:26.220 align:start position:0%
um I don't think there's a reason to
 
03:11:27.650 --> 03:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
hold that up
 
03:11:30.950 --> 03:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:33.769 --> 03:11:33.779 align:start position:0%
I I'm ready to vote for it now but I'm
 
03:11:35.870 --> 03:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
I'm also okay with
 
03:11:38.750 --> 03:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
um voting on it next week but I think we
 
03:11:40.670 --> 03:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
have to clarify that if we're going to
 
03:11:42.110 --> 03:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
do that it's because someone's going to
 
03:11:44.210 --> 03:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
bring in a specific Amendment not that
 
03:11:46.190 --> 03:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
we're just going to get more information
 
03:11:46.200 --> 03:11:46.969 align:start position:0%
we're just going to get more information
um

03:11:46.969 --> 03:11:46.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:49.969 --> 03:11:49.979 align:start position:0%
with a definition of harm reduction
 
03:11:51.769 --> 03:11:51.779 align:start position:0%
which I think was
 
03:11:51.779 --> 03:11:53.630 align:start position:0%
which I think was
um

03:11:53.630 --> 03:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:55.550 --> 03:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
I think there were several of them given
 
03:11:57.410 --> 03:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
earlier but I think we shouldn't have
 
03:11:59.210 --> 03:11:59.220 align:start position:0%
too much trouble doing that thank you
 
03:12:01.070 --> 03:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
03:12:03.230 --> 03:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you Ola for allowing
 
03:12:05.030 --> 03:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
me the time to rummage through my papers
 
03:12:08.030 --> 03:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
I do think that the issue of a
 
03:12:09.950 --> 03:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
definition of harm reduction is very
 
03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
relevant to the role we heard earlier
 
03:12:14.630 --> 03:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
today but I don't think it's relevant to
 
03:12:15.710 --> 03:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
this one
 
03:12:17.809 --> 03:12:17.819 align:start position:0%
partially because of what we've heard
 
03:12:19.370 --> 03:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
from everybody about the way everything
 
03:12:22.190 --> 03:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
is set up but we need to also remember
 
03:12:24.830 --> 03:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
that although it says that the
 
03:12:26.809 --> 03:12:26.819 align:start position:0%
commission is going to award grants and
 
03:12:29.090 --> 03:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
revolving loan funds and matching funds
 
03:12:32.210 --> 03:12:32.220 align:start position:0%
It also says that all disbursements or
 
03:12:34.490 --> 03:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
grants shall require approval of the
 
03:12:37.370 --> 03:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
governor and executive Council so for
 
03:12:40.010 --> 03:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
people who are rightly concerned about
 
03:12:40.020 --> 03:12:42.070 align:start position:0%
people who are rightly concerned about
uh

03:12:42.070 --> 03:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:12:44.870 --> 03:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
who is dispersing the funds and whether
 
03:12:46.790 --> 03:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
they are duly elected and whether they
 
03:12:51.309 --> 03:12:51.319 align:start position:0%
answer to the General Public
 
03:12:54.790 --> 03:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
these all require two levels of
 
03:13:00.290 --> 03:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
involvement already and given the
 
03:13:03.590 --> 03:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
very extensive statutory scheme that
 
03:13:05.690 --> 03:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
already exists
 
03:13:09.610 --> 03:13:09.620 align:start position:0%
I would be hard put
 
03:13:09.620 --> 03:13:11.150 align:start position:0%
I would be hard put
to

03:13:11.150 --> 03:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:13:11.160 --> 03:13:12.070 align:start position:0%
to
um

03:13:12.070 --> 03:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:15.950 --> 03:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
vote for a specific definition of harm
 
03:13:18.290 --> 03:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
reduction which I think then muddies the
 
03:13:23.030 --> 03:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:25.490 --> 03:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
aside from whether I agree with the
 
03:13:27.290 --> 03:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
actual definition that people come up
 
03:13:28.550 --> 03:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
with which I think is going to be a
 
03:13:32.330 --> 03:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
sticking point so I I have no objection
 
03:13:34.010 --> 03:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
to putting it off for next week and
 
03:13:35.630 --> 03:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
letting people try if that will make
 
03:13:38.450 --> 03:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
people more comfortable but I'm
 
03:13:41.330 --> 03:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
certainly in much more inclined to vote
 
03:13:42.889 --> 03:13:42.899 align:start position:0%
for the bill as it is
 
03:13:45.410 --> 03:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Nagel
 
03:13:46.510 --> 03:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
um you actually
 
03:13:48.769 --> 03:13:48.779 align:start position:0%
simultaneously gave the solution and the
 
03:13:48.779 --> 03:13:50.210 align:start position:0%
simultaneously gave the solution and the
problem

03:13:50.210 --> 03:13:50.220 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:13:51.889 --> 03:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
um we've had
 
03:13:54.590 --> 03:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
um about I don't remember what dollar
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
figure number of Grants already approved
 
03:13:58.250 --> 03:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
that are sitting in the executive
 
03:14:00.349 --> 03:14:00.359 align:start position:0%
Council now waiting
 
03:14:03.650 --> 03:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
to be approved so the the time so it's a
 
03:14:05.570 --> 03:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
roadblock and it's and it's a solution
 
03:14:07.910 --> 03:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
at the same time but it's important and
 
03:14:10.849 --> 03:14:10.859 align:start position:0%
it is and it does exist so as far as
 
03:14:14.150 --> 03:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
harm reduction if I can also say that I
 
03:14:16.730 --> 03:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
mean I just got back from a meeting in
 
03:14:19.250 --> 03:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
Dallas I mean we could have sat for
 
03:14:21.530 --> 03:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
hours and days to talk about harm
 
03:14:22.969 --> 03:14:22.979 align:start position:0%
reduction I don't think we're going to
 
03:14:25.370 --> 03:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
come up with a solution to that Within
 
03:14:28.429 --> 03:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
the next week what I I mean now that
 
03:14:30.349 --> 03:14:30.359 align:start position:0%
we're creating new committees and ad hoc
 
03:14:32.090 --> 03:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
committees and things like that I mean
 
03:14:34.070 --> 03:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
at some level that's already being done
 
03:14:36.830 --> 03:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
but at the same time it's something for
 
03:14:38.990 --> 03:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
us to maybe think about because some of
 
03:14:40.670 --> 03:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
these committees that testified before
 
03:14:42.349 --> 03:14:42.359 align:start position:0%
us are already talking about those
 
03:14:43.910 --> 03:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
things so I'm sure they have data
 
03:14:46.250 --> 03:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
information about it but I I don't think
 
03:14:47.690 --> 03:14:47.700 align:start position:0%
we're going to solve that issue in a
 
03:14:47.700 --> 03:14:49.849 align:start position:0%
we're going to solve that issue in a
week

03:14:49.849 --> 03:14:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:53.450 --> 03:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you um I
 
03:14:56.870 --> 03:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
was just looking at at the bill and
 
03:15:00.230 --> 03:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
it is possible that we could pass this
 
03:15:02.330 --> 03:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
today and then I meant bring an
 
03:15:04.550 --> 03:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
03:15:06.469 --> 03:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
um the bill we heard earlier today
 
03:15:08.870 --> 03:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
because they're in the same section and
 
03:15:10.370 --> 03:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
we could Define it there and it would
 
03:15:16.130 --> 03:15:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:16.140 --> 03:15:17.929 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:15:17.929 --> 03:15:17.939 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:15:20.330 --> 03:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
other discussion
 
03:15:21.769 --> 03:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
because the question is do we want to
 
03:15:23.150 --> 03:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
move forward we have a motion on the
 
03:15:25.429 --> 03:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
floor right now we're about to pass do
 
03:15:28.250 --> 03:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
we want to proceed with that motion or
 
03:15:30.170 --> 03:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
03:15:32.690 --> 03:15:32.700 align:start position:0%
um thank you I I just would feel I I
 
03:15:35.090 --> 03:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
feel a little nervous about making it a
 
03:15:36.950 --> 03:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
very large blank check I know it's
 
03:15:39.410 --> 03:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
checked by the executive Council but I
 
03:15:40.910 --> 03:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
have this gut feeling where I'm just not
 
03:15:42.530 --> 03:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that if we can wait
 
03:15:44.510 --> 03:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
till next week I can see what language
 
03:15:46.670 --> 03:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
we're also doing then otherwise
 
03:15:48.530 --> 03:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
personally I'm going to need to vote
 
03:15:50.389 --> 03:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
against the ought to pass because I only
 
03:15:52.309 --> 03:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
want to support legislation I feel very
 
03:15:54.290 --> 03:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
comfortable supporting
 
03:15:56.510 --> 03:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
um I I'd prefer to be able to vote for
 
03:15:58.610 --> 03:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
it but I'll go with the will of the
 
03:15:58.620 --> 03:16:00.290 align:start position:0%
it but I'll go with the will of the
committee

03:16:00.290 --> 03:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:16:02.510 --> 03:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
03:16:04.849 --> 03:16:04.859 align:start position:0%
and I just want to make the point that
 
03:16:08.929 --> 03:16:08.939 align:start position:0%
this is already a much larger Bill than
 
03:16:11.389 --> 03:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
harm reduction I mean it's already a
 
03:16:12.889 --> 03:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
much larger
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
fund and it then then harm reduction so
 
03:16:21.710 --> 03:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
that trying to micromanage one small
 
03:16:25.849 --> 03:16:25.859 align:start position:0%
piece of it with a definition
 
03:16:25.859 --> 03:16:27.130 align:start position:0%
piece of it with a definition
um

03:16:27.130 --> 03:16:27.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:30.650 --> 03:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
may make things considerably more
 
03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
difficult rather than less
 
03:16:35.870 --> 03:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel there's actually 17
 
03:16:39.110 --> 03:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
different elements to this in statute
 
03:16:39.120 --> 03:16:40.250 align:start position:0%
different elements to this in statute
now

03:16:40.250 --> 03:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:16:44.150 --> 03:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
and that's only one of 17.
 
03:16:46.309 --> 03:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
another representative Leon
 
03:16:47.990 --> 03:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I guess it's a matter of whether it's
 
03:16:50.510 --> 03:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
my no today or a possible yes tomorrow
 
03:16:51.950 --> 03:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
I'll go with whatever all of you guys
 
03:16:55.910 --> 03:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:58.370 --> 03:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
well again we have a motion on the floor
 
03:16:58.380 --> 03:16:59.030 align:start position:0%
well again we have a motion on the floor
um

03:16:59.030 --> 03:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:01.910 --> 03:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
I guess Representative demago no in a
 
03:17:03.170 --> 03:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
way it starts with you you'd have to
 
03:17:05.469 --> 03:17:05.479 align:start position:0%
withdraw your motion
 
03:17:08.150 --> 03:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
so you you want the vote to go forward
 
03:17:08.160 --> 03:17:09.170 align:start position:0%
so you you want the vote to go forward
okay

03:17:09.170 --> 03:17:09.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:17:10.849 --> 03:17:10.859 align:start position:0%
all right so there's a motion on the
 
03:17:12.650 --> 03:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
floor about to pass on Senate Bill 32
 
03:17:15.769 --> 03:17:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:17.269 --> 03:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing none
 
03:17:20.030 --> 03:17:20.040 align:start position:0%

03:20:09.479 --> 03:20:30.130 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:20:30.130 --> 03:20:30.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:32.690 --> 03:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
and representative lay on seconds the
 
03:20:36.309 --> 03:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
emotion to about to pass on Amendment
 
03:20:39.050 --> 03:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
1413h representative Cushman do you wish
 
03:20:41.690 --> 03:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion yes thank you
 
03:20:44.269 --> 03:20:44.279 align:start position:0%
so as we expand authorization to
 
03:20:45.769 --> 03:20:45.779 align:start position:0%
administer more and more vaccines
 
03:20:47.929 --> 03:20:47.939 align:start position:0%
outside of medical settings first we
 
03:20:50.030 --> 03:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
started with pharmacies
 
03:20:52.610 --> 03:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
um optometrists soon possibly that's a
 
03:20:54.530 --> 03:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
medical setting but it's not a
 
03:20:56.809 --> 03:20:56.819 align:start position:0%
traditionally where you would expect to
 
03:20:59.809 --> 03:20:59.819 align:start position:0%
receive a vaccine we need to ensure that
 
03:21:01.969 --> 03:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
these other professionals that are that
 
03:21:05.809 --> 03:21:05.819 align:start position:0%
we're bringing in to do this are doing
 
03:21:08.030 --> 03:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
this safely and with proper training and
 
03:21:09.950 --> 03:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
properly follow-up especially when we're
 
03:21:11.510 --> 03:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
authorizing them to give vaccines that
 
03:21:13.370 --> 03:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
are very new
 
03:21:16.790 --> 03:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
um in 2021 rep Merchant and I uh worked
 
03:21:19.610 --> 03:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
together on the language in RSA 318
 
03:21:22.610 --> 03:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
colon 16b which is where
 
03:21:25.910 --> 03:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
um SB 35 is making changes and we agreed
 
03:21:27.950 --> 03:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
that if we were to authorize Pharmacy
 
03:21:29.450 --> 03:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
professionals to administer vaccines
 
03:21:31.490 --> 03:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
outside of medical settings there needed
 
03:21:34.190 --> 03:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
to be some safeguards in place so we
 
03:21:36.710 --> 03:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
required some technique on some training
 
03:21:38.389 --> 03:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
on recognizing and Reporting adverse
 
03:21:41.570 --> 03:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
reactions injection technique
 
03:21:44.690 --> 03:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
um and we also included a requirement to
 
03:21:49.309 --> 03:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
comply with RSA 141c colon 20f regarding
 
03:21:51.070 --> 03:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
the vaccine registry
 
03:21:53.990 --> 03:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's all well and good unfortunately
 
03:21:57.650 --> 03:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
we found out during testimony on HB 1606
 
03:22:00.349 --> 03:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
and 2022 that pharmacies were dropping
 
03:22:01.910 --> 03:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
the ball on informing patients that they
 
03:22:03.410 --> 03:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
had the right to opt out of the vaccine
 
03:22:05.630 --> 03:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
registry and they were sweeping the
 
03:22:07.550 --> 03:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
private medical information into that
 
03:22:11.030 --> 03:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
government system without consent so
 
03:22:13.010 --> 03:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
already we had some failure there on the
 
03:22:14.809 --> 03:22:14.819 align:start position:0%
part of these on the part of the
 
03:22:16.849 --> 03:22:16.859 align:start position:0%
implementation of this new authorization
 
03:22:19.429 --> 03:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
for pharmacy professionals and I don't
 
03:22:20.630 --> 03:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
mean any offense to Pharmacy
 
03:22:23.150 --> 03:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
professionals but the laws are
 
03:22:25.130 --> 03:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
especially federal laws they're written
 
03:22:27.530 --> 03:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
strongly in favor and support of vaccine
 
03:22:30.530 --> 03:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
manufacturers as I see it and off it
 
03:22:32.450 --> 03:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
often results in harm to the Privacy
 
03:22:33.950 --> 03:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
rights and even at times to the health
 
03:22:36.950 --> 03:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
of patients and so it was good that HP
 
03:22:40.910 --> 03:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
1606 passed and you know hopefully that
 
03:22:42.889 --> 03:22:42.899 align:start position:0%
issue with the registry is is solved
 
03:22:44.570 --> 03:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
however there Remains the issue of low
 
03:22:46.309 --> 03:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
reporting of Adverse Events following
 
03:22:48.290 --> 03:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
vaccination with this bill we're
 
03:22:49.849 --> 03:22:49.859 align:start position:0%
authorizing Pharmacy professionals to
 
03:22:51.410 --> 03:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
administer vaccines that aren't even on
 
03:22:53.630 --> 03:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
the market yet they're very new it's
 
03:22:55.429 --> 03:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
important for post-approval surveillance
 
03:22:57.710 --> 03:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
of new vaccines to have good data so
 
03:23:00.110 --> 03:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
safety signals can be caught early and
 
03:23:02.450 --> 03:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
dealt with and and prevent further harm
 
03:23:04.910 --> 03:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
and we do know we do that through the
 
03:23:06.230 --> 03:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
Bears the vaccine adverse event
 
03:23:08.330 --> 03:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
Reporting System it is not a perfect
 
03:23:10.849 --> 03:23:10.859 align:start position:0%
system but it's the only one we have and
 
03:23:12.110 --> 03:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things that makes it not so
 
03:23:14.450 --> 03:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
perfect is That vaccine Adverse Events
 
03:23:16.729 --> 03:23:16.739 align:start position:0%
are grossly underreported there are
 
03:23:19.729 --> 03:23:19.739 align:start position:0%
analyzes finding that the true number of
 
03:23:22.910 --> 03:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
reactions are 10 to 100 times higher
 
03:23:25.389 --> 03:23:25.399 align:start position:0%
than we have in the system
 
03:23:27.950 --> 03:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
even though medical professionals are
 
03:23:31.250 --> 03:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
required by federal law and in our New
 
03:23:33.190 --> 03:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute Pharmacy
 
03:23:35.630 --> 03:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
professionals are required to report
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events to theirs
 
03:23:40.190 --> 03:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
um this amendment adds an enforcement
 
03:23:40.200 --> 03:23:41.290 align:start position:0%
um this amendment adds an enforcement
mechanism

03:23:41.290 --> 03:23:41.300 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
03:23:44.330 --> 03:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
basically we're authorizing you this
 
03:23:46.309 --> 03:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
extra scope additional scope to your
 
03:23:49.849 --> 03:23:49.859 align:start position:0%
practice and we expect that with that
 
03:23:52.429 --> 03:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
there will be responsibility in
 
03:23:55.429 --> 03:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
following through with the requirements
 
03:23:57.490 --> 03:23:57.500 align:start position:0%
and if they can't be
 
03:24:00.830 --> 03:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
upheld what's in statute then the
 
03:24:02.809 --> 03:24:02.819 align:start position:0%
authorization to administer vaccines for
 
03:24:05.150 --> 03:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
an individual who was authorized by the
 
03:24:07.790 --> 03:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
statute will be revoked the Board of
 
03:24:09.769 --> 03:24:09.779 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy already has the authority under
 
03:24:13.670 --> 03:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
318 5A to accept complaints and revoke
 
03:24:15.710 --> 03:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
this authorization but this makes it
 
03:24:18.530 --> 03:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
clear that this is the consequence for
 
03:24:21.889 --> 03:24:21.899 align:start position:0%
for not reporting those events and
 
03:24:24.070 --> 03:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
there's a 60-day window
 
03:24:26.450 --> 03:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
within 60 days they just have to make
 
03:24:28.190 --> 03:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
that report if they after they become
 
03:24:30.050 --> 03:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
aware of a patient experiencing an
 
03:24:33.349 --> 03:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
adverse event and
 
03:24:35.090 --> 03:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
um the they're very specific they're
 
03:24:38.450 --> 03:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
listed and they they the farm receive
 
03:24:40.309 --> 03:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
professionals should know all of this
 
03:24:42.889 --> 03:24:42.899 align:start position:0%
information it's it's listed
 
03:24:44.929 --> 03:24:44.939 align:start position:0%
um on theirs there's a table of
 
03:24:47.410 --> 03:24:47.420 align:start position:0%
reportable events for every vaccine
 
03:24:49.969 --> 03:24:49.979 align:start position:0%
and they're
 
03:24:49.979 --> 03:24:50.570 align:start position:0%
and they're
um

03:24:50.570 --> 03:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:52.790 --> 03:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
and there are also vaccine manufacturer
 
03:24:54.229 --> 03:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
contraindications these are all things
 
03:24:55.429 --> 03:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
that you would expect someone
 
03:24:57.229 --> 03:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
administering these would would be aware
 
03:24:57.239 --> 03:24:58.130 align:start position:0%
administering these would would be aware
of

03:24:58.130 --> 03:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:25:00.950 --> 03:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
um so they get that 60-day window to put
 
03:25:04.070 --> 03:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
the report in because it can be timely
 
03:25:06.290 --> 03:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
um and you know from what we see it's
 
03:25:08.269 --> 03:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
pharmacists are not usually the ones who
 
03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
do find that someone has had an adverse
 
03:25:13.010 --> 03:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
reaction it's usually another
 
03:25:15.290 --> 03:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
professional but while we have this here
 
03:25:18.110 --> 03:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
if it is does take place and they are
 
03:25:20.330 --> 03:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
aware of it and no no
 
03:25:22.670 --> 03:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
um report has been submitted they then
 
03:25:24.410 --> 03:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
have to submit it if they want to
 
03:25:27.950 --> 03:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
continue to administer vaccinations
 
03:25:31.910 --> 03:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:33.830 --> 03:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'll speak against it but I also want to
 
03:25:35.929 --> 03:25:35.939 align:start position:0%
address some things first of all
 
03:25:37.790 --> 03:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
I've enjoyed working with representative
 
03:25:41.570 --> 03:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
Cushman on the vaccine Bill 1606 and
 
03:25:43.070 --> 03:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
trying to address the concerns that were
 
03:25:43.080 --> 03:25:44.210 align:start position:0%
trying to address the concerns that were
raised

03:25:44.210 --> 03:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
raised
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
let me talk about some of the concerns I
 
03:25:48.229 --> 03:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
see with this amendment one is the Board
 
03:25:51.769 --> 03:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacy as she stated currently has
 
03:25:54.229 --> 03:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
authority to discipline a pharmacist if
 
03:25:55.550 --> 03:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
there's something that they don't do
 
03:25:58.130 --> 03:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
that they should be doing
 
03:25:59.330 --> 03:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
um that's where the appropriate
 
03:26:01.849 --> 03:26:01.859 align:start position:0%
Authority resides to discipline the
 
03:26:04.670 --> 03:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
professional back to the licensing board
 
03:26:07.130 --> 03:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
number two it creates a double standard
 
03:26:10.190 --> 03:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
why as why do pharmacists have this
 
03:26:12.889 --> 03:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
requirement but Physicians don't Pas
 
03:26:15.590 --> 03:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
don't nurse practitioners don't anyone
 
03:26:17.450 --> 03:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
else out there who's given vaccines why
 
03:26:18.830 --> 03:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
they don't have the same requirement
 
03:26:21.110 --> 03:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
placed upon them I'll be willing to work
 
03:26:23.090 --> 03:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
with representative Cushman to deal with
 
03:26:24.950 --> 03:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
that issue more broadly and I'll talk
 
03:26:26.510 --> 03:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
about narrowly
 
03:26:30.290 --> 03:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
number three under the revocation
 
03:26:31.610 --> 03:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
the way I read it right now it's
 
03:26:33.650 --> 03:26:33.660 align:start position:0%
permanent there's no recourse you can't
 
03:26:35.870 --> 03:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
say to somebody well you're going to
 
03:26:39.290 --> 03:26:39.300 align:start position:0%
have your ability to immunize somebody
 
03:26:42.889 --> 03:26:42.899 align:start position:0%
for 90 days is it because at this point
 
03:26:44.570 --> 03:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
in time the way I read it it's permanent
 
03:26:46.490 --> 03:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
03:26:48.710 --> 03:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
um Authority by the board to reinstate
 
03:26:49.969 --> 03:26:49.979 align:start position:0%
the license
 
03:26:53.389 --> 03:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
number three or four Adverse Events many
 
03:26:53.399 --> 03:26:54.590 align:start position:0%
number three or four Adverse Events many
times

03:26:54.590 --> 03:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
times
 
03:26:56.450 --> 03:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
don't occur at the time of
 
03:27:00.050 --> 03:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
administration so you may have a patient
 
03:27:01.250 --> 03:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
that comes into the pharmacy you
 
03:27:02.990 --> 03:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
immunize the patient they sit there for
 
03:27:05.389 --> 03:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
30 minutes whatever time you think so
 
03:27:07.729 --> 03:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
a lot of Adverse Events are not
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
immediate they happen
 
03:27:13.210 --> 03:27:13.220 align:start position:0%
three four maybe a day or two later
 
03:27:14.990 --> 03:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be there at the
 
03:27:16.610 --> 03:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
pharmacy so how is the pharmacist going
 
03:27:19.490 --> 03:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
to know that the adverse event happened
 
03:27:21.530 --> 03:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
if they're not actually the one
 
03:27:23.690 --> 03:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
observing it and most of the time if a
 
03:27:26.450 --> 03:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
patient has an adverse event
 
03:27:28.070 --> 03:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
I would say they're going to call their
 
03:27:29.450 --> 03:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
Primary Care doc they're going to call
 
03:27:31.130 --> 03:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
somebody in the medical team
 
03:27:33.170 --> 03:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
not go back to the pharmacy so for all
 
03:27:35.510 --> 03:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
those reasons I think the intent of this
 
03:27:38.389 --> 03:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
is well intended but because of the
 
03:27:40.729 --> 03:27:40.739 align:start position:0%
things I talked about discipline is
 
03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
already there by the water Pharmacy
 
03:27:44.750 --> 03:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
somebody can call the board make a
 
03:27:44.760 --> 03:27:45.650 align:start position:0%
somebody can call the board make a
complaint

03:27:45.650 --> 03:27:45.660 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
03:27:47.269 --> 03:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
happens all the time
 
03:27:49.790 --> 03:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
it creates a double standard we have a
 
03:27:51.410 --> 03:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
stand for pharmacists but we don't apply
 
03:27:52.610 --> 03:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
the same standard to other Healthcare
 
03:27:52.620 --> 03:27:54.170 align:start position:0%
the same standard to other Healthcare
professionals

03:27:54.170 --> 03:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
03:27:57.590 --> 03:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
three there's no way to undo the
 
03:27:59.570 --> 03:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
replication it's permanent the way I
 
03:28:03.050 --> 03:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
read it now and four many Adverse Events
 
03:28:04.729 --> 03:28:04.739 align:start position:0%
that you want to be reported don't
 
03:28:06.050 --> 03:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
happen at the time they're in the
 
03:28:08.269 --> 03:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
pharmacy they're having subsequently and
 
03:28:09.769 --> 03:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
therefore the pharmacist would not know
 
03:28:11.330 --> 03:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
about it but they're now required to
 
03:28:13.250 --> 03:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
report something that they would not be
 
03:28:15.650 --> 03:28:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:17.570 --> 03:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
therefore I can't support the amendment
 
03:28:19.849 --> 03:28:19.859 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
03:28:23.269 --> 03:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
sure representative of Cushman
 
03:28:23.279 --> 03:28:25.190 align:start position:0%
sure representative of Cushman
sorry

03:28:25.190 --> 03:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:28:27.530 --> 03:28:27.540 align:start position:0%
um so it says that they have to be aware
 
03:28:30.290 --> 03:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
of it so it's once they become aware of
 
03:28:32.450 --> 03:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
it and as long as a report hasn't
 
03:28:34.729 --> 03:28:34.739 align:start position:0%
already been filed
 
03:28:37.130 --> 03:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
um so if they aren't aware of something
 
03:28:38.990 --> 03:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
there's no way that they can report it
 
03:28:40.490 --> 03:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
if if it goes to another Medical
 
03:28:42.170 --> 03:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
Professional then then that medical
 
03:28:44.210 --> 03:28:44.220 align:start position:0%
professional should be the one to report
 
03:28:44.220 --> 03:28:45.349 align:start position:0%
professional should be the one to report
it

03:28:45.349 --> 03:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:28:46.729 --> 03:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
um but if you're having a conversation
 
03:28:47.870 --> 03:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
with your pharmacist and you say you
 
03:28:50.090 --> 03:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
know last month after my flu shot you
 
03:28:52.429 --> 03:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
know I've had this lump on my on my arm
 
03:28:54.710 --> 03:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
that just won't go away
 
03:28:56.750 --> 03:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
um and the pharmacist doesn't report
 
03:28:59.150 --> 03:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
that then I think that would be an
 
03:29:02.630 --> 03:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
instance that this bill is here for
 
03:29:05.150 --> 03:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
um if they and if they the pharmacist
 
03:29:06.710 --> 03:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
would then ask you know have did you
 
03:29:09.530 --> 03:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
file a bear's report or did anyone and
 
03:29:11.030 --> 03:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
if they find out that none has been
 
03:29:13.010 --> 03:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
filed then it it should fall upon them
 
03:29:14.990 --> 03:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
to file it because they are the first
 
03:29:17.389 --> 03:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
point of contact and especially if after
 
03:29:20.630 --> 03:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
they were the ones who administered it
 
03:29:24.170 --> 03:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
um the board does have the authority
 
03:29:26.450 --> 03:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
um to discipline and but it is permanent
 
03:29:29.530 --> 03:29:29.540 align:start position:0%
for a reason because this is an extra
 
03:29:32.389 --> 03:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
authorization that we gave
 
03:29:36.170 --> 03:29:36.180 align:start position:0%
um and I think that it the consequence
 
03:29:37.910 --> 03:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be serious because these
 
03:29:40.429 --> 03:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
reactions are very serious people die
 
03:29:42.830 --> 03:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
from vaccine reactions people become
 
03:29:45.590 --> 03:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
sick for life and
 
03:29:48.229 --> 03:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
um I think the laws are are largely
 
03:29:52.010 --> 03:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
written in favor of protecting vaccine
 
03:29:56.090 --> 03:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and if if pharmacies are
 
03:29:58.910 --> 03:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
very fast-paced and
 
03:30:01.670 --> 03:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
I think that it's easy
 
03:30:01.680 --> 03:30:02.570 align:start position:0%
I think that it's easy
um

03:30:02.570 --> 03:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:04.370 --> 03:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
for things to slip through the cracks
 
03:30:06.830 --> 03:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
and we need to really send the message
 
03:30:08.929 --> 03:30:08.939 align:start position:0%
that this is very important and it's a
 
03:30:10.490 --> 03:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
requirement if you are going to be
 
03:30:13.190 --> 03:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
authorized to administer them they won't
 
03:30:14.750 --> 03:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily have any action taken
 
03:30:16.790 --> 03:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
against their license it's just this
 
03:30:19.130 --> 03:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
additional authorization that we've
 
03:30:21.110 --> 03:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
given these professionals
 
03:30:23.269 --> 03:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
they just it that individual won't be
 
03:30:24.710 --> 03:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
able to do it anymore so that was
 
03:30:24.720 --> 03:30:26.269 align:start position:0%
able to do it anymore so that was
deliberate

03:30:26.269 --> 03:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
deliberate
 
03:30:29.769 --> 03:30:29.779 align:start position:0%
um and the as far as a double standard
 
03:30:32.710 --> 03:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
these rules the
 
03:30:37.429 --> 03:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
under 318 16 B that we worked on I mean
 
03:30:39.469 --> 03:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
we we set these up and they're not in
 
03:30:41.510 --> 03:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
place for the other professions
 
03:30:43.790 --> 03:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
um and that is and it was a double
 
03:30:45.349 --> 03:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
standard then and we worked on that
 
03:30:47.210 --> 03:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
together and
 
03:30:49.849 --> 03:30:49.859 align:start position:0%
um the reason is because this is a new
 
03:30:49.859 --> 03:30:51.290 align:start position:0%
um the reason is because this is a new
area

03:30:51.290 --> 03:30:51.300 align:start position:0%
area
 
03:30:51.300 --> 03:30:52.070 align:start position:0%
area
um

03:30:52.070 --> 03:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:55.729 --> 03:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
where these professionals have a new
 
03:30:59.150 --> 03:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
um scope added to or a new authorization
 
03:31:01.610 --> 03:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
added to their scope of practice and I
 
03:31:04.010 --> 03:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
think it's important because they may
 
03:31:06.410 --> 03:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
not always be in this situation where
 
03:31:08.510 --> 03:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
they're used to follow doing this kind
 
03:31:12.170 --> 03:31:12.180 align:start position:0%
of surveillance so it needs to be here
 
03:31:14.570 --> 03:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
um and I would like to see it you know
 
03:31:16.490 --> 03:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
add it to other professions too if this
 
03:31:19.070 --> 03:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
is a problem across the board let's deal
 
03:31:20.690 --> 03:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
with it we have this in front of us now
 
03:31:23.269 --> 03:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
we want to add more vaccines to
 
03:31:25.790 --> 03:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
authorize them to do these vaccines fine
 
03:31:27.769 --> 03:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
but let's just put the the Safeguard in
 
03:31:27.779 --> 03:31:31.250 align:start position:0%
but let's just put the the Safeguard in
place

03:31:31.250 --> 03:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:34.250 --> 03:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
03:31:37.190 --> 03:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you I share some of the concerns
 
03:31:39.710 --> 03:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
that representative Merchant has but
 
03:31:42.229 --> 03:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
um on the other I also have
 
03:31:45.050 --> 03:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
um considerable amount of
 
03:31:45.060 --> 03:31:48.229 align:start position:0%
um considerable amount of
um

03:31:48.229 --> 03:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:50.809 --> 03:31:50.819 align:start position:0%
thinking about that this is a problem
 
03:31:52.969 --> 03:31:52.979 align:start position:0%
that should be addressed and I have a
 
03:31:54.469 --> 03:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
confession to make that I had the
 
03:31:56.389 --> 03:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
coveted vaccine and I had an adverse
 
03:31:57.889 --> 03:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
reaction and
 
03:32:01.490 --> 03:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
nobody said anything about reporting it
 
03:32:01.500 --> 03:32:02.990 align:start position:0%
nobody said anything about reporting it
um

03:32:02.990 --> 03:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:05.090 --> 03:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
so that was a little bit confusing to me
 
03:32:07.130 --> 03:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
eventually I reported it
 
03:32:07.140 --> 03:32:09.290 align:start position:0%
eventually I reported it
um

03:32:09.290 --> 03:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:12.170 --> 03:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
one of my questions about the specifics
 
03:32:15.950 --> 03:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
of this amendment is that
 
03:32:19.070 --> 03:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
the last sentence where it says failure
 
03:32:21.530 --> 03:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
where it talks about the consequence for
 
03:32:23.990 --> 03:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
not submitting a report
 
03:32:28.070 --> 03:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:32.450 --> 03:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
who's whose authority to provide these
 
03:32:35.210 --> 03:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
vaccines would be revoked would it be
 
03:32:37.429 --> 03:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy would it be the pharmacy
 
03:32:40.670 --> 03:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
tech who gave the would it be the person
 
03:32:43.729 --> 03:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
or would it be the organization
 
03:32:45.950 --> 03:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
it would be the person it's a it says
 
03:32:48.110 --> 03:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
anyone authorized to administer under
 
03:32:50.330 --> 03:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
the section in the section authorizes
 
03:32:52.910 --> 03:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy pharmacists Pharmacy interns
 
03:32:55.370 --> 03:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
and lysis
 
03:32:58.790 --> 03:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy assistance sorry I'm pharmacy
 
03:33:00.469 --> 03:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
technicians and who would have the
 
03:33:03.530 --> 03:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to to make that decision to
 
03:33:05.870 --> 03:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
keep track of it the Board of Pharmacy
 
03:33:05.880 --> 03:33:07.370 align:start position:0%
keep track of it the Board of Pharmacy
under

03:33:07.370 --> 03:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
under
 
03:33:09.590 --> 03:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
um the parent section

um it's 318 colon 5 Dash a is where they
 
03:33:14.760 --> 03:33:16.130 align:start position:0%
um it's 318 colon 5 Dash a is where they
have

03:33:16.130 --> 03:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:33:19.030 --> 03:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
um the ability to make rules and
 
03:33:24.050 --> 03:33:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:26.030 --> 03:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
03:33:28.849 --> 03:33:28.859 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman
 
03:33:28.859 --> 03:33:29.690 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman
um

03:33:29.690 --> 03:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:31.729 --> 03:33:31.739 align:start position:0%
my question is for representative
 
03:33:31.739 --> 03:33:32.750 align:start position:0%
my question is for representative
Merchant

03:33:32.750 --> 03:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
03:33:36.229 --> 03:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
um if you were hypothetically a a
 
03:33:38.809 --> 03:33:38.819 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and you administered a
 
03:33:42.170 --> 03:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
vaccine and I think you're right 99 of
 
03:33:43.550 --> 03:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
the time it's going to be right then and
 
03:33:45.530 --> 03:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
there but if you did see somebody
 
03:33:49.130 --> 03:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
experience an adverse reaction why
 
03:33:51.050 --> 03:33:51.060 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you report it to Bears is there
 
03:33:53.330 --> 03:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
is there some financial burden or time
 
03:33:55.490 --> 03:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
burden that would make it prohibitive or
 
03:33:57.590 --> 03:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
I just don't understand thank you
 
03:34:01.309 --> 03:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
no it I would say if you are with a
 
03:34:03.290 --> 03:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
patient and say the patient came from a
 
03:34:05.389 --> 03:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
physician's office and it was
 
03:34:07.630 --> 03:34:07.640 align:start position:0%
um three or four hours after the visit
 
03:34:10.550 --> 03:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
and you talk to the patient the patient
 
03:34:11.990 --> 03:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
says they think you can have an adverse
 
03:34:14.269 --> 03:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
event you should be at that point in
 
03:34:16.910 --> 03:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
time reporting it because you're the one
 
03:34:19.370 --> 03:34:19.380 align:start position:0%
aware of it the question at that point
 
03:34:21.889 --> 03:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
in time is that as the pharmacist is
 
03:34:22.910 --> 03:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with the patient you're
 
03:34:24.290 --> 03:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
encountered with them
 
03:34:26.870 --> 03:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
if they're hearing from the patient
 
03:34:28.250 --> 03:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
about a concern
 
03:34:30.349 --> 03:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
and that concern elevates it to a point
 
03:34:34.130 --> 03:34:34.140 align:start position:0%
of being an adverse event to a vaccine
 
03:34:37.370 --> 03:34:37.380 align:start position:0%
they should be reporting it
 
03:34:39.110 --> 03:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't always have to be the vaccine
 
03:34:40.910 --> 03:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
that you gave it could be a vaccine
 
03:34:42.650 --> 03:34:42.660 align:start position:0%
someone else gave you become an aware of
 
03:34:45.650 --> 03:34:45.660 align:start position:0%
it so under the
 
03:34:48.670 --> 03:34:48.680 align:start position:0%
board if you are become aware of any
 
03:34:51.469 --> 03:34:51.479 align:start position:0%
adverse event to a vaccine regardless if
 
03:34:52.790 --> 03:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
you gave it or not you should be the one
 
03:34:54.410 --> 03:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
reporting and helping the patients
 
03:34:56.389 --> 03:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
report it
 
03:34:58.670 --> 03:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
03:35:03.170 --> 03:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and this kind of if I
 
03:35:04.849 --> 03:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
03:35:06.370 --> 03:35:06.380 align:start position:0%
um representative Merchants
 
03:35:09.050 --> 03:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
administrative concerns uh with the
 
03:35:10.910 --> 03:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
amendment and and I I share those
 
03:35:10.920 --> 03:35:12.229 align:start position:0%
amendment and and I I share those
concerns

03:35:12.229 --> 03:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
03:35:15.349 --> 03:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
um you know but I I do think that
 
03:35:17.870 --> 03:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
as we do these things there has to be
 
03:35:20.570 --> 03:35:20.580 align:start position:0%
some teeth somewhere I myself personally
 
03:35:23.450 --> 03:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
was very frustrated trying to opt out of
 
03:35:27.530 --> 03:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
the registry and if indeed we do have a
 
03:35:30.110 --> 03:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
chronic amount of Under reporting with
 
03:35:31.849 --> 03:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
respect to theirs
 
03:35:33.650 --> 03:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
um I guess maybe you know the answer
 
03:35:36.469 --> 03:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
just maybe you don't are you aware are
 
03:35:38.809 --> 03:35:38.819 align:start position:0%
there any current consequences
 
03:35:42.229 --> 03:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
um at all with respect to reporting or
 
03:35:44.570 --> 03:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
what are they if they if they do exist
 
03:35:47.150 --> 03:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
the consequence would be with Board of
 
03:35:49.190 --> 03:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy if someone is doing some the
 
03:35:50.690 --> 03:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
Federal Law requires it and if you're
 
03:35:52.010 --> 03:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
not following the federal law or
 
03:35:54.050 --> 03:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
following the state law the Board of
 
03:35:56.630 --> 03:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy has under jurisdiction
 
03:35:58.550 --> 03:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
can at that point in time discipline the
 
03:36:00.229 --> 03:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
pharmacist for doing something they
 
03:36:02.090 --> 03:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
should have done so the appropriate
 
03:36:03.530 --> 03:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
place to bring this is before the Board
 
03:36:05.570 --> 03:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacy like any other professional
 
03:36:07.790 --> 03:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
board because of doing something that
 
03:36:10.969 --> 03:36:10.979 align:start position:0%
the law federal estate requires them to
 
03:36:13.550 --> 03:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
accomplish a quick follow-up follow-up
 
03:36:16.070 --> 03:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
yeah and and I'm just trying to learn
 
03:36:19.729 --> 03:36:19.739 align:start position:0%
are you aware or anybody from in this
 
03:36:23.510 --> 03:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
Committee of with respect to the
 
03:36:26.510 --> 03:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
registry or with respect to Bears of any
 
03:36:28.670 --> 03:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
activity in this regard any hearings
 
03:36:30.590 --> 03:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
before the pharmacy board or the medical
 
03:36:30.600 --> 03:36:31.849 align:start position:0%
before the pharmacy board or the medical
board

03:36:31.849 --> 03:36:31.859 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:36:34.790 --> 03:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
um is this actively happening or is it
 
03:36:36.290 --> 03:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
just a check box
 
03:36:38.210 --> 03:36:38.220 align:start position:0%
it um
 
03:36:39.950 --> 03:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
I haven't been on the board now for
 
03:36:42.170 --> 03:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
about three years but I can share with
 
03:36:43.790 --> 03:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
you my 10 years on the board this will
 
03:36:45.110 --> 03:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
come into what they call non-public
 
03:36:45.120 --> 03:36:46.190 align:start position:0%
come into what they call non-public
hearing

03:36:46.190 --> 03:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:36:48.469 --> 03:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
so therefore the board would listen to
 
03:36:50.090 --> 03:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
03:36:53.389 --> 03:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
during a non-public hearing at that
 
03:36:55.250 --> 03:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
point in time if it gets to a point of
 
03:36:57.170 --> 03:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
discipline then the discipline would go
 
03:37:00.229 --> 03:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
into a public hearing but many times a
 
03:37:01.670 --> 03:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
lot of the things are discussed because
 
03:37:03.170 --> 03:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
we're trying to protect the professional
 
03:37:06.050 --> 03:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
until some ruling occurs so a lot of
 
03:37:09.290 --> 03:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
times we hear things in the board in a
 
03:37:11.030 --> 03:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
non-public manner
 
03:37:13.969 --> 03:37:13.979 align:start position:0%
in order to protect both the patient as
 
03:37:16.790 --> 03:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
well as the practitioner until the board
 
03:37:19.370 --> 03:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
ultimately makes a decision so
 
03:37:21.650 --> 03:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
many times we've had things coming to
 
03:37:22.849 --> 03:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
the board
 
03:37:26.570 --> 03:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
and we act on it in non-public but we
 
03:37:28.729 --> 03:37:28.739 align:start position:0%
came out of public and act on it in
 
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:35.269 --> 03:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
no I don't I don't know because I
 
03:37:36.290 --> 03:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
haven't been on the board for three
 
03:37:38.630 --> 03:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
years since that point in time but I
 
03:37:40.130 --> 03:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
could do some research I don't know of
 
03:37:42.229 --> 03:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
anything it's been a problem
 
03:37:44.570 --> 03:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
um I do know at this point in time
 
03:37:46.190 --> 03:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
there's been some concern by the medical
 
03:37:48.349 --> 03:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
community about not getting reports over
 
03:37:50.090 --> 03:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
to the primary care doc but that goes
 
03:37:51.889 --> 03:37:51.899 align:start position:0%
back to the same thing sometimes the
 
03:37:53.990 --> 03:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
patients don't want to report it
 
03:37:57.349 --> 03:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
because the statute says only report it
 
03:38:01.370 --> 03:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:03.769 --> 03:38:03.779 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
03:38:06.349 --> 03:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
it was sort of in in the line of this
 
03:38:08.269 --> 03:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
because I'm definitely concerned about
 
03:38:11.690 --> 03:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
somebody losing their you know
 
03:38:16.790 --> 03:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
for one error losing their authorization
 
03:38:19.190 --> 03:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
to administer vaccines
 
03:38:21.349 --> 03:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
um and particularly depending on the
 
03:38:23.090 --> 03:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
severity there's no there's nothing here
 
03:38:25.370 --> 03:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
about severity so I pretty much always
 
03:38:27.950 --> 03:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
have a low-grade fever after I get a flu
 
03:38:29.990 --> 03:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
shot but I don't that doesn't get
 
03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:31.550 align:start position:0%
shot but I don't that doesn't get
reported

03:38:31.550 --> 03:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
reported
 
03:38:33.650 --> 03:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would be much more
 
03:38:36.590 --> 03:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable if this said something like
 
03:38:38.570 --> 03:38:38.580 align:start position:0%
UH 60 days of becoming aware of
 
03:38:41.750 --> 03:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
anniversary adverse event
 
03:38:44.990 --> 03:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
in a patient result that that the Board
 
03:38:46.849 --> 03:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacy would be notified
 
03:38:49.309 --> 03:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
so that you put it back to the Board of
 
03:38:53.210 --> 03:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy who has the authority to to
 
03:38:53.220 --> 03:38:54.710 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy who has the authority to to
um

03:38:54.710 --> 03:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:58.429 --> 03:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
meet whatever Justice is required by the
 
03:39:00.889 --> 03:39:00.899 align:start position:0%
the offense
 
03:39:03.889 --> 03:39:03.899 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
03:39:03.899 --> 03:39:05.150 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
I

03:39:05.150 --> 03:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:39:08.389 --> 03:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
my mine is a also a question to the
 
03:39:10.550 --> 03:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
licensed Professionals in the room who
 
03:39:14.030 --> 03:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
might be subject to this uh it seems to
 
03:39:15.590 --> 03:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
me that we're all agreed that the
 
03:39:18.830 --> 03:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
difference with the pharmacist from a
 
03:39:21.650 --> 03:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
primary care provider or or other who
 
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
might have administered the uh an
 
03:39:26.510 --> 03:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
injection and of course if we put this
 
03:39:28.670 --> 03:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
in here it will reply to all injections
 
03:39:34.550 --> 03:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
not just the um not just the the new one
 
03:39:38.330 --> 03:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:40.969 --> 03:39:40.979 align:start position:0%
going back to what you were saying about
 
03:39:43.550 --> 03:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
if you get an injection from your
 
03:39:47.030 --> 03:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
primary care provider and suddenly your
 
03:39:50.570 --> 03:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
arms turning red and looking icky you
 
03:39:53.330 --> 03:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
you go back and say Hey you know I think
 
03:39:56.050 --> 03:39:56.060 align:start position:0%
that vaccine was a problem
 
03:39:58.490 --> 03:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
what do I do about this but you're going
 
03:39:59.690 --> 03:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
to do that with your primary care
 
03:40:01.070 --> 03:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
provider you're not going to go back to
 
03:40:04.370 --> 03:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist and say that and I guess
 
03:40:06.429 --> 03:40:06.439 align:start position:0%
one of the things I'm
 
03:40:09.050 --> 03:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
worried about is we have the becoming
 
03:40:12.950 --> 03:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
aware of language and so you're at your
 
03:40:15.650 --> 03:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
kids little league game and somebody you
 
03:40:19.190 --> 03:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
saw a week ago comes up to you and says
 
03:40:22.250 --> 03:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
hey uh you know you gave me that jab
 
03:40:25.309 --> 03:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
last week and uh
 
03:40:27.950 --> 03:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
you know my arm doesn't look so good and
 
03:40:29.330 --> 03:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
you say well you know I think you should
 
03:40:30.590 --> 03:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
check that out with your primary care
 
03:40:32.830 --> 03:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
provider that was the first thing I'd do
 
03:40:36.790 --> 03:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh but then your kid gets hit with a
 
03:40:39.469 --> 03:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
fastball and you're dealing with taking
 
03:40:42.110 --> 03:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
the kid off this is tenuous I understand
 
03:40:42.120 --> 03:40:43.190 align:start position:0%
the kid off this is tenuous I understand
but

03:40:43.190 --> 03:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:40:47.090 --> 03:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
uh there are reasons that you might it
 
03:40:49.130 --> 03:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
might slip your mind under those
 
03:40:51.050 --> 03:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
conditions that you were actually told
 
03:40:56.690 --> 03:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
about an adverse reaction and your
 
03:40:59.690 --> 03:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
um licenses now on the line and and I
 
03:41:01.969 --> 03:41:01.979 align:start position:0%
think it also goes back to the
 
03:41:05.090 --> 03:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
fundamental fairness issue but it if
 
03:41:07.849 --> 03:41:07.859 align:start position:0%
this is already required by federal
 
03:41:07.859 --> 03:41:09.349 align:start position:0%
this is already required by federal
statutes

03:41:09.349 --> 03:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
03:41:12.889 --> 03:41:12.899 align:start position:0%
then it seems to me that adding it
 
03:41:16.309 --> 03:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
piecemeal into our statutes doesn't make
 
03:41:19.130 --> 03:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
sense if what you want is for this to
 
03:41:21.290 --> 03:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
happen it ought to be a standalone bill
 
03:41:25.550 --> 03:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
that then tracks the federal statute in
 
03:41:28.190 --> 03:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
our law but if it's already in the
 
03:41:29.990 --> 03:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
federal statute it doesn't need to be in
 
03:41:34.090 --> 03:41:34.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:35.630 --> 03:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant then
 
03:41:38.210 --> 03:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman he represent
 
03:41:40.370 --> 03:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
whatever raise a good point when you
 
03:41:43.429 --> 03:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
talk about replication as permanent
 
03:41:43.439 --> 03:41:44.870 align:start position:0%
talk about replication as permanent
in

03:41:44.870 --> 03:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:41:46.490 --> 03:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy today
 
03:41:49.729 --> 03:41:49.739 align:start position:0%
if you cannot immunize a patient
 
03:41:51.590 --> 03:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
you don't have a job
 
03:41:53.330 --> 03:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
so you're not talking about this point
 
03:41:55.309 --> 03:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
in time of just losing the possibility
 
03:41:57.290 --> 03:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
of a license but losing a possibility of
 
03:41:58.729 --> 03:41:58.739 align:start position:0%
a livelihood so
 
03:42:00.650 --> 03:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
it's something not to take lightly I
 
03:42:02.510 --> 03:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
don't think we should be ignoring the
 
03:42:04.370 --> 03:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements but when you talk
 
03:42:07.070 --> 03:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
about something that's horrific
 
03:42:10.849 --> 03:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
revoked with no termination to it
 
03:42:13.309 --> 03:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
the consequence to the professional is
 
03:42:13.319 --> 03:42:14.150 align:start position:0%
the consequence to the professional is
dire

03:42:14.150 --> 03:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
dire
 
03:42:16.070 --> 03:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that point in time
 
03:42:18.229 --> 03:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
is not just losing the ability to
 
03:42:20.150 --> 03:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
immunize but if you can't immunize you
 
03:42:22.070 --> 03:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
probably won't be employed by a pharmacy
 
03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
Walgreens and so forth because they
 
03:42:25.849 --> 03:42:25.859 align:start position:0%
require you to have that certification
 
03:42:28.370 --> 03:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
in order to be employed there so I just
 
03:42:30.590 --> 03:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
want to stress to you folks the gravity
 
03:42:34.969 --> 03:42:34.979 align:start position:0%
of this situation is extremely high
 
03:42:37.190 --> 03:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
and at the same time
 
03:42:39.530 --> 03:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at the likelihood of
 
03:42:41.210 --> 03:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
it happening or people losing track of
 
03:42:42.769 --> 03:42:42.779 align:start position:0%
it to what is the Weber's point of view
 
03:42:45.469 --> 03:42:45.479 align:start position:0%
it can happen in that one simple thing
 
03:42:48.830 --> 03:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
means all of a sudden your ability to
 
03:42:50.570 --> 03:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
provide for your family and so forth is
 
03:42:52.670 --> 03:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
totally off the table and I think that's
 
03:42:54.050 --> 03:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
one of my concerns when you talk about
 
03:42:55.610 --> 03:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
this whole thing the gravity of it's
 
03:42:55.620 --> 03:42:56.690 align:start position:0%
this whole thing the gravity of it's
huge

03:42:56.690 --> 03:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
huge
 
03:42:58.910 --> 03:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
03:42:58.920 --> 03:43:00.410 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
chairman

03:43:00.410 --> 03:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:43:02.330 --> 03:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
um I understand the concern there but
 
03:43:04.130 --> 03:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
it's not true that if you can't
 
03:43:05.690 --> 03:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
administer vaccinations that you
 
03:43:07.849 --> 03:43:07.859 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a job as a pharmacy tech I
 
03:43:09.469 --> 03:43:09.479 align:start position:0%
mean there are other
 
03:43:11.630 --> 03:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
um pharmacies that are not public facing
 
03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
that do not administer vaccines they
 
03:43:15.769 --> 03:43:15.779 align:start position:0%
deliver to nursing homes they deliver to
 
03:43:17.690 --> 03:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
assisted livings
 
03:43:19.550 --> 03:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
um there are mail-in mail order
 
03:43:22.490 --> 03:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
pharmacies there are IV pharmacies there
 
03:43:24.290 --> 03:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
are pharmacies and hospitals and other
 
03:43:27.170 --> 03:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
medical facilities I mean there is a
 
03:43:29.170 --> 03:43:29.180 align:start position:0%
wide range of Pharmacy
 
03:43:31.790 --> 03:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
positions and they don't all administer
 
03:43:31.800 --> 03:43:33.650 align:start position:0%
positions and they don't all administer
vaccinations

03:43:33.650 --> 03:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
03:43:38.990 --> 03:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
um and as far as the um the scenario
 
03:43:43.490 --> 03:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
that representative Weber posited I
 
03:43:46.010 --> 03:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
first of all it's highly unlikely but
 
03:43:48.889 --> 03:43:48.899 align:start position:0%
um it's within 60 days I mean you have
 
03:43:50.990 --> 03:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
60 days after hearing about it that's
 
03:43:56.389 --> 03:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
two months to file the report and
 
03:43:59.510 --> 03:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's I think it's a it's a long
 
03:44:01.490 --> 03:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
enough period of time to give for
 
03:44:02.809 --> 03:44:02.819 align:start position:0%
someone to do that and I really don't
 
03:44:04.370 --> 03:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
think that there's any excuse not to do
 
03:44:07.130 --> 03:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
it as a medical professional anyway you
 
03:44:07.140 --> 03:44:07.849 align:start position:0%
it as a medical professional anyway you
know

03:44:07.849 --> 03:44:07.859 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:44:10.429 --> 03:44:10.439 align:start position:0%
um and this is a privilege that we have
 
03:44:10.439 --> 03:44:11.630 align:start position:0%
um and this is a privilege that we have
awarded

03:44:11.630 --> 03:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
awarded
 
03:44:14.210 --> 03:44:14.220 align:start position:0%
um the pharmacists to to administer
 
03:44:17.330 --> 03:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
these medical interventions and we need
 
03:44:19.729 --> 03:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they are doing it safely
 
03:44:21.290 --> 03:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
and if there's no reason that they
 
03:44:21.300 --> 03:44:22.729 align:start position:0%
and if there's no reason that they
wouldn't

03:44:22.729 --> 03:44:22.739 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
03:44:25.250 --> 03:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
um not that they would not file Affairs
 
03:44:27.830 --> 03:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
report then this is just a heavy warning
 
03:44:30.530 --> 03:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
if this is if this isn't happening and
 
03:44:33.290 --> 03:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
and they're they're doing their due
 
03:44:34.849 --> 03:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
diligence and following through with the
 
03:44:34.859 --> 03:44:35.630 align:start position:0%
diligence and following through with the
care

03:44:35.630 --> 03:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:44:38.870 --> 03:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
then then there's no consequence to fear
 
03:44:41.389 --> 03:44:41.399 align:start position:0%
but I think that if they're not that
 
03:44:43.150 --> 03:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be administering vaccines
 
03:44:46.790 --> 03:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
I would also remind people that
 
03:44:48.530 --> 03:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right representative
 
03:44:50.690 --> 03:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
Cushman the technicians can give
 
03:44:53.269 --> 03:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
vaccines but the
 
03:44:55.550 --> 03:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement falls on the farm
 
03:44:58.729 --> 03:44:58.739 align:start position:0%
assist not the pharmacy technician so if
 
03:45:00.229 --> 03:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
pharmacy technician was to give a
 
03:45:02.330 --> 03:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
vaccine under the supervision of a
 
03:45:04.010 --> 03:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and the pharmacist is busy
 
03:45:06.889 --> 03:45:06.899 align:start position:0%
they justify that the patient qualifies
 
03:45:09.110 --> 03:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
for the vaccine they have a technician
 
03:45:11.570 --> 03:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
who's been trained to give the vaccine
 
03:45:13.910 --> 03:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
technician gives the vaccine and doesn't
 
03:45:15.410 --> 03:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
tell the pharmacist about an adverse
 
03:45:15.420 --> 03:45:16.790 align:start position:0%
tell the pharmacist about an adverse
event

03:45:16.790 --> 03:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
event
 
03:45:19.190 --> 03:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's not the technician who's going to
 
03:45:21.110 --> 03:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
be held accountable it's the pharmacist
 
03:45:22.729 --> 03:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones that have three
 
03:45:25.070 --> 03:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
requirement to report it
 
03:45:26.510 --> 03:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman I mean
 
03:45:27.710 --> 03:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
representative Leon and then
 
03:45:29.389 --> 03:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
representative alberger
 
03:45:31.429 --> 03:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
03:45:33.290 --> 03:45:33.300 align:start position:0%
um I think this is touching on one of
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
the critical things that our current
 
03:45:37.389 --> 03:45:37.399 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure relies on
 
03:45:39.950 --> 03:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
post-market surveillance is critical in
 
03:45:42.229 --> 03:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
order to ensure the ongoing safety of
 
03:45:45.110 --> 03:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
any product that's approved by the FDA
 
03:45:47.450 --> 03:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
um I I haven't dug into the the
 
03:45:49.429 --> 03:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
specifications of the trials around the
 
03:45:52.610 --> 03:45:52.620 align:start position:0%
RSB vaccine but I do know that the covet
 
03:45:55.670 --> 03:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine was significantly handicapped by
 
03:45:57.590 --> 03:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that the
 
03:46:00.110 --> 03:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
um the crossover allowed basically made
 
03:46:02.929 --> 03:46:02.939 align:start position:0%
it so that you couldn't evaluate any
 
03:46:05.750 --> 03:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
long-term effects so that left that one
 
03:46:08.690 --> 03:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
vaccine to evaluate based on post-market
 
03:46:10.490 --> 03:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
surveillance through vares and other
 
03:46:13.550 --> 03:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
Associated ways to catch Adverse Events
 
03:46:15.769 --> 03:46:15.779 align:start position:0%
in the community now I'm biased to
 
03:46:18.650 --> 03:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
what's happened in my career we had we
 
03:46:20.510 --> 03:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
had the cardiovascular stents the drug
 
03:46:22.610 --> 03:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
eluding stents they were great until
 
03:46:24.290 --> 03:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
they started flaking off and they
 
03:46:26.090 --> 03:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
started killing people with blood clots
 
03:46:28.190 --> 03:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
because they were only anticoagulating
 
03:46:30.410 --> 03:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
for a certain amount of time because
 
03:46:31.969 --> 03:46:31.979 align:start position:0%
people were keeping track of these
 
03:46:34.389 --> 03:46:34.399 align:start position:0%
events and because there were some
 
03:46:36.290 --> 03:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
Pathologists who were really digging
 
03:46:37.969 --> 03:46:37.979 align:start position:0%
into it they were able to determine what
 
03:46:40.510 --> 03:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
happened but that doesn't always happen
 
03:46:43.690 --> 03:46:43.700 align:start position:0%
there's vaccines then have nebulous
 
03:46:46.490 --> 03:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events and you end up looking at
 
03:46:49.070 --> 03:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
a very large sample and with that large
 
03:46:51.830 --> 03:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
sample you need to catch events in that
 
03:46:53.690 --> 03:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
I would actually argue that those
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
low-grade fevers are exactly the sort of
 
03:46:58.190 --> 03:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
thing that should be in there because
 
03:47:00.530 --> 03:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the whole universe of
 
03:47:02.150 --> 03:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
those Adverse Events and then you would
 
03:47:04.250 --> 03:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
know that those are events where all you
 
03:47:05.929 --> 03:47:05.939 align:start position:0%
had was the low grade fever and you
 
03:47:08.330 --> 03:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
didn't develop other complications from
 
03:47:11.210 --> 03:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
that vaccination without data we can't
 
03:47:13.729 --> 03:47:13.739 align:start position:0%
make decisions and I think that it is
 
03:47:15.530 --> 03:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical that not just with
 
03:47:17.450 --> 03:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
pharmacists but if we follow up in the
 
03:47:19.849 --> 03:47:19.859 align:start position:0%
future to have everybody else who's
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
unable to provide immunizations also
 
03:47:24.410 --> 03:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
have to report to theirs I think that
 
03:47:26.269 --> 03:47:26.279 align:start position:0%
that is absolute critical in order to
 
03:47:28.309 --> 03:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
have a good quality of data because
 
03:47:30.590 --> 03:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
right now those data are limited by the
 
03:47:32.389 --> 03:47:32.399 align:start position:0%
fact that only some some events are
 
03:47:35.030 --> 03:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
reported we're better off with with a
 
03:47:37.429 --> 03:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
larger pool of data than we are with one
 
03:47:39.950 --> 03:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
that is um
 
03:47:43.250 --> 03:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
one that's truncated so um while I I
 
03:47:46.250 --> 03:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
appreciate that maybe there could be
 
03:47:48.410 --> 03:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
something about becoming aware in their
 
03:47:51.349 --> 03:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
professional capacity of an adverse
 
03:47:52.849 --> 03:47:52.859 align:start position:0%
event so that you're not hearing it on
 
03:47:55.070 --> 03:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
the ball field or in passing I think
 
03:47:58.190 --> 03:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
that it's absolutely important that
 
03:48:00.530 --> 03:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
that we have our Pharmacists and our
 
03:48:02.389 --> 03:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
pharmacy techs as a first line of
 
03:48:05.090 --> 03:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
defense to catch any late events and to
 
03:48:06.349 --> 03:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
catch these ones that are not otherwise
 
03:48:09.530 --> 03:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
captured representative alberger
 
03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my guess based on
 
03:48:15.050 --> 03:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
basically no information except my own
 
03:48:18.769 --> 03:48:18.779 align:start position:0%
experience is that the greatest loss of
 
03:48:21.410 --> 03:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
information about adverse reactions
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
comes from the fact that we as patients
 
03:48:24.969 --> 03:48:24.979 align:start position:0%
don't report them
 
03:48:29.630 --> 03:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
I've had minor aches and and pains from
 
03:48:32.030 --> 03:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
covid reaction worse from flu and even
 
03:48:34.429 --> 03:48:34.439 align:start position:0%
worse from shingles and I never reported
 
03:48:37.250 --> 03:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
them to anybody my guess is that that's
 
03:48:39.229 --> 03:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
true more often than not unless somebody
 
03:48:42.410 --> 03:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
is extraordinarily ill
 
03:48:45.469 --> 03:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
um so trying to in some way hold a
 
03:48:45.479 --> 03:48:47.050 align:start position:0%
um so trying to in some way hold a
provider

03:48:47.050 --> 03:48:47.060 align:start position:0%
provider
 
03:48:49.969 --> 03:48:49.979 align:start position:0%
responsible for not getting information
 
03:48:49.979 --> 03:48:51.550 align:start position:0%
responsible for not getting information
in

03:48:51.550 --> 03:48:51.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:48:53.389 --> 03:48:53.399 align:start position:0%
leads the
 
03:48:57.229 --> 03:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
provider at at a distinctly unfair
 
03:49:00.050 --> 03:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
in a distinctly unfair situation and the
 
03:49:03.050 --> 03:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
other comment that I wanted to offer is
 
03:49:06.410 --> 03:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
if the reporting requirements already
 
03:49:09.590 --> 03:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
exist with federal law that have
 
03:49:12.170 --> 03:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
punishments attached then setting
 
03:49:15.170 --> 03:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
another piece of legislation up here in
 
03:49:16.330 --> 03:49:16.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:49:18.769 --> 03:49:18.779 align:start position:0%
is the Department of redundancy
 
03:49:18.779 --> 03:49:20.330 align:start position:0%
is the Department of redundancy
Department

03:49:20.330 --> 03:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
Department
 
03:49:20.340 --> 03:49:21.110 align:start position:0%
Department
um

03:49:21.110 --> 03:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:24.110 --> 03:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
we had a conversation a little while ago
 
03:49:26.830 --> 03:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
about there are too many committees
 
03:49:30.290 --> 03:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
and this in a different way seems to me
 
03:49:32.570 --> 03:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
very similar thank you representative
 
03:49:34.070 --> 03:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
Palmer and then representative King and
 
03:49:36.290 --> 03:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
then representative Kushner so I just to
 
03:49:39.830 --> 03:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
clarify my position is I have no issue
 
03:49:42.290 --> 03:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
at all with getting data and Reporting
 
03:49:44.530 --> 03:49:44.540 align:start position:0%
and I agree with you that in the past
 
03:49:47.990 --> 03:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
we've not done well with post marketing
 
03:49:51.710 --> 03:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
um uh issues that have come up I think
 
03:49:54.170 --> 03:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
that here this the last sentence is that
 
03:49:55.969 --> 03:49:55.979 align:start position:0%
the punishment does not fit the crime
 
03:49:59.690 --> 03:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
it's too severe and that and and if if
 
03:50:01.969 --> 03:50:01.979 align:start position:0%
it if the remedy already exists in
 
03:50:04.490 --> 03:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
federal law then great if the federal
 
03:50:06.950 --> 03:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
law isn't strong enough
 
03:50:09.290 --> 03:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
you know something a little bit less
 
03:50:12.110 --> 03:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
than you know you're out one strike and
 
03:50:13.610 --> 03:50:13.620 align:start position:0%
you're out we we need something a little
 
03:50:15.830 --> 03:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
bit less so I'd like to see maybe a
 
03:50:17.450 --> 03:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
little compromise representative King
 
03:50:19.729 --> 03:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
and then representative Bushman I see
 
03:50:21.530 --> 03:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
both sides of this
 
03:50:23.090 --> 03:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
um debate
 
03:50:25.250 --> 03:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
um I agree with both sides
 
03:50:27.410 --> 03:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
um my question is mainly directed
 
03:50:29.210 --> 03:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
towards Representatives Cushman and
 
03:50:32.030 --> 03:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
Merchant a possible
 
03:50:33.590 --> 03:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
a possible
 
03:50:33.600 --> 03:50:35.750 align:start position:0%
a possible
um

03:50:35.750 --> 03:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:37.790 --> 03:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
agreement could be made if we just
 
03:50:40.070 --> 03:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
change one word I'm thinking instead of
 
03:50:42.050 --> 03:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
shall that could be May
 
03:50:44.630 --> 03:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
so if so for example
 
03:50:44.640 --> 03:50:46.190 align:start position:0%
so if so for example
um

03:50:46.190 --> 03:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:48.530 --> 03:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
instead of shallots like one strike
 
03:50:51.410 --> 03:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
you're out you're gone and maybe it was
 
03:50:53.210 --> 03:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
just something as small as I got a bump
 
03:50:56.450 --> 03:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
on my arm and and I didn't report it you
 
03:50:57.830 --> 03:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
know the pharmacist didn't report it and
 
03:50:59.570 --> 03:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
Allison they've lost that seems pretty
 
03:51:02.330 --> 03:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
brutal I get that on the other hand
 
03:51:06.170 --> 03:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
not having any teeth also seems like a
 
03:51:08.990 --> 03:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
recipe for unreporting whereas if we
 
03:51:12.290 --> 03:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
change shell to May that would sort of
 
03:51:15.290 --> 03:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
put the ball in the court of whoever's
 
03:51:17.150 --> 03:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
making the decision and it'd be like hey
 
03:51:20.809 --> 03:51:20.819 align:start position:0%
look if if this was such an egregious
 
03:51:24.410 --> 03:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
um you know um event that it should have
 
03:51:26.330 --> 03:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
been really should have been reported of
 
03:51:28.370 --> 03:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
errors and wasn't then I could see there
 
03:51:30.170 --> 03:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
being a revocation there but if it's
 
03:51:31.570 --> 03:51:31.580 align:start position:0%
something small
 
03:51:33.550 --> 03:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know just a thought
 
03:51:35.809 --> 03:51:35.819 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman so I can clear up
 
03:51:38.269 --> 03:51:38.279 align:start position:0%
there's a little confusion on what needs
 
03:51:41.030 --> 03:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
to be reported and what doesn't so
 
03:51:43.250 --> 03:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
um undervares there are there are
 
03:51:47.150 --> 03:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
adverse effects that are considered
 
03:51:49.550 --> 03:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
um that you you should report but
 
03:51:50.870 --> 03:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
they're not legally required to be
 
03:51:53.630 --> 03:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
reported such as a low-grade fever
 
03:51:56.630 --> 03:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
um any new health condition temporarily
 
03:51:59.450 --> 03:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
associated with vaccination but what
 
03:52:01.429 --> 03:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
I've put here is I limited it to what's
 
03:52:02.990 --> 03:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
legally required under the federal law
 
03:52:05.929 --> 03:52:05.939 align:start position:0%
which does not have any penalty at all
 
03:52:10.130 --> 03:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
there is no enforcement of this anywhere
 
03:52:13.969 --> 03:52:13.979 align:start position:0%
um and so I I limited it to what is
 
03:52:15.769 --> 03:52:15.779 align:start position:0%
legally required and they are very
 
03:52:17.929 --> 03:52:17.939 align:start position:0%
specific there are tables on the HHS
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
website on the Veris website of
 
03:52:21.710 --> 03:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
reportable events these are things like
 
03:52:24.290 --> 03:52:24.300 align:start position:0%
yien Barre Syndrome
 
03:52:26.690 --> 03:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
um intussusception after a rotavirus
 
03:52:26.700 --> 03:52:28.550 align:start position:0%
um intussusception after a rotavirus
vaccine

03:52:28.550 --> 03:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
03:52:31.150 --> 03:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
um and Guillain-Barre is a paralysis
 
03:52:33.769 --> 03:52:33.779 align:start position:0%
paralyzing condition
 
03:52:35.290 --> 03:52:35.300 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
03:52:37.429 --> 03:52:37.439 align:start position:0%
cardiomyopathy or
 
03:52:39.889 --> 03:52:39.899 align:start position:0%
um uh cardio
 
03:52:43.070 --> 03:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
my myocarditis thank you after coveted
 
03:52:45.110 --> 03:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine that's listed in the table for
 
03:52:47.030 --> 03:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
reportable events for that so these are
 
03:52:48.469 --> 03:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
very specific and they're usually pretty
 
03:52:48.479 --> 03:52:49.849 align:start position:0%
very specific and they're usually pretty
severe

03:52:49.849 --> 03:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
severe
 
03:52:53.450 --> 03:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's not every little issue
 
03:52:55.190 --> 03:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
is going to be reported to Bears these
 
03:52:56.389 --> 03:52:56.399 align:start position:0%
are things that there really is no
 
03:52:58.550 --> 03:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
excuse for not reporting
 
03:52:58.560 --> 03:52:59.510 align:start position:0%
excuse for not reporting
um

03:52:59.510 --> 03:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:01.610 --> 03:53:01.620 align:start position:0%
to your question about the Shell versus
 
03:53:01.620 --> 03:53:02.929 align:start position:0%
to your question about the Shell versus
May

03:53:02.929 --> 03:53:02.939 align:start position:0%
May
 
03:53:02.939 --> 03:53:03.769 align:start position:0%
May
um

03:53:03.769 --> 03:53:03.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:08.389 --> 03:53:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh if if I had my colleagues support on
 
03:53:11.090 --> 03:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
that I'd I'd be okay with
 
03:53:13.790 --> 03:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
um you know bringing an amendment to say
 
03:53:18.889 --> 03:53:18.899 align:start position:0%
may instead next week but if not then
 
03:53:21.050 --> 03:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
um I I would like to push forward with
 
03:53:22.729 --> 03:53:22.739 align:start position:0%
this because
 
03:53:24.650 --> 03:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
um I think something just needs to be in
 
03:53:27.410 --> 03:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
the statute and uh we have no penalty I
 
03:53:29.510 --> 03:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't think that it's a crazy penalty
 
03:53:31.670 --> 03:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's you either administer them and and
 
03:53:33.530 --> 03:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
take all the responsibility with that
 
03:53:36.349 --> 03:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
authorization to administer them or you
 
03:53:38.269 --> 03:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
don't administer them
 
03:53:40.490 --> 03:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
um with the 60 days and I mean even
 
03:53:42.410 --> 03:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
having the revocation happen would
 
03:53:44.030 --> 03:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
require that the patient goes to the
 
03:53:47.030 --> 03:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
board and files a complaint and it has
 
03:53:48.610 --> 03:53:48.620 align:start position:0%
to be one of these more egregious
 
03:53:53.389 --> 03:53:53.399 align:start position:0%
adverse reactions and you know you would
 
03:53:55.370 --> 03:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
you went 60 days without doing it I
 
03:53:57.469 --> 03:53:57.479 align:start position:0%
think that that's a pretty
 
03:53:57.479 --> 03:53:58.010 align:start position:0%
think that that's a pretty
um

03:53:58.010 --> 03:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:01.849 --> 03:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
you know High bar to or it's a low bar
 
03:54:05.150 --> 03:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
you know to set for these farm for
 
03:54:06.950 --> 03:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
anyone administering something like this
 
03:54:06.960 --> 03:54:08.389 align:start position:0%
anyone administering something like this
so

03:54:08.389 --> 03:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:54:10.309 --> 03:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
I hope that clears some things up
 
03:54:13.070 --> 03:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
03:54:15.590 --> 03:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
having listened to the debate here as
 
03:54:17.210 --> 03:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
always in this committee I've learned a
 
03:54:18.410 --> 03:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
great deal
 
03:54:21.170 --> 03:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
um uh and much of which I agree with and
 
03:54:23.330 --> 03:54:23.340 align:start position:0%
and you know then we all come to
 
03:54:26.269 --> 03:54:26.279 align:start position:0%
different conclusions but that's okay uh
 
03:54:29.150 --> 03:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
I would like to just put forward a
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
process argument or a procedural
 
03:54:33.889 --> 03:54:33.899 align:start position:0%
argument and and a conceptual argument
 
03:54:36.010 --> 03:54:36.020 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:54:41.870 --> 03:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
rather than add this into one place with
 
03:54:43.670 --> 03:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
one profession
 
03:54:45.889 --> 03:54:45.899 align:start position:0%
and without
 
03:54:48.710 --> 03:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
feedback from the general public
 
03:54:48.720 --> 03:54:50.269 align:start position:0%
feedback from the general public
um

03:54:50.269 --> 03:54:50.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:54.530 --> 03:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be a better way to proceed
 
03:54:57.349 --> 03:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
if if what we're concerned about is the
 
03:54:59.330 --> 03:54:59.340 align:start position:0%
federal statute doesn't go far enough
 
03:55:01.010 --> 03:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
and doesn't have
 
03:55:02.929 --> 03:55:02.939 align:start position:0%
the sort of teeth that we might want to
 
03:55:02.939 --> 03:55:03.830 align:start position:0%
the sort of teeth that we might want to
see

03:55:03.830 --> 03:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:55:07.370 --> 03:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better to put in a new
 
03:55:08.889 --> 03:55:08.899 align:start position:0%
clean bill
 
03:55:12.830 --> 03:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh requiring this either with the shells
 
03:55:16.269 --> 03:55:16.279 align:start position:0%
or with the maze uh for all professions
 
03:55:19.910 --> 03:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
and let that get a vote up or down so
 
03:55:23.210 --> 03:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
that what we're doing is
 
03:55:26.689 --> 03:55:26.699 align:start position:0%
alerting everybody who administers these
 
03:55:28.750 --> 03:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
things in New Hampshire
 
03:55:31.630 --> 03:55:31.640 align:start position:0%
reminding them of their obligations
 
03:55:35.510 --> 03:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
rather than putting it on one small
 
03:55:38.330 --> 03:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
section and then having that robust
 
03:55:41.330 --> 03:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
debate about the shells in Maize because
 
03:55:43.250 --> 03:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
I would be more comfortable with May if
 
03:55:45.830 --> 03:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the shell online 12
 
03:55:50.170 --> 03:55:50.180 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the shells on line 11
 
03:55:53.150 --> 03:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
but if
 
03:55:55.849 --> 03:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
you just make it say may then you've
 
03:55:57.650 --> 03:55:57.660 align:start position:0%
taken all the teeth back out again and
 
03:56:00.050 --> 03:56:00.060 align:start position:0%
if teeth is what you want then you need
 
03:56:01.689 --> 03:56:01.699 align:start position:0%
shell rather than May
 
03:56:07.189 --> 03:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion would be that we pass
 
03:56:07.199 --> 03:56:08.090 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion would be that we pass
um

03:56:08.090 --> 03:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:11.330 --> 03:56:11.340 align:start position:0%
that we vote on well we can vote on the
 
03:56:13.550 --> 03:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
amendment obviously but my preference
 
03:56:16.849 --> 03:56:16.859 align:start position:0%
would be just to vote on SB 35 up or
 
03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
down and then decide
 
03:56:22.309 --> 03:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
um have a clean bill about the mayor's
 
03:56:26.150 --> 03:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
reporting that is consistent has been
 
03:56:28.729 --> 03:56:28.739 align:start position:0%
checked clearly against the federal
 
03:56:30.889 --> 03:56:30.899 align:start position:0%
statute so that we can all satisfy
 
03:56:33.170 --> 03:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
ourselves about that and then sets a
 
03:56:35.210 --> 03:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
policy that's the policy we want for New
 
03:56:36.469 --> 03:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and have it be set for
 
03:56:37.849 --> 03:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
everybody so you're basically
 
03:56:39.530 --> 03:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
recommending would draw the amendment
 
03:56:41.510 --> 03:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
and vote itl on the bill is that what
 
03:56:43.250 --> 03:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
you're talking about no I'm recommending
 
03:56:46.070 --> 03:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to vote no on the amendment
 
03:56:49.070 --> 03:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
and and I'm not going to vote for an IDL
 
03:56:51.050 --> 03:56:51.060 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote for not to pass oh
 
03:56:51.060 --> 03:56:52.189 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote for not to pass oh
okay

03:56:52.189 --> 03:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:56:54.349 --> 03:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
but that's that's a whole other question
 
03:56:56.630 --> 03:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
that we haven't gotten to yet okay
 
03:57:00.110 --> 03:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative Shapiro
 
03:57:01.969 --> 03:57:01.979 align:start position:0%
is something I don't know about but I
 
03:57:03.769 --> 03:57:03.779 align:start position:0%
feel like I've heard contradictory
 
03:57:06.170 --> 03:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
points of view about whether there's any
 
03:57:08.450 --> 03:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
consequences for not making a report
 
03:57:11.870 --> 03:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
um I've heard that there's no teeth the
 
03:57:13.969 --> 03:57:13.979 align:start position:0%
federal law does not have any specific
 
03:57:16.910 --> 03:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
consequences but I've heard also that
 
03:57:19.070 --> 03:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
the licensing boards
 
03:57:21.889 --> 03:57:21.899 align:start position:0%
require that people follow federal law
 
03:57:25.010 --> 03:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
and so that would be the place now
 
03:57:26.570 --> 03:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
whether it happens or not is a whole
 
03:57:30.590 --> 03:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
different question but but that would be
 
03:57:34.389 --> 03:57:34.399 align:start position:0%
the logical place and the actual place
 
03:57:36.769 --> 03:57:36.779 align:start position:0%
where someone could take a complaint
 
03:57:39.349 --> 03:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
saying I had an adverse reaction it was
 
03:57:42.110 --> 03:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
never reported and the licensing board
 
03:57:44.030 --> 03:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
would have jurisdiction
 
03:57:46.729 --> 03:57:46.739 align:start position:0%
to take some action on that with a
 
03:57:48.410 --> 03:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
physician or a
 
03:57:52.370 --> 03:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
pharmacy tech or a pharmacist or whoever
 
03:57:52.380 --> 03:57:53.150 align:start position:0%
pharmacy tech or a pharmacist or whoever
um

03:57:53.150 --> 03:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:56.030 --> 03:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
that's correct basically any licensing
 
03:57:59.389 --> 03:57:59.399 align:start position:0%
board I mean all professionals are
 
03:58:01.490 --> 03:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
required to follow federal and state law
 
03:58:03.889 --> 03:58:03.899 align:start position:0%
that's under their jurisdiction if
 
03:58:05.510 --> 03:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
you're not following the federal estate
 
03:58:07.969 --> 03:58:07.979 align:start position:0%
law and it's reported to the appropriate
 
03:58:10.910 --> 03:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
licensing board whatever that board is
 
03:58:12.590 --> 03:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
then it's up to the board at that point
 
03:58:14.210 --> 03:58:14.220 align:start position:0%
in time to take appropriate action
 
03:58:18.349 --> 03:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:20.150 --> 03:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
03:58:22.490 --> 03:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you so representative Merchant so
 
03:58:25.070 --> 03:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
even if the federal law does not have
 
03:58:28.370 --> 03:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
teeth in it the fact that somebody would
 
03:58:30.229 --> 03:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
be going before the board for not
 
03:58:32.630 --> 03:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
complying with the federal law they
 
03:58:35.750 --> 03:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
could still lose their licensure related
 
03:58:39.050 --> 03:58:39.060 align:start position:0%
to that yes and it's not just true with
 
03:58:41.030 --> 03:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
vaccines it's true a lot of federal laws
 
03:58:43.130 --> 03:58:43.140 align:start position:0%
if you look at things to do with
 
03:58:44.809 --> 03:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
controlled substance for instance and if
 
03:58:46.969 --> 03:58:46.979 align:start position:0%
you're as a pharmacist dispensing
 
03:58:48.170 --> 03:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
something that you shouldn't have
 
03:58:50.150 --> 03:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
dispensed there's nothing in the federal
 
03:58:51.889 --> 03:58:51.899 align:start position:0%
law that's going to come after you it's
 
03:58:53.389 --> 03:58:53.399 align:start position:0%
going to come down to the State Board of
 
03:58:55.309 --> 03:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy because they're the ones that
 
03:58:59.090 --> 03:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
control your license so anytime at least
 
03:59:01.309 --> 03:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
in Pharmacy I can speak to have been on
 
03:59:03.889 --> 03:59:03.899 align:start position:0%
the board if there is a licensed
 
03:59:05.269 --> 03:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
individual out there
 
03:59:07.130 --> 03:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
who is not following the appropriate
 
03:59:08.630 --> 03:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
federal state law
 
03:59:10.189 --> 03:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
then the Board of Pharmacy under
 
03:59:12.530 --> 03:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction has the ability to
 
03:59:14.689 --> 03:59:14.699 align:start position:0%
discipline the individual up to the
 
03:59:17.510 --> 03:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
point of taking the license away
 
03:59:18.889 --> 03:59:18.899 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:59:21.229 --> 03:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so I think you know
 
03:59:23.210 --> 03:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
having listened to some really awesome
 
03:59:26.210 --> 03:59:26.220 align:start position:0%
discussion I'm kind of at a place where
 
03:59:28.130 --> 03:59:28.140 align:start position:0%
just looking at the administrative
 
03:59:31.010 --> 03:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
consequences of the amendment I I
 
03:59:32.630 --> 03:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't want to support this
 
03:59:34.790 --> 03:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
particular Amendment but I think that
 
03:59:36.950 --> 03:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman is bringing up
 
03:59:40.070 --> 03:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know some very valid concerns
 
03:59:42.650 --> 03:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
um I think at the heart of it is in the
 
03:59:44.510 --> 03:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
fact that theirs is not being complied
 
03:59:46.370 --> 03:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
with and there has to be some teeth
 
03:59:50.150 --> 03:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere and more so I think as we
 
03:59:52.670 --> 03:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
become more fragmented I know when I was
 
03:59:55.250 --> 03:59:55.260 align:start position:0%
a kid my doctor gave me every vaccine
 
03:59:57.410 --> 03:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
and as it becomes more and more
 
04:00:00.530 --> 04:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
fragmented there has to be we have to
 
04:00:02.150 --> 04:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
find a way to get some structure because
 
04:00:03.710 --> 04:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
maybe it's because people aren't
 
04:00:05.750 --> 04:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
notifying on their own or maybe it's
 
04:00:06.889 --> 04:00:06.899 align:start position:0%
just because the person who's
 
04:00:09.050 --> 04:00:09.060 align:start position:0%
administrating never has that
 
04:00:11.269 --> 04:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to follow up
 
04:00:13.610 --> 04:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
um so I think you know we need to look
 
04:00:16.250 --> 04:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
at that but maybe not this amendment at
 
04:00:19.790 --> 04:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
this time representative balazov uh
 
04:00:23.269 --> 04:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I still think this
 
04:00:27.469 --> 04:00:27.479 align:start position:0%
amendment is a good thing as a written
 
04:00:32.210 --> 04:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
uh the underlying bill has some uh very
 
04:00:36.110 --> 04:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
concerning uh effects with bringing uh
 
04:00:39.229 --> 04:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
um a civilization for uh in certain
 
04:00:43.070 --> 04:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
context for this new vaccine and we
 
04:00:46.370 --> 04:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
received online testimony at the
 
04:00:50.269 --> 04:00:50.279 align:start position:0%
guardian a severe reactions to RSV
 
04:00:54.130 --> 04:00:54.140 align:start position:0%
vaccines that can include paralyzing
 
04:00:54.140 --> 04:00:55.689 align:start position:0%
vaccines that can include paralyzing
effects

04:00:55.689 --> 04:00:55.699 align:start position:0%
effects
 
04:00:55.699 --> 04:00:57.250 align:start position:0%
effects
and

04:00:57.250 --> 04:00:57.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:59.830 --> 04:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
if somebody
 
04:01:02.630 --> 04:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
repeatedly to because it's probably a
 
04:01:05.650 --> 04:01:05.660 align:start position:0%
little bit Advanced that somebody is not
 
04:01:08.870 --> 04:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
reporting uh those severe effects for
 
04:01:12.650 --> 04:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
example for some batch of this uh of
 
04:01:16.030 --> 04:01:16.040 align:start position:0%
That vaccine so
 
04:01:21.189 --> 04:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
permanent suspension just for one person
 
04:01:24.429 --> 04:01:24.439 align:start position:0%
who doesn't teleport it I don't think
 
04:01:28.370 --> 04:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
it's too much because as was said like
 
04:01:32.689 --> 04:01:32.699 align:start position:0%
some other jobs that pharmacy tech could
 
04:01:34.150 --> 04:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
be doing
 
04:01:37.969 --> 04:01:37.979 align:start position:0%
it's a unfair situation for provided but
 
04:01:42.110 --> 04:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
we need to think about clients as well
 
04:01:45.830 --> 04:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
and like there was some scenario about
 
04:01:50.510 --> 04:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
like small bumper but for example if we
 
04:01:54.130 --> 04:01:54.140 align:start position:0%
took at a wireless database
 
04:01:58.570 --> 04:01:58.580 align:start position:0%
2038 to 120 report
 
04:02:02.389 --> 04:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
a client had severe nausea and vomiting
 
04:02:05.570 --> 04:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
from five minutes post injections and
 
04:02:08.150 --> 04:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
for the next eight to ten hours so if
 
04:02:10.130 --> 04:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
something happens in five minutes
 
04:02:13.269 --> 04:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
there's a good chance that a pharmacists
 
04:02:17.150 --> 04:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
would have seen it but instead it was
 
04:02:22.150 --> 04:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
not reported so time came and that
 
04:02:25.450 --> 04:02:25.460 align:start position:0%
patient was administered second dose
 
04:02:31.210 --> 04:02:31.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:34.790 --> 04:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
and vomiting for five minutes uh post
 
04:02:38.450 --> 04:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
vaccination 100 degree fever severe
 
04:02:41.809 --> 04:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
stomachache no bowel movements since the
 
04:02:44.570 --> 04:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
day before vaccination for three days in
 
04:02:48.530 --> 04:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
total and ultimately that client died so
 
04:02:52.130 --> 04:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
I would say if the first reaction would
 
04:02:55.550 --> 04:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
be reported that client would be saved
 
04:02:57.710 --> 04:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
and maybe other clients would be saved
 
04:03:01.490 --> 04:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
so yeah yes it's harsh for providers but
 
04:03:04.790 --> 04:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
I think we need it for clients thank you
 
04:03:06.410 --> 04:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative King you had your hand up
 
04:03:07.849 --> 04:03:07.859 align:start position:0%
are you all set
 
04:03:10.269 --> 04:03:10.279 align:start position:0%
okay any other debate any other
 
04:03:12.349 --> 04:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
04:03:17.170 --> 04:03:17.180 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clarify I don't think
 
04:03:20.929 --> 04:03:20.939 align:start position:0%
you don't research Theirs to see if a
 
04:03:23.389 --> 04:03:23.399 align:start position:0%
specific person has had a reaction so
 
04:03:25.790 --> 04:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
that's not the purpose of theirs it's to
 
04:03:28.849 --> 04:03:28.859 align:start position:0%
collect a broad spectrum of public
 
04:03:31.610 --> 04:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
health information so that we know
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
that whole range of possible effects so
 
04:03:41.090 --> 04:03:41.100 align:start position:0%
that but it's not intended to be a a
 
04:03:43.849 --> 04:03:43.859 align:start position:0%
protection for an individual I just
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that we were clear
 
04:03:46.070 --> 04:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
on that
 
04:03:48.530 --> 04:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant I would say to
 
04:03:50.570 --> 04:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
this committee it's a lot of good
 
04:03:52.250 --> 04:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
discussion going on
 
04:03:53.929 --> 04:03:53.939 align:start position:0%
and touched upon some really important
 
04:03:53.939 --> 04:03:55.670 align:start position:0%
and touched upon some really important
things

04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:03:57.170 --> 04:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
if we're really concerned to
 
04:03:59.389 --> 04:03:59.399 align:start position:0%
representative palazzo's concern about
 
04:04:01.189 --> 04:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
the patient and getting down to that
 
04:04:02.450 --> 04:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
level one of the things for us to
 
04:04:04.490 --> 04:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
consider is that not only do we put the
 
04:04:06.590 --> 04:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
information into the Bears program but
 
04:04:08.030 --> 04:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
put it in the vaccine registration
 
04:04:09.229 --> 04:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
because that's where most people are
 
04:04:11.809 --> 04:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
going to go look for it so the point is
 
04:04:14.330 --> 04:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
I would say that information should go
 
04:04:16.189 --> 04:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
into vaccine registry
 
04:04:17.990 --> 04:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
so that when the pharmacist is giving
 
04:04:20.210 --> 04:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
the subsequent one
 
04:04:22.729 --> 04:04:22.739 align:start position:0%
that information is in that vaccine
 
04:04:25.429 --> 04:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
registry which is what I need
 
04:04:27.530 --> 04:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
intervage doesn't help me so I go back
 
04:04:28.969 --> 04:04:28.979 align:start position:0%
and say the same thing is that we
 
04:04:30.530 --> 04:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
probably should be thinking about this
 
04:04:33.650 --> 04:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
in a broader sense in having the
 
04:04:36.590 --> 04:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
information prevares go into the vaccine
 
04:04:39.349 --> 04:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
registry and all professionals report it
 
04:04:42.170 --> 04:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
in that Arena so therefore we all have
 
04:04:44.030 --> 04:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
access to it to protect the patient
 
04:04:45.710 --> 04:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
because ultimately at the end of the day
 
04:04:47.689 --> 04:04:47.699 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to do but if we
 
04:04:50.750 --> 04:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
don't have access to the information we
 
04:04:52.969 --> 04:04:52.979 align:start position:0%
can't do that so I would go back and
 
04:04:55.189 --> 04:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
saying let's talk about a bill
 
04:04:58.370 --> 04:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
subsequent to this that all
 
04:05:00.410 --> 04:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
professionals who give vaccines
 
04:05:02.150 --> 04:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
have the requirement to put it in the
 
04:05:03.889 --> 04:05:03.899 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry so that everyone can
 
04:05:05.389 --> 04:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
benefit from it as well as the patient
 
04:05:05.399 --> 04:05:08.330 align:start position:0%
benefit from it as well as the patient
ultimately

04:05:08.330 --> 04:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:11.450 --> 04:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:13.790 --> 04:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
04:05:16.189 --> 04:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
um it is part of what goes into the
 
04:05:18.910 --> 04:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry to report adverse
 
04:05:22.070 --> 04:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination events not necessarily that
 
04:05:24.889 --> 04:05:24.899 align:start position:0%
you filed a varus report but there is a
 
04:05:27.290 --> 04:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
place for that too already
 
04:05:31.490 --> 04:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:33.769 --> 04:05:33.779 align:start position:0%
no I don't know what it is it just says
 
04:05:35.389 --> 04:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
you had an event doesn't tell what the
 
04:05:38.689 --> 04:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
event was it was my mild fever and so
 
04:05:40.429 --> 04:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
forth but I think that's where we should
 
04:05:42.950 --> 04:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
focus our attention on is getting as
 
04:05:44.630 --> 04:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
much information into the registry as
 
04:05:46.610 --> 04:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
possible so that we can be as conclusive
 
04:05:48.650 --> 04:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
to help the professionals out who are
 
04:05:50.450 --> 04:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
helping the patient ultimately to
 
04:05:50.460 --> 04:05:51.710 align:start position:0%
helping the patient ultimately to
prevent

04:05:51.710 --> 04:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
04:05:53.809 --> 04:05:53.819 align:start position:0%
dire situations so the patient
 
04:05:55.550 --> 04:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman representative
 
04:06:00.370 --> 04:06:00.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:08.150 --> 04:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:10.309 --> 04:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
oh yeah are you really want to hear what
 
04:06:13.070 --> 04:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
I'm saying don't you so I I think it's
 
04:06:15.290 --> 04:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
an incredibly important discussion and
 
04:06:17.389 --> 04:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
it's so important that I don't feel
 
04:06:19.309 --> 04:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
comfortable to make a decision on this
 
04:06:22.189 --> 04:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
right now I I think that um
 
04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
that we need to vote on it yeah but I
 
04:06:26.570 --> 04:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
really think that this warrants a bunch
 
04:06:28.490 --> 04:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
of people coming together talking about
 
04:06:31.250 --> 04:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
it working out the pros and cons an ad
 
04:06:35.410 --> 04:06:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:39.290 --> 04:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm actually proposing that I
 
04:06:41.689 --> 04:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
think it's a great idea and I I think
 
04:06:43.250 --> 04:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
that this is incredibly important
 
04:06:44.809 --> 04:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
discussion with far-reaching
 
04:06:47.090 --> 04:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
consequences and I just find it
 
04:06:48.769 --> 04:06:48.779 align:start position:0%
entertaining that this started out with
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
a relatively very simple I hate to use
 
04:06:53.210 --> 04:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
words simple or common sense because
 
04:06:55.849 --> 04:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
those don't mean anything to me but um
 
04:06:58.010 --> 04:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
bill but I think you started a great
 
04:06:59.750 --> 04:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
discussion that really needs to keep
 
04:07:02.210 --> 04:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
going and there are parts of this
 
04:07:03.889 --> 04:07:03.899 align:start position:0%
amendment that I really don't like
 
04:07:06.590 --> 04:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
specifically the penalty part I think
 
04:07:08.570 --> 04:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
that needs a lot of work
 
04:07:09.769 --> 04:07:09.779 align:start position:0%
um I agree that there needs to be
 
04:07:11.269 --> 04:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
consequences but I think they've gone
 
04:07:12.830 --> 04:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
too far
 
04:07:15.050 --> 04:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
um but the but your idea is awesome it's
 
04:07:17.030 --> 04:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
amazing and it warrants a committee of
 
04:07:23.929 --> 04:07:23.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:27.050 --> 04:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
I usually don't have trouble making a
 
04:07:30.110 --> 04:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
decision on something I read it and go
 
04:07:34.130 --> 04:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
and this one frightens me I mean I agree
 
04:07:35.870 --> 04:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
with everything you said about how
 
04:07:37.729 --> 04:07:37.739 align:start position:0%
important it is
 
04:07:41.870 --> 04:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
um that adverse reactions be uh reported
 
04:07:45.650 --> 04:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
where they can be accessed and I I
 
04:07:48.410 --> 04:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
admire you for bringing this forward I
 
04:07:51.110 --> 04:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
just I I'm really I'm thinking about
 
04:07:52.790 --> 04:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
like leaving the room so I don't have to
 
04:07:54.290 --> 04:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
vote on this
 
04:07:57.349 --> 04:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
um but I would like an ad hoc or further
 
04:07:59.809 --> 04:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
study and I'd like to just pass the bill
 
04:07:59.819 --> 04:08:01.250 align:start position:0%
study and I'd like to just pass the bill
but

04:08:01.250 --> 04:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:08:06.530 --> 04:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:09.469 --> 04:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
um what work on an ad hoc committee to
 
04:08:11.809 --> 04:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
to bring up reporting
 
04:08:14.929 --> 04:08:14.939 align:start position:0%
um during last year the year before I
 
04:08:17.570 --> 04:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
got to watch 400 people receive vaccines
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
in a facility that I worked at a
 
04:08:22.910 --> 04:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
non-medical and one had an adverse
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
reaction which you know we had a
 
04:08:28.189 --> 04:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
15-minute waiting area and then somebody
 
04:08:29.990 --> 04:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
nudged me and said that fella over there
 
04:08:31.550 --> 04:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
looks like he's passed out he's
 
04:08:33.830 --> 04:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
incoherent and he's sweating and so we
 
04:08:36.469 --> 04:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
got the nurse staff to go so you know
 
04:08:38.150 --> 04:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
they do happen
 
04:08:39.830 --> 04:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:08:43.490 --> 04:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know but I mean I passed
 
04:08:45.170 --> 04:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
it off to the medical professionals
 
04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
right you know because I can't have him
 
04:08:49.849 --> 04:08:49.859 align:start position:0%
draw his symptoms away
 
04:08:52.010 --> 04:08:52.020 align:start position:0%
um not those symptoms I'm an art
 
04:08:53.689 --> 04:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
therapist anyway
 
04:08:55.250 --> 04:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:08:57.889 --> 04:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to vote down your Amendment
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
but hope that we do indeed uh
 
04:09:04.370 --> 04:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
go forward with some kind of a committee
 
04:09:07.429 --> 04:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
and that it applies to all professions
 
04:09:09.650 --> 04:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
that are giving out and especially as
 
04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're hearing that other bill in the
 
04:09:14.570 --> 04:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
future about another group of medical
 
04:09:18.830 --> 04:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
people that want to give out vaccines we
 
04:09:21.229 --> 04:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
need accountability
 
04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
sorry I went on a bit long but
 
04:09:24.650 --> 04:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
04:09:27.349 --> 04:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
I just want to say that I think if we if
 
04:09:28.910 --> 04:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
there are further discussions they
 
04:09:32.210 --> 04:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
should really be dual discussions about
 
04:09:34.610 --> 04:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
um where information about the adverse
 
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
reaction can go that um could be seen by
 
04:09:37.560 --> 04:09:39.830 align:start position:0%
reaction can go that um could be seen by
Future

04:09:39.830 --> 04:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
Future
 
04:09:39.840 --> 04:09:41.809 align:start position:0%
Future
um

04:09:41.809 --> 04:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:44.030 --> 04:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
um clinicians or who has ever given
 
04:09:48.130 --> 04:09:48.140 align:start position:0%
future shots but also that that somehow
 
04:09:51.050 --> 04:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
reporting to theirs is encouraged
 
04:09:51.060 --> 04:09:52.010 align:start position:0%
reporting to theirs is encouraged
because

04:09:52.010 --> 04:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:09:52.020 --> 04:09:52.550 align:start position:0%
because
um

04:09:52.550 --> 04:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:55.010 --> 04:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
you know like I said my experience was
 
04:09:55.020 --> 04:09:56.630 align:start position:0%
you know like I said my experience was
that

04:09:56.630 --> 04:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:00.650 --> 04:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
it was kind of ho-hum you know like
 
04:10:02.689 --> 04:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
I I didn't get the impression at least
 
04:10:04.910 --> 04:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
from my very limited experience that
 
04:10:08.630 --> 04:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
everyone was making those reports
 
04:10:10.729 --> 04:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
another discussion
 
04:10:13.189 --> 04:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
representative McLean thank you Mr chair
 
04:10:15.110 --> 04:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
I just want to say looking at the
 
04:10:17.210 --> 04:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
significant list of co-sponsors on this
 
04:10:17.220 --> 04:10:18.170 align:start position:0%
significant list of co-sponsors on this
thing

04:10:18.170 --> 04:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:10:21.469 --> 04:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
um you know I I have enormous uh respect
 
04:10:24.170 --> 04:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
for that and also for the intention
 
04:10:26.570 --> 04:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
behind this thing but I do think that
 
04:10:29.330 --> 04:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
the amendment does need more input
 
04:10:32.929 --> 04:10:32.939 align:start position:0%
before it can go ahead and so like I
 
04:10:34.849 --> 04:10:34.859 align:start position:0%
said in spite of all the respect I have
 
04:10:37.130 --> 04:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
for the co-sponsors I just can't support
 
04:10:38.750 --> 04:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
it at this time
 
04:10:41.090 --> 04:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
representative alberger thank you Mr
 
04:10:43.429 --> 04:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
chair and given that I'm not a member of
 
04:10:45.710 --> 04:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
the committee I do hope that if some
 
04:10:48.229 --> 04:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
group is formed to discuss this that it
 
04:10:51.650 --> 04:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
be very clear that if someone like me as
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
a patient chooses not to report uh any
 
04:10:59.210 --> 04:10:59.220 align:start position:0%
kind of adverse reaction that nobody uh
 
04:11:02.090 --> 04:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
whether a pharmacist or a nurse or a
 
04:11:04.490 --> 04:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
doctor gets held responsible for my
 
04:11:07.550 --> 04:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
decision to not report
 
04:11:10.070 --> 04:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel I just wanted to
 
04:11:11.689 --> 04:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
make one more point that maybe a little
 
04:11:13.849 --> 04:11:13.859 align:start position:0%
bit more General than specific but it
 
04:11:16.729 --> 04:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
does it's germane to this so a couple
 
04:11:18.229 --> 04:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
years ago I was involved in the
 
04:11:19.309 --> 04:11:19.319 align:start position:0%
development of a thing called the
 
04:11:21.469 --> 04:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
national pain strategy so we went met in
 
04:11:23.210 --> 04:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
Washington to develop this thing and
 
04:11:25.330 --> 04:11:25.340 align:start position:0%
there were 200 people in the room
 
04:11:28.010 --> 04:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
sitting around talking about this and
 
04:11:29.990 --> 04:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
they started bringing up points that
 
04:11:32.510 --> 04:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
were totally inappropriate for clinical
 
04:11:35.630 --> 04:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
practice and so I finally raised my guns
 
04:11:37.610 --> 04:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
questioned my hand and I asked how many
 
04:11:38.929 --> 04:11:38.939 align:start position:0%
of you guys are actually clinical
 
04:11:41.570 --> 04:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
doctors not one person in the room
 
04:11:43.670 --> 04:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
except me was a clinical doctor and then
 
04:11:45.830 --> 04:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
I proceeded to tell them why this won't
 
04:11:45.840 --> 04:11:46.670 align:start position:0%
I proceeded to tell them why this won't
work

04:11:46.670 --> 04:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
one of my big concerns about this that I
 
04:11:51.469 --> 04:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
think needs to be worked on is I'm not
 
04:11:54.530 --> 04:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
convinced it's enforceable so um like
 
04:11:56.809 --> 04:11:56.819 align:start position:0%
you know you say you told blah blah blah
 
04:11:58.670 --> 04:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
I had it well there's no record of that
 
04:12:00.590 --> 04:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
so how do you enforce it and then my
 
04:12:02.570 --> 04:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
other big concern from having dealt with
 
04:12:05.269 --> 04:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
the medical board
 
04:12:07.370 --> 04:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
sometimes the medical board makes good
 
04:12:10.010 --> 04:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
decisions and sometimes they don't and a
 
04:12:11.689 --> 04:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
lot of it's the characters that are on
 
04:12:13.670 --> 04:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
the medical board or the I'm sure the
 
04:12:15.110 --> 04:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy when Gary was there
 
04:12:16.550 --> 04:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
was always I'm sorry representative
 
04:12:19.790 --> 04:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
Merchant was always perfect but the
 
04:12:22.729 --> 04:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
enforce ability was a concern to me also
 
04:12:25.969 --> 04:12:25.979 align:start position:0%
um but I just it needs to get worked on
 
04:12:27.650 --> 04:12:27.660 align:start position:0%
and it needs to have the voice of
 
04:12:30.229 --> 04:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
clinicians involved in developing it
 
04:12:33.530 --> 04:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
um otherwise it won't be enforceable
 
04:12:35.450 --> 04:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
any other discussion
 
04:12:38.210 --> 04:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
I think we've pretty well discussed it
 
04:12:39.830 --> 04:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
pretty thoroughly
 
04:12:41.389 --> 04:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:12:43.790 --> 04:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
um since we're ready to vote
 
04:12:46.610 --> 04:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the clerk to call the wall
 
04:12:49.070 --> 04:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
a vote is on Amendment

effects from these vaccines and it's
 
04:14:56.710 --> 04:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
being new it's not sufficiently uh
 
04:15:00.110 --> 04:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
investigated we know that at least one
 
04:15:04.250 --> 04:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
of the uh Pride uses uh has a long
 
04:15:06.370 --> 04:15:06.380 align:start position:0%
history of not
 
04:15:10.070 --> 04:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
properly reporting side effects on a
 
04:15:13.910 --> 04:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
timely manner so it's a big concern for
 
04:15:16.309 --> 04:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
me and second I don't know how many
 
04:15:19.010 --> 04:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
constituents contacted you saying that
 
04:15:21.130 --> 04:15:21.140 align:start position:0%
they wanted but
 
04:15:21.140 --> 04:15:22.809 align:start position:0%
they wanted but
like

04:15:22.809 --> 04:15:22.819 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:15:26.090 --> 04:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
I had contacts from people who want to
 
04:15:29.330 --> 04:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
administer it but I haven't heard like
 
04:15:32.510 --> 04:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
about any emergency when we need to
 
04:15:35.750 --> 04:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
hurry up and have this vaccine so for
 
04:15:38.590 --> 04:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
this reasons I think we need to move
 
04:15:41.330 --> 04:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
cautiously and I will be voting against
 
04:15:43.610 --> 04:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
this time
 
04:15:46.189 --> 04:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
thank you any other discussion the
 
04:15:47.870 --> 04:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
04:15:52.130 --> 04:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
well I just I just kind of wanted to
 
04:15:52.140 --> 04:15:52.670 align:start position:0%
well I just I just kind of wanted to
um

04:15:52.670 --> 04:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:55.250 --> 04:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
address some of the concerns expressed
 
04:15:57.110 --> 04:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
by representative palazzov and I think
 
04:15:59.150 --> 04:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
that he he makes very good points about
 
04:16:01.370 --> 04:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
this is this is new we don't know a lot
 
04:16:02.530 --> 04:16:02.540 align:start position:0%
about it
 
04:16:06.590 --> 04:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand if if we believe
 
04:16:10.490 --> 04:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
in personal choice and as we saw with
 
04:16:12.769 --> 04:16:12.779 align:start position:0%
the covet vaccines there were people who
 
04:16:14.570 --> 04:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
were very skeptical of them and rightly
 
04:16:16.849 --> 04:16:16.859 align:start position:0%
so there were people who wanted them
 
04:16:19.010 --> 04:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
very much and wanted them right away and
 
04:16:19.020 --> 04:16:21.189 align:start position:0%
very much and wanted them right away and
uh

04:16:21.189 --> 04:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:16:24.650 --> 04:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
just allowing it to be administered in
 
04:16:26.689 --> 04:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
this fashion is a convenience for people
 
04:16:28.910 --> 04:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
who want it but it doesn't
 
04:16:31.969 --> 04:16:31.979 align:start position:0%
compel anybody who has any reservation
 
04:16:31.979 --> 04:16:33.650 align:start position:0%
compel anybody who has any reservation
whatsoever

04:16:33.650 --> 04:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
04:16:37.070 --> 04:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
to Avail themselves of it so I see it as
 
04:16:39.889 --> 04:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
as being something that's offered as a
 
04:16:43.130 --> 04:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
service to our constituents and none of
 
04:16:46.250 --> 04:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
our constituents have to actually do it
 
04:16:49.070 --> 04:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
if they don't want to do it so I will be
 
04:16:51.229 --> 04:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
voting in favor of the ought to pass but
 
04:16:56.330 --> 04:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
I I do understand the concerns about
 
04:16:57.889 --> 04:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:17:00.349 --> 04:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
how much do we know and do people want
 
04:17:02.389 --> 04:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
this or not but those who don't want it
 
04:17:05.809 --> 04:17:05.819 align:start position:0%
have the option not to have it
 
04:17:08.809 --> 04:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
other representative of a cop
 
04:17:10.610 --> 04:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman so I will be
 
04:17:12.830 --> 04:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
voting uh in favor of the ought to pass
 
04:17:18.410 --> 04:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
motion I see this as a uh a question of
 
04:17:20.570 --> 04:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
um well I'll call it deregulation which
 
04:17:22.070 --> 04:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
is to say
 
04:17:25.729 --> 04:17:25.739 align:start position:0%
um if if a uh if an adult has given
 
04:17:27.469 --> 04:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
consent that they want to receive the
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
vaccine we ought to have a least
 
04:17:33.349 --> 04:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
restrictive approach to
 
04:17:35.330 --> 04:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
um to allowing people to administer That
 
04:17:38.750 --> 04:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine in a way that is
 
04:17:41.889 --> 04:17:41.899 align:start position:0%
as safe as it would be if it were
 
04:17:44.570 --> 04:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
administered by anyone who is permitted
 
04:17:46.910 --> 04:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
to do so today I will also point out
 
04:17:49.510 --> 04:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
that the the statute already
 
04:17:54.769 --> 04:17:54.779 align:start position:0%
permits the administration of a a wide
 
04:17:56.929 --> 04:17:56.939 align:start position:0%
range of vaccines this one simply adds
 
04:17:59.990 --> 04:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
RSV to that list so I will be voting uh
 
04:18:01.910 --> 04:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
in favor of this
 
04:18:04.250 --> 04:18:04.260 align:start position:0%

forward so we can make sure that as we

04:21:59.889 --> 04:21:59.899 align:start position:0%
quick and easy called Medicaid expansion
 
04:22:02.689 --> 04:22:02.699 align:start position:0%
probably take just a few minutes but uh
 
04:22:05.150 --> 04:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
actually probably more than a few but uh
