00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
okay I'm waiting for a couple of our
 
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
members especially one of them has to
 
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:12.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.100 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call the finance committee
 
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
to order for an exec session
 
00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
on a group of bills mostly from division
 
00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:23.390 align:start position:0%
on a group of bills mostly from division
one

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
so I will Begin by recognizing
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman before I get too
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
far into this I just want to thank the
 
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
members of division one we had something
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
like 26 bills initially we dispense with
 
00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:44.599 align:start position:0%
some earlier we have I think 17 today
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
the work done by the division members
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
has been extremely good helpful and
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
we've come to a lot of good decisions I
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
think so
 
00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
moving to the first bill House Bill 46
 
00:07:59.930 --> 00:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study
 
00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:01.979 align:start position:0%
replace the replacement of a bail
 
00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:04.759 align:start position:0%
commissioner with a court magistrate
 
00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:08.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
thank you do we have this amendment
 
00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:18.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:25.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman's got one for you if you
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
didn't get it
 
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.529 align:start position:0%
didn't get it
too

00:08:36.529 --> 00:08:36.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
it was moved by representative McGuire
 
00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:41.459 align:start position:0%
and seconded by representative
 
00:08:41.459 --> 00:08:45.670 align:start position:0%
and seconded by representative
cambrell's

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
well but what I see in front of me is 9
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
15 h
 
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
all right so I guess the paper I'm
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
looking at isn't right okay
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much Mr chairman so uh
 
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
this this bill uh the previous go around
 
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
removed the financial aspects so this is
 
00:09:20.449 --> 00:09:20.459 align:start position:0%
now just a committee
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
um so it seems reasonable to to say off
 
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:25.110 align:start position:0%
the pass
 
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.730 align:start position:0%
the pass
[Music]

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.329 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:26.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:26.339 --> 00:09:27.829 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:30.910 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
I personally think we don't want to
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
replace bail Commissioners but that's
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
just my personal opinion and why not let
 
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
the committee do what it wants to do is
 
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
is the amendment you're moving 9 15.
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
I guess so yeah on my paper it said 892h
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
but what I have in my hand is 9 15h
 
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll ask
 
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.850 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll ask
um

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
I actually get an explanation the
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
amendment approved by the division it
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
was 915h
 
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
and it just made grammatical changes to
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh the bill
 
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:08.700 align:start position:0%
yeah there was like a wrong comma or
 
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
something like that okay
 
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
so did you move the amendment yes 915
 
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.470 align:start position:0%
so did you move the amendment yes 915
nature

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
nature
 
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
and representative Ambrose you want a
 
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.170 align:start position:0%
and representative Ambrose you want a
second

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion tell us what your
 
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
amendment was
 
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
attempting to do yeah this amendment
 
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
again is it's just a grammatical
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
correction that's all
 
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:39.140 align:start position:0%
the com the bill itself in the previous
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
committee amended out any Financial
 
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
aspects and so therefore this is just a
 
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
committee and for some of the confusion
 
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
I think we have more than one Amendment
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
before us
 
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
one applies to another bill
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
the one on the top it looks like is is
 
00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
uh to 46 the one second pages to
 
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
Amendment 576 which we haven't come to
 
00:11:00.839 --> 00:11:01.670 align:start position:0%
Amendment 576 which we haven't come to
yet

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
so we've got two amendments stabled
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
together the one we're going to look at
 
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.490 align:start position:0%
together the one we're going to look at
is

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:10.019 align:start position:0%
zero nine one five you'll see how simple
 
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:23.569 --> 00:11:23.579 align:start position:0%
changes the one line
 
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
can we adopt by a show of hands
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
without objection all in favor
 
00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
hands down any opposed
 
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
we have adopted the amendment
 
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire now moves I ought
 
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
to pass with Amendment
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative Campbell seconds
 
00:11:53.449 --> 00:11:53.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney thank you Mr
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you division one for
 
00:11:59.329 --> 00:11:59.339 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward I certainly
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
respect the recommendation but I do just
 
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
want to explain I'll be voting no I have
 
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
a constituent who's a bail commissioner
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
she and I have had many of discussion
 
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
with regards to this conversion of bail
 
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
commissioner to magistrate I know also
 
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
there was a bill retained in criminal
 
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
justice this year House Bill 318 to
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
study this conversion as well and then
 
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
just in general the idea of a committee
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
on top of all the other work the
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
legislature has to do with regards to
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
this would be my reasons for voting no
 
00:12:35.569 --> 00:12:35.579 align:start position:0%
or not to pass with Amendment House Bill
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
seeing none are you ready for the
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
question well excuse me representative
 
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
Hewitt for a question yes um
 
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit confused here I've got
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
people two pieces of paper yeah the
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
first one uh on the the front one says
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative leishman Hillsborough 33
 
00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:05.459 align:start position:0%
and it's an amendment to House Bill 46
 
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
FN that's what we're talking about
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
and the only thing about House Bill 46
 
00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
is the same number that's over here I
 
00:13:16.329 --> 00:13:16.339 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
is it immensely bill by replacing the
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
introductory paragraph with the
 
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
following which is three of the duties
 
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
of the committee is to evaluate whether
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner should be replaced
 
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.470 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner should be replaced
um

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
and then on the on the next page
 
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
um we have an amendment to House Bill
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
576 FN
 
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
um apparently from representative
 
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.350 align:start position:0%
um apparently from representative
Sweeney

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
Sweeney
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know what's going on except that
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the beginning when God made the
 
00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
little bills
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
um we had a bill that had been in that
 
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
had been introduced to abolish uh bail
 
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and replace them with uh
 
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
something else I think I think it was
 
00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:04.519 align:start position:0%
magic uh
 
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
magistrates of some sort
 
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
uh the problem is that it didn't go over
 
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
very well with with the people out in
 
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
the field including representative
 
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:16.700 align:start position:0%
Mooney's of
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
Representative Mooney's uh
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
constituent and
 
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
also didn't go over very well with the
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
anybody representing the district court
 
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.329 align:start position:0%
anybody representing the district court
system

00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:14:29.339 --> 00:14:30.050 align:start position:0%
system
um

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
the reason is that
 
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
the the provisions of the bill that was
 
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
was offered in the beginning
 
00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
created a little bit of a problem in
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
that it just completely turned around
 
00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
how the criminal justice system works in
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
terms of the arrest and prosecution of
 
00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:53.650 align:start position:0%
terms of the arrest and prosecution of
defendants

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:53.660 align:start position:0%
defendants
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
the way the way it is now is if somebody
 
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
is arrested by the police
 
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
um a bail commissioner is called
 
00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
and the veil commissioner determines
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
whether what kind of bail is is to be
 
00:15:13.009 --> 00:15:13.019 align:start position:0%
imposed up until the time the person can
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
be brought to court
 
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.210 align:start position:0%
be brought to court
uh

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:17.220 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
what what is important about this is
 
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
that the kind of the kind of crimes
 
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
that bail Commissioners are called to
 
00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.569 align:start position:0%
that bail Commissioners are called to
are

00:15:25.569 --> 00:15:25.579 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
pretty generally misdemeanors
 
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.430 align:start position:0%
pretty generally misdemeanors
and

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.230 align:start position:0%
and
the

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
and the bail commissioner is supposed to
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
get a fee but the fee is to be paid by
 
00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:41.420 align:start position:0%
the defendant
 
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
there are a few little issues with that
 
00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.629 align:start position:0%
there are a few little issues with that
too

00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
what this what the bill proposed or was
 
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
the court in the first instance would be
 
00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
the one that would set the uh the bail
 
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
but they would they would have
 
00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.210 align:start position:0%
but they would they would have
um

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
they would have magistrates to determine
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
what the bail should be in advance
 
00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:11.899 align:start position:0%
that didn't make a lot of sense because
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
you would have to have a whole bunch of
 
00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:18.500 align:start position:0%
magistrates in order to in order to
 
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
collect all the stuff that's being done
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
by bail Commissioners because there are
 
00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:24.779 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
40 50 bail Commissioners in the state
 
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
and each each district court has a bunch
 
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:33.959 align:start position:0%
of them in Superior Court it's a lot
 
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
different uh the in Superior Court
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
people that are accused with a crime are
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
arrested usually by the sheriff or by
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
where a police department and there
 
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
immediately brought two
 
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
the county jail
 
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
and there
 
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
Provisions are made for an amount of
 
00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:57.380 align:start position:0%
bail to be set by a court
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
that would be very difficult in these
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
cases because
 
00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:03.710 align:start position:0%
cases because
um

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
most of the crimes made rest made by the
 
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
police are
 
00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:12.839 align:start position:0%
either motor vehicle motor vehicle
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
charges or simple assault and you know
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
larceny and stuff like that which don't
 
00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:21.299 align:start position:0%
involve felonies
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
you know the such the situation that
 
00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:27.299 align:start position:0%
would occur if you passed what
 
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
I thought the bill was about
 
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
uh is that the uh the person will be
 
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:36.380 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
arrested and and brought somewhere we're
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
not sure where
 
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
and the court would eventually fix
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
amount of an amount of bail and the
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
people would be detained until that
 
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
happened and that could take some time
 
00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of days rather than minutes
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
um the other the other part of this
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
that's uh kind of contested uh
 
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
particularly on the part of bail
 
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
Commissioners is that bail Commissioners
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
are entitled to fee
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
and the amount of the fee is set by a
 
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.730 align:start position:0%
and the amount of the fee is set by a
law

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
but they have to collect the fee from
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
the defendant
 
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.950 align:start position:0%
the defendant
right

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
and of course if the defendant is at the
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
county jail
 
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.350 align:start position:0%
county jail
and

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
the fee is I forget it was eighteen
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
dollars the last time I heard
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
um it isn't isn't it great
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
but the if the bail is set and the
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
defendant doesn't have any money
 
00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh well they don't have the right to
 
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
hold them until the court can convene uh
 
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
so they've in in many cases the bail
 
00:18:48.409 --> 00:18:48.419 align:start position:0%
commissioner doesn't get paid
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
house bill I have I have one I'm
 
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
supposed to write
 
00:18:54.169 --> 00:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
a blurb on
 
00:18:57.409 --> 00:18:57.419 align:start position:0%
um has has to do the same within the
 
00:18:59.450 --> 00:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
um except that uh the uh
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
magistrates are people who are paid
 
00:19:09.529 --> 00:19:09.539 align:start position:0%
by by Appropriations
 
00:19:09.539 --> 00:19:11.750 align:start position:0%
by by Appropriations
and

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know how they're gonna how
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to get paid or how it's
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
going to be determined what happens to
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
the defendant and the bill the bill
 
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
wasn't very very clear about that
 
00:19:24.049 --> 00:19:24.059 align:start position:0%
and that's why
 
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
um there's been this is uh
 
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether representative
 
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
liesman filed uh this amendment
 
00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:36.529 align:start position:0%
liesman filed uh this amendment
2023-0915h

00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:36.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
um but I know what where House Bill 646
 
00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:42.539 align:start position:0%
is because I we most most of us
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
everybody on division one at least has a
 
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
copy of it in their binder so
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know what's going on I I don't
 
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.770 align:start position:0%
I don't know what's going on I I don't
know

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.970 align:start position:0%
know
um

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
I wasn't aware that representative
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
leishman had filed an amendment house
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
bill 46.
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
and so I I'm confused and I I don't I'm
 
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
certainly not going to vote for the
 
00:20:06.409 --> 00:20:06.419 align:start position:0%
motion as it stands because it turns the
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system uh on its ear
 
00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman no I can't I have no I know
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
what a magistrate is in in the broad
 
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
sense it's a person who makes decisions
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
in um in legal matters that magistrates
 
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
aren't all sounds like a judge well yeah
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
it does sound like a judge except that I
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
don't think magistrates get paid like a
 
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.430 align:start position:0%
don't think magistrates get paid like a
judge

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know I
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'll bring it back to representative
 
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
leishman thank you for your help
 
00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman the reason my name
 
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
is on the amendment it was a grammatical
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
change the LBA found so that was a
 
00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
correction uh again just for clarity
 
00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
this is a study committee it had no
 
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
Financial impact and that's why we voted
 
00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion on House
 
00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
Bill 46 FN
 
00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative hole thank you Mr chair
 
00:21:21.049 --> 00:21:21.059 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing bipartisan resistance to an
 
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
autopath as an amended motion is there
 
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:27.419 align:start position:0%
an appetite to itl this or retain this
 
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
the vote before us is auto pass is
 
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
amended so that would have to be
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
defeated before we go for another motion
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
chairman so I just want to add that this
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
is a bill that went through its first
 
00:21:42.049 --> 00:21:42.059 align:start position:0%
policy committee was amended to be the
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
study committee and then it kind of
 
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
wiped away the fiscal impact but due to
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
the process of the house it still came
 
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
to house finance in division one uh for
 
00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
a second review even though it did not
 
00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal impact it passed the first
 
00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
policy committee I believe unanimously
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
it was on the consent calendar we
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
adopted on a Voice vote it's just a
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
little bit more of the history of the
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
bill here I'll be voting yes on ought to
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
pass as amended as there's no fiscal
 
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
impact there's really no purview for
 
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
finance here we're just moving this
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
along the process the house desires
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
resume Edwards uh thank you Mr chair I
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
intend to vote uh in favor of the
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
division recommendation I'm sure they
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
looked at this and they put together a
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
good amendments and I support their work
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
representative grassy uh yes Mr chairman
 
00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
uh from what I understand this is a this
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
comes from to us from last year or last
 
00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
session when we had the bill which was
 
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
affectionately known as a catch and
 
00:22:39.409 --> 00:22:39.419 align:start position:0%
release most of our communities
 
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
particularly if you live in the cities
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
you get this a lot of responses from
 
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
your police departments so that people
 
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:46.940 align:start position:0%
have brought in bail Commissioners
 
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
are incapable of handling it and they're
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
released right back out on the streets
 
00:22:54.649 --> 00:22:54.659 align:start position:0%
to commit another crime and so there was
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
a a lot of people who had problems with
 
00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
that situation particularly when
 
00:23:00.049 --> 00:23:00.059 align:start position:0%
Indigent people that we don't want to
 
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
lock them up but we also want to be able
 
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
to deal with the issue and that this was
 
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
a compromise that was brought forward to
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
instead of bail commission so let's have
 
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
magistrates maybe we can get this thing
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
through the process a little quicker you
 
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
have people who are more
 
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:13.740 align:start position:0%
um more knowledgeable of the situations
 
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
on on on when you can release somebody
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
without collecting a bail particularly
 
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
somebody who's Indigent or whether you
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
should hold those people
 
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
um what happened is is that the bill
 
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.409 align:start position:0%
um what happened is is that the bill
wasn't

00:23:24.409 --> 00:23:24.419 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
what everybody expected it to be
 
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
probably so they wanted to since I
 
00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:30.059 align:start position:0%
wasn't here the first couple months when
 
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
this was held in the policy committee uh
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to take a look at and
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
study this I think it's looking for a
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
solution to a problem which does exist
 
00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
people don't want to hold Indigent
 
00:23:42.649 --> 00:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
people in in prisons and yet we need to
 
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
do something we just can't keep doing
 
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
the so-called Catch and Release because
 
00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:48.419 align:start position:0%
our constituents are upset about things
 
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
like that so I don't look at this as
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
that there's much bipartisan opposition
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
I think we all agree that we need to
 
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
find a solution and this is what we want
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
to do is now study it to look for that
 
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
solution so I'll be voting yes on this
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt now I'm in doing a
 
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
little more reading here
 
00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:10.820 align:start position:0%
uh this is an amendment to house bill
 
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
576. it's that's just attached because
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
of convenience for passing them all out
 
00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:18.539 align:start position:0%
so they wouldn't have to pass out two
 
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
bills at a time they'd staple them
 
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
together 576 were coming to later oh
 
00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.850 align:start position:0%
together 576 were coming to later oh
okay

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
that's the last one on the uh on the on
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
the docket okay just a convenience for
 
00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
passing them out so
 
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
we'd have and and also it got printed on
 
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
the other side as well so
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's really the whole economy of uh
 
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
economy of paper
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
but the the amendment
 
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.430 align:start position:0%
but the the amendment
um

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
changes the bill whatever it was that
 
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
evaluates whether the bail commissioner
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
should be replaced or supplemented by a
 
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
court Magistrate
 
00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.810 align:start position:0%
court Magistrate
it's

00:24:59.810 --> 00:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
well I'm not I'm not going to vote for
 
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
it because I really don't know where
 
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
it's going and I don't vote for Stuff
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
where I don't know where it's going
 
00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:08.690 align:start position:0%
where I don't know where it's going

House Bill 74.
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman this is
 
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
relative to an employee's unused earned
 
00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
time and I like to recognize
 
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
representing Kimbrell's to speak to the
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
motion of itl
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this bill basically
 
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
what it would do is mandate employers to
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
pay the employees for unused vacation
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
time when they either retire get laid
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
off or leave the job
 
00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
makes sense just common sense however
 
00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
the the division one committee voted 5-3
 
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
to itl because what we found was this is
 
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
not a widespread issue it's it's common
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
good business policy for companies to
 
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
pay their employees for their vacation
 
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
time during testimony yes there were a
 
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
few very egregious cases that were
 
00:27:57.529 --> 00:27:57.539 align:start position:0%
brought forth but they were few and far
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
between and there is also a process by
 
00:28:03.169 --> 00:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
which the employees can go and challenge
 
00:28:05.649 --> 00:28:05.659 align:start position:0%
not being paid anyway
 
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
so we just felt that we didn't need
 
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
additional legislation on employers
 
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
that's a contract between the employee
 
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
and the employer and they know what
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
they're doing when they when they get
 
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
together and they take a job and again
 
00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:21.299 align:start position:0%
shame on any employer that doesn't pay
 
00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:22.850 align:start position:0%
shame on any employer that doesn't pay
uh

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:24.779 align:start position:0%
their their employees for their vacation
 
00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
time but again in this economy
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
they would do well to make sure that
 
00:28:33.529 --> 00:28:33.539 align:start position:0%
they uh they treat the employees well
 
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
and that they would not uh have this bad
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
policy of not paying them for vacation
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
time so with that I would like to make a
 
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
motion to itl
 
00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:45.059 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
representative grassy
 
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:53.700 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman thank you
 
00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
um I you know I I put a lot of what he
 
00:28:59.330 --> 00:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
said representative said was was right
 
00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
you know this something doesn't
 
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
necessarily happen a lot
 
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
um and it's also you know this bill only
 
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
deals with businesses that are over 15
 
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
employees so it doesn't affect some
 
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
really small employers and that it's bad
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
that employers don't pay their when
 
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
employers don't pay their employees and
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
it puts the onus
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
on the back of the employee to collect
 
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
any time that they need and sometimes
 
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
when you're laid off or let go abruptly
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
in your job for whatever reason it may
 
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
be many times no fault of your own
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
um you um you're you're then required to
 
00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
go and figure out where how are you
 
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
supposed to complain about this and a
 
00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
lot of times you're just too busy
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
looking for another job
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
I personally went through this
 
00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
when covet hit
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
they came into our office this was in
 
00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.190 align:start position:0%
they came into our office this was in
March

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
March
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
came into our office and said you know
 
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
we want everybody to show up at 10
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning so I showed up at
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock that morning and they showed
 
00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
because I had the night shift and
 
00:29:58.730 --> 00:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
um they said oh by the way we're
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
shutting down at midnight
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
and I said you know do we have um
 
00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
medical benefits they said you know your
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
medical benefits end at midnight and uh
 
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
and then they gave us they said we'll
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
have your checks for you you know
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
tomorrow uh here you know your checks
 
00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
will be available to you
 
00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:18.059 align:start position:0%
our vacation time I'd been there for 10
 
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
years our vacation time recruit on
 
00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
January 1st those people who took their
 
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
vacations between January 1st and March
 
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
got their vacation time in their sick
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
time those of us who did not take our
 
00:30:30.169 --> 00:30:30.179 align:start position:0%
vacation time me being one of them
 
00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
because I usually take it in August lost
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
my vacation time they did not pay it
 
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
only happens a few times and you'd say
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
that you know in particularly in today's
 
00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
employment people would want to make
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
sure they pay their employees well when
 
00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:43.740 align:start position:0%
you when you're letting somebody go you
 
00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:46.140 align:start position:0%
don't care if they like you or not when
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
you're shutting down you don't care if
 
00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
they like you or not if it's only a few
 
00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
cases this shouldn't be a problem it
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
should be zero cases
 
00:30:57.649 --> 00:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask to defeat the motion of
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
itl and so we can get this ought to pass
 
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
and get it out there because those
 
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
people who are let go you know they they
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
told me they said oh by the way you can
 
00:31:09.169 --> 00:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
go on COBRA but when you're unemployed
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
Cobra doesn't make sense either my
 
00:31:12.889 --> 00:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
vacation pay may have made a difference
 
00:31:15.169 --> 00:31:15.179 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
and I would encourage you to vote no on
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
this motion and so that we can get ought
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
to pass and get this to the floor so
 
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
that we can treat all employees
 
00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.470 align:start position:0%
that we can treat all employees
favorably

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
favorably
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative propovici Miller
 
00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to point
 
00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
out that while the intent of the bill is
 
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
to right or wrong every bill that we
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
pass has the potential for unintended
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
consequences and one of the very
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
predictable unintended consequences is a
 
00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:44.700 align:start position:0%
very popular practice in the biotech
 
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
sector where I now have two family
 
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
members employed in up from one
 
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
and that's called unlimited vacation
 
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
time and what they mean by unlimited
 
00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
vacation time is that you get as much
 
00:32:00.289 --> 00:32:00.299 align:start position:0%
vacation as you can get approved by your
 
00:32:00.299 --> 00:32:01.850 align:start position:0%
vacation as you can get approved by your
supervisor

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
supervisor
 
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
but you also don't have any accrual of
 
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
vacation time because it's not a limited
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
amount of vacation time and therefore
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
there is nothing to accrue for because
 
00:32:12.049 --> 00:32:12.059 align:start position:0%
you have unlimited vacation
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
guess what happens when you get let go
 
00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
there is no vacation time to be paid off
 
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:19.940 align:start position:0%
I would rather not give employees
 
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
incentives to stop offering regular
 
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
vacation time that's accrued and it gets
 
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
paid to most people when they leave
 
00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
and frankly when an employee goes
 
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:31.740 align:start position:0%
bankrupt they can have any obligations
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
they want there is no blood you can get
 
00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:36.299 align:start position:0%
out of a stone when they are insoluble
 
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
they are insoluble I will vote to itl
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
this because of concerns over the
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences thank you
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
00:32:51.409 --> 00:32:51.419 align:start position:0%
I I recognize all the comments that have
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
been made
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
but if you read the bill you'll find
 
00:32:57.169 --> 00:32:57.179 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of bookkeeping requirements placed
 
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
on companies
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
and I think with the with the few
 
00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.149 align:start position:0%
and I think with the with the few
instances

00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
instances
 
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
unfortunately representative Gracie's
 
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
was a victim of it but there aren't that
 
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.510 align:start position:0%
was a victim of it but there aren't that
many

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.029 align:start position:0%
many
uh

00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
incidences Statewide we found very few
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
and I think the owner's provisions of
 
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
all the bookkeeping Provisions for this
 
00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.389 align:start position:0%
all the bookkeeping Provisions for this
outweigh

00:33:25.389 --> 00:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
outweigh
 
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
those those isolated
 
00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:33.289 align:start position:0%
those those isolated
instances

00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.299 --> 00:33:37.009 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:37.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.409 --> 00:33:39.419 align:start position:0%
um just to comment on the financial
 
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
aspects of this there is a fiscal note
 
00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:45.740 align:start position:0%
on here that says 4.5 million but that
 
00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:48.779 align:start position:0%
would affect the budget if every single
 
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
state employee quit at the same time and
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
so we understood from the uh from the
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor that during testimony and
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
the hearing commissioner Arling house
 
00:34:06.409 --> 00:34:06.419 align:start position:0%
actually said that the financial hit of
 
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
this would be absolutely de minimis and
 
00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
we did hear that there are very few
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
related claims
 
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
so if you're looking at it from a
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
budgetary standpoint there was a de
 
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
any further questions or discussions
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none the clerk will call the role
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
the motion is itl on House Bill 74.

investigations and testing and
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring relative to pfafs this came
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
to us with an
 
00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
appropriation request of two million
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%

Fund to pfas response fund
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
the division is looking to retain it and
 
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.089 --> 00:37:44.099 align:start position:0%
okay and retain does not require a
 
00:37:44.099 --> 00:37:45.109 align:start position:0%
okay and retain does not require a
report

00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion to
 
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.950 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion to
retain

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:53.569 --> 00:37:53.579 align:start position:0%
so it's it's representative leishman
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
do we have a second second
 
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:16.730 align:start position:0%
do we have a second second
representative

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire so we do expect
 
00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
to put something of this in the house
 
00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099 align:start position:0%
bill too but I don't believe it's
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily the entire funding that the
 
00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
bill itself has
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that's usually understood on when
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
we retain a bill we'll put in what we
 
00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.109 align:start position:0%
we retain a bill we'll put in what we
can

00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
when we come to that portion of the
 
00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.589 align:start position:0%
when we come to that portion of the
budget

00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:38:41.329 --> 00:38:41.339 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion to
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
retain representative Abel yeah
 
00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clarify there actually
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
will be no
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
appropriated with this what's happening
 
00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.339 align:start position:0%
is that we decided to
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
make the language changes that were in
 
00:38:58.690 --> 00:38:58.700 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
but to allow Des to use a certain
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
portion of the money which it otherwise
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been able to by
 
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
um by expanding the language and the and
 
00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
it says that they can use 10 of the
 
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
appropriation for investigation and the
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
other things provided in the bill so
 
00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:25.619 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman this is relative
 
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
to renewable energy credits one of the
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
few bills that you'll see from us
 
00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
without recommendation I'd call a
 
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
okay well I move
 
00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on HB 234
 
00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:47.750 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on HB 234
second

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very Motion in a second to
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on House Bill 234 for the
 
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
yes at the financial effect and there is
 
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
absolutely no discernible Financial
 
00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:08.579 align:start position:0%
effect to the
 
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
budget it really is more of um
 
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
I would say a policy issue regarding the
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
use of renewable energy credits and
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
whether they can be swept by utility
 
00:44:26.569 --> 00:44:26.579 align:start position:0%
companies instead of
 
00:44:26.579 --> 00:44:27.710 align:start position:0%
companies instead of
um

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
I have to say this right I'm not an Ste
 
00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
person uh that wreck sweeping has
 
00:44:35.329 --> 00:44:35.339 align:start position:0%
decimated the New Hampshire Rec market
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
and significantly decreased alternative
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
compliance payments the only source of
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
funding for the renewable fund which is
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
our state's Soul mechanism for investing
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
in the clean energy transition ending
 
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
Rec sweeping might arguably increase
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
electricity bills buy Pennies on the
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
average monthly bill but renewable
 
00:44:59.089 --> 00:44:59.099 align:start position:0%
energy Investments pay off in lower
 
00:45:02.089 --> 00:45:02.099 align:start position:0%
demand for fossil fuel lower Peak demand
 
00:45:04.609 --> 00:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
improved air quality more jobs and
 
00:45:08.569 --> 00:45:08.579 align:start position:0%
increased in-state economic activity so
 
00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:11.339 align:start position:0%
I would urge the committee to pass this
 
00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
bill in favor of the House vote and in
 
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
light of the fact that it has no effect
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:21.900 align:start position:0%

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.150 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
McGuire

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
McGuire
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yes I I agree that
 
00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
this is not really a finance bill and so
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh probably we should just simply vote
 
00:45:35.809 --> 00:45:35.819 align:start position:0%
on it as we did in the house floor but
 
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to this particular policy
 
00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
um because it it basically would
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
redirect roughly three million dollars a
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
year from rate payers into this
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
particular fund
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
um and that that's the main uh purpose
 
00:45:56.569 --> 00:45:56.579 align:start position:0%
of the bill but but our electric rates
 
00:45:59.809 --> 00:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
are extremely high at the moment and
 
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
um rate payers need all the help they
 
00:46:05.809 --> 00:46:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
Campbell's thank you Mr chair yes I also
 
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
agree with representative evil that this
 
00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
is probably uh this is a policy issue
 
00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
having been on Science and Technology
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
I'm very familiar with the issue and I
 
00:46:23.329 --> 00:46:23.339 align:start position:0%
can tell you that from a financial
 
00:46:25.609 --> 00:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
standpoint it does affect the rate
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
payers in a negative way so
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
um I would vote to not not pass this
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
bill I would vote to itl it
 
00:46:39.069 --> 00:46:39.079 align:start position:0%
representative papavichi Milner
 
00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
One Financial aspect of this is that it
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
will make electricity more expensive for
 
00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
everybody including the government so it
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
does have an impact on us even though
 
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
it's not a huge impact
 
00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
and we do have an obligation to try to
 
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
run the government that uh you know as
 
00:46:58.970 --> 00:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
low cost as possible so I'm planning to
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
further discussion from committee

members representative Abel thank you
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
well I know for people who've worked
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
very hard on this I would be remiss if I
 
00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
didn't say that by investing in
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
renewable energy you do ultimately lower
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
electricity costs for all so that is a
 
00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
reason to pass it
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Hull
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair having installed and
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
designed and installed solar systems for
 
00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:32.660 align:start position:0%
myself and others
 
00:47:35.329 --> 00:47:35.339 align:start position:0%
the issue is not the amount of solar
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
power we have a peak energy usage
 
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
between 4 pm and about 8 PM every day
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
and even if we build more solar we still
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
have to supplement all of that with
 
00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:47.690 align:start position:0%
have to supplement all of that with
additional

00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
um more trustworthy sources of energy
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
whether that's natural gas oil coal
 
00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.710 align:start position:0%
whether that's natural gas oil coal
hydroelectric

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric
 
00:47:59.450 --> 00:47:59.460 align:start position:0%
Nuclear So as much as I like the idea
 
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
it doesn't solve the real issue until we
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
start addressing Peak shaving
 
00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:07.619 align:start position:0%

motion to retain with the understanding
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
that this will be added to House Bill 2.
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
I'm the prime sponsor of House Bill 272
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
as well as a supporter I'll be voting in
 
00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
favor to retain just a little background
 
00:54:15.049 --> 00:54:15.059 align:start position:0%
this bill came out of the house
 
00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
education committee 19-1 came out of the
 
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
Full House
 
00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
348 to 11. and came out of division two
 
00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
with a unanimous recommendation to
 
00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
retain and place in house bill 2.
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
right now charter school students per
 
00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:36.260 align:start position:0%
pupil receive at their schools
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
approximately seventy three hundred
 
00:54:40.849 --> 00:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
dollars per pupil
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
that amount was set in 2017.
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
this bill along with the governor's
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
proposal inadequacy Aid would then bring
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
the number up to nine thousand dollars
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
per pupil for Charter School students
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
certainly an increase that is deserved
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
and certainly one well worth the wait
 
00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
since it hasn't happened since
 
00:55:08.089 --> 00:55:08.099 align:start position:0%
2017. so with that again I'll be voting
 
00:55:10.609 --> 00:55:10.619 align:start position:0%
to retain with the understanding that it
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
will go in House Bill 2. thank you

prohibiting the disposal of certain food
 
00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:22.740 align:start position:0%

position called a waste management
 
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
specialist three and I know
 
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:30.180 align:start position:0%

comes to
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
20-0 recommendation of ought to pass
 
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:46.140 align:start position:0%
from environment of Agriculture it
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
passed in the house on a voice Voice
 
00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:50.710 align:start position:0%
passed in the house on a voice Voice
vote

00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
it also comes to us with a unanimous
 
00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
recommendation to retain for HB 2 from
 
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
our division it's really
 
01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:02.510 align:start position:0%
our division it's really
um

01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh the culmination of a lot of work
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
starting with the creation of a new
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Management plan
 
01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
it was recommended and and part of the
 
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
solid waste management plan is that we
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
really have to start to put Less in our
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
landfills to preserve the landfill space
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
for ourself and for things that other
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
you can't do other with 25 of all that
 
01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:29.660 align:start position:0%
goes into
 
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
landfills in terms of weight is food
 
01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:35.660 align:start position:0%
waste so this um
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
would prohibit the disposal of food
 
01:00:44.329 --> 01:00:44.339 align:start position:0%
scraps by generators of one ton or more
 
01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
of food scraps a week and the diversion
 
01:00:51.289 --> 01:00:51.299 align:start position:0%
requirement would only apply if there
 
01:00:53.809 --> 01:00:53.819 align:start position:0%
was a place for these food scraps to go
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
within 20 miles and it also
 
01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
asks that the way you divert the food
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
scraps is first by feeding humans second
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
by animals and thirdly by composting or
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
anaerobic digestion this Bill had
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely no opposition in the division
 
01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
or in committee it was supported by
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
Waste Management which is a landfill
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
operator it was also supported by
 
01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.130 align:start position:0%
operator it was also supported by
um

01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:28.140 align:start position:0%
by the food banks folks because they're
 
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
really excited at the prospect of more
 
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
food to be donated and I would
 
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
appreciate a vote to retain it for the
 
01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:43.490 align:start position:0%
appreciate a vote to retain it for the
budget

01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%

speak to the
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
in a second from representative McGuire
 
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
I was involved with the reserves for
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
many years and and also the National
 
01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
Guard a bit and
 
01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
there it's a very competitive thing
 
01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
especially in a small state like ours
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
they could shop around to see what will
 
01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
they get from Massachusetts or Maine or
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
some other state we need to keep the
 
01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
troops up in case of emergencies in the
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
state obviously some of them have now
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
been called to be prison guards because
 
01:03:56.089 --> 01:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
of the shortage there and the National
 
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
Guard people usually called up an
 
01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
emergencies for covering up for for
 
01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
plowing and whatever else needs to be
 
01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
done in floods and so on so it's
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
important so this bill takes money it's
 
01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
not General funds it comes from fines
 
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
in a military court and puts him in a
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
fund presently the in
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
the enlistment incentive is 500 this
 
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
doubles it to a thousand and they think
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to cost about fifty
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
thousand a year but it's covered by the
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
fines and fees so it's not a problem for
 
01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
us with the general fund so I think it's
 
01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:39.059 align:start position:0%
needed I think it's necessary and I
 
01:04:40.849 --> 01:04:40.859 align:start position:0%
think we got a good vote on it I move on
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
to pass and McGuire seconds it thank you
 
01:04:47.930 --> 01:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none the clerk will call a roll
 
01:04:53.809 --> 01:04:53.819 align:start position:0%

01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
certification will provide notice of
 
01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
public meetings and allow for public
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
comment the vote was nine to zero vought
 
01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
to pass representative McGuire moves yes
 
01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
I move out to pass
 
01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
is there a second second by

um may I speak Mr chairman speak yes so
 
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note for this says up to a
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars a year but we
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
think this will be next to zero
 
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
um and it also shows that it could be
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
General funds but the but the office of
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
professional licensure is
 
01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
um moving off budget sort of they're
 
01:06:58.250 --> 01:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
they're going to be funded strictly from
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
their fees uh through a dedicated fund
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
and so this will not be General funds
 
01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:07.619 align:start position:0%

is this consent yeah okay very good no
 
01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
minority for it
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
what was the question three three seven
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
I think that had a little money in it
 
01:14:30.649 --> 01:14:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
well supposedly if it has money in it we
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't put it on consent so we'll be
 
01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
on a regular calendar okay
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to House Bill 462
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative representative leishman
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
is recognized
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this is making an
 
01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation to the solid waste
 
01:14:49.130 --> 01:14:49.140 align:start position:0%
management fund
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
and targeting food waste reduction and
 
01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.590 align:start position:0%
and targeting food waste reduction and
diversion

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
diversion
 
01:14:58.010 --> 01:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
I will ask representative Ebel to move
 
01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
this and I know she wishes to speak to
 
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
this as well
 
01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.910 align:start position:0%
this as well
we're

01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:07.100 align:start position:0%
paying this bill has been put it into
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
hb2 this is another bill that comes from
 
01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:11.709 align:start position:0%
hb2 this is another bill that comes from
the

01:15:11.709 --> 01:15:11.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
Ena committee with a 20-zip vote in
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
favor of passing and voted on it um it
 
01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
passed on a Voice vote it was uh the
 
01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
motion to retain was seven to zero
 
01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
within the division this had absolutely
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
no opposition it was supported by quite
 
01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
a few folks in particular the New
 
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association among
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
others this
 
01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:39.410 align:start position:0%
others this
um

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
expands the uh
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
sources from which the fund can be
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
financed to include more than EPA grants
 
01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
which it had been limited to before I
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
think through oversight and it also adds
 
01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:00.260 align:start position:0%
language to Target the use of the fund
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
for food waste diversion until
 
01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
2027 50 percent of it could be targeted
 
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
for food waste diversion I already
 
01:16:13.010 --> 01:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
explained why why food waste diversion
 
01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:15.900 align:start position:0%
is really important in the context of
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
our landfills this also will help us
 
01:16:21.229 --> 01:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
begin to make more projects I mean
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
progress in keeping things out of our
 
01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
landfills and you know I would just say
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
there's increasing concern about pfas
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
and not that this is a direct line to
 
01:16:36.169 --> 01:16:36.179 align:start position:0%
pfas reduction but let's face it the
 
01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
less waste we put in our landfills where
 
01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
so much waste has pfas pfas goes in the
 
01:16:43.729 --> 01:16:43.739 align:start position:0%
landfill leachate which goes to our
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants so I think
 
01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
this is a win-win across the board and
 
01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
it has a substantial true bipartisan
 
01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
support as far as co-sponsorship so I'd
 
01:16:59.810 --> 01:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
appreciate your support thank you
 
01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%

01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:10.140 align:start position:0%

01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
and it's moved by representative Hewitt
 
01:18:42.649 --> 01:18:42.659 align:start position:0%
I'd ask representative Hewitt to speak
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%

01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:47.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:18:47.699 --> 01:18:48.410 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
just Advantage because I didn't bring my
 
01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
notes with me this afternoon uh the
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
adult parole parole board deals with
 
01:18:58.669 --> 01:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
everybody who gets some imprisoned at
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state prison and when
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
it comes down time for that parole
 
01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
either based on the amount of time
 
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
they've spent or some other uh reason
 
01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
like a court order
 
01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:12.530 align:start position:0%
like a court order
um

01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
they have to appear before the Adult
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
Parole Board
 
01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
and as my memory serves me the parole
 
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
board sits with five members
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
what they do is they hear whatever
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
information that the uh
 
01:19:34.510 --> 01:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
prison system and the uh
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
and the and the people who deal with the
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
prisoners after they've released until
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
their whole their whole sentence has
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
been expired
 
01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:45.770 align:start position:0%
been expired
um

01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
the the Mona it's mostly a money Bill to
 
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
increase the uh staff of the board
 
01:19:54.169 --> 01:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
because there's only they only have they
 
01:19:57.490 --> 01:19:57.500 align:start position:0%
only have two two
 
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
actives inside the uh built inside the
 
01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
the board this they do the paperwork
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
that it set gets separated amongst all
 
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
the uh all the participants and then uh
 
01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
every month they have a total of two at
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
two sessions of the parole board
 
01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
it's it's a little bit odd because you
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
don't think of the parole board as being
 
01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
much of anything as far as
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
as far as spending money is concerned
 
01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
but it's surprising when you find out
 
01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
the the number of people who are
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
sentenced to the state prison is rather
 
01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.610 align:start position:0%
sentenced to the state prison is rather
substantial

01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
and they have
 
01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.090 align:start position:0%
and they have
um

01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
they were there were over 100 people
 
01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
that uh that come before the parole
 
01:20:56.510 --> 01:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
board during the course of a a season
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
they make twice a month
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
and the whole the whole uh thrust of the
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
bill is to
 
01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.110 align:start position:0%
bill is to
uh

01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:12.729 --> 01:21:12.739 align:start position:0%
to spend money in terms for example it
 
01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
spends uh ten thousand dollars
 
01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:17.630 align:start position:0%
spends uh ten thousand dollars
um

01:21:17.630 --> 01:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.830 align:start position:0%
um
per

01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
per
 
01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
year that's an annual stipend and they
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
want to increase it uh
 
01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
from 20 actually they pay twenty
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
thousand they want to increase it by ten
 
01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
thousand to thirty thousand uh and it
 
01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
also allows former parole board members
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
to sit in hearings I want a full panel
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
of three cannot be attained
 
01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
that's interesting because not many
 
01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
people want to serve on the parole board
 
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
uh and with all of the uh all of the
 
01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
cases they have that which involve a lot
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
of information that has to be gathered
 
01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
by the small staff
 
01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:56.510 align:start position:0%
by the small staff
um

01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
not many people want to serve what if
 
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
they're not a member and and mostly the
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
only people who can serve other than the
 
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.610 align:start position:0%
only people who can serve other than the
actual

01:22:07.610 --> 01:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
actual
 
01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
um actual board members our former board
 
01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:11.450 align:start position:0%
um actual board members our former board
members

01:22:11.450 --> 01:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
and uh they most of them don't have a
 
01:22:20.709 --> 01:22:20.719 align:start position:0%
really glowing history or glowing
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
sense of what went on in the proceedings
 
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
and also it's a pretty uh it's a pretty
 
01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
nasty stuff
 
01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:32.270 align:start position:0%
nasty stuff
so

01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:32.930 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:35.570 --> 01:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that was being asked
 
01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
for is uh thirty thousand dollars to
 
01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
increase the size of the board
 
01:22:43.370 --> 01:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
and increase the the
 
01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:44.450 align:start position:0%
and increase the the
uh

01:22:44.450 --> 01:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:46.850 align:start position:0%
uh
the

01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:49.610 --> 01:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
the increase of increasing steps they've
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
been for the vice chair of 20 to 20
 
01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
former members are paid 300 a pop for
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
for the times that they sit the portal
 
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
board sits twice a month
 
01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
and the uh and the
 
01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.709 align:start position:0%
and the uh and the
hearings

01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
involved quite quite a bit of time and
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
they're kind of contentious at times I
 
01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:18.830 align:start position:0%
they're kind of contentious at times I
imagine

01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
so this is this is a simple build to
 
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.510 align:start position:0%
so this is this is a simple build to
just

01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
beef up the adult parole board so that
 
01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
they don't have a lot of delays because
 
01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
if you if you don't have people to serve
 
01:23:33.169 --> 01:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
on the board uh or you don't have enough
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
people to serve on the board parole
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
hearings get delayed and that isn't a
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
very good feeling for particularly for
 
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
the participants and it makes the parole
 
01:23:47.450 --> 01:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
board members concerned about the
 
01:23:49.630 --> 01:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
adequacy of the job that they're doing
 
01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
so uh the committee voted uh seven to
 
01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:56.090 align:start position:0%
so uh the committee voted uh seven to
two

01:23:56.090 --> 01:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:23:59.689 --> 01:23:59.699 align:start position:0%
uh to a subgritty voted seven to two to
 
01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:08.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Hewitt moves
 
01:24:12.530 --> 01:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative walner seconds
 
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
further comments from the committee
 
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
so the bill really actually does two
 
01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:22.970 align:start position:0%
so the bill really actually does two
things

01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
and I think judge Hewitt um
 
01:24:27.550 --> 01:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt
 
01:24:30.649 --> 01:24:30.659 align:start position:0%
outlined them but the first the first
 
01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
part of the bill allows the chair of the
 
01:24:35.630 --> 01:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
parole board
 
01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:37.070 align:start position:0%
parole board
to

01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:38.870 align:start position:0%
to
use

01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
pre people who had previously served on
 
01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
the parole board to sit in when he could
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
not find three members three of the
 
01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
regular members to sit on a hearing this
 
01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
has been a problem and he need it really
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
backs them up when they have to delay
 
01:24:59.870 --> 01:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
the hearings because they can't get
 
01:25:03.649 --> 01:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
three members so this just allows him to
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
use previous members to be basically
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
substitutes and he asked for for five
 
01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
days a year that he could use someone as
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
a substitute and that it would be they
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
would be paid at three hundred dollars a
 
01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.130 align:start position:0%
would be paid at three hundred dollars a
day

01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
the second part of the bill actually
 
01:25:24.110 --> 01:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
talks about the stipend of the members
 
01:25:26.570 --> 01:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
the um chair of the parole board is
 
01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
actually a state employee
 
01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
and there's no no increase in the
 
01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
stipend for for the um chair there are
 
01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
um three members
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
who are regular members they're now paid
 
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
ten dollar uh ten thousand dollars a
 
01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
year uh this would raise them another
 
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
ten to twenty thousand and the
 
01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
um Vice chair
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
is now
 
01:25:57.770 --> 01:25:57.780 align:start position:0%
um paid twenty thousand I'm sorry the
 
01:25:59.149 --> 01:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
vice chair
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
um gets would raise to thirty thousand
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
now I know that sounds like
 
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
big raises but these are well qualified
 
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
people and difficult to find
 
01:26:14.450 --> 01:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
often they're
 
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
um lawyers
 
01:26:19.810 --> 01:26:19.820 align:start position:0%
they're often people who have actually
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
worked in the prison system and have
 
01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.649 align:start position:0%
worked in the prison system and have
retired

01:26:24.649 --> 01:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
retired
 
01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
they're very difficult to find and this
 
01:26:29.890 --> 01:26:29.900 align:start position:0%
work is not easy
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
it takes many many many hours to prepare
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
for a parole hearing they also do
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
revocations so if someone was losing
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
their parole they'll also do those so
 
01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
this is really difficult work and our
 
01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
stipends have been low and this will
 
01:26:54.169 --> 01:26:54.179 align:start position:0%
hopefully increase the pool of people
 
01:26:56.330 --> 01:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
who would be willing to serve on the
 
01:26:59.870 --> 01:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
parole board and I think as Citizens if
 
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
we stop and think about this this is a
 
01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
really important duty they have for
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
safety in our communities putting people
 
01:27:13.129 --> 01:27:13.139 align:start position:0%
out on parole a serious business so
 
01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
um I hope that you'll support the bill
 
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and thank you Mr
 
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
chairman I I do support the bill
 
01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
um I just want to correct the the
 
01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:25.070 align:start position:0%
um I just want to correct the the
numbers

01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:26.950 align:start position:0%
numbers
um

01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
no problem it's just the parole board
 
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
has five members the chair is a
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
full-time state employee the other four
 
01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
are currently paid twenty thousand
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
dollars each this bill would raise the
 
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
vice chair to forty thousand and the
 
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
other three members to thirty thousand
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
but there but the
 
01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
representative walner is exactly correct
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
that these are very experienced people
 
01:27:58.610 --> 01:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
retired judges attorneys I think in one
 
01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
case we have like a former Commissioner
 
01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:03.780 align:start position:0%
of of Corrections from another state you
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
know this kind of thing so so
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
um this is really not uh they're working
 
01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
I think close to full-time or quite
 
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time and not
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:25.729 --> 01:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
representative Campbell's thank you Mr
 
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
chair for the record I was one of the
 
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
ones in division that voted against this
 
01:28:32.450 --> 01:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
um and thank you representative Walnut
 
01:28:34.729 --> 01:28:34.739 align:start position:0%
for making it clear to the committee
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
exactly what the bill did have no issue
 
01:28:39.169 --> 01:28:39.179 align:start position:0%
with the first part for the temporary
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
people getting the money however I
 
01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
didn't see the justification I don't
 
01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
agree with representative McGuire
 
01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
looking at the hours that these people
 
01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:50.940 align:start position:0%
put in I did not see a justification for
 
01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
giving a 50 raise and a 100 raise for
 
01:28:57.169 --> 01:28:57.179 align:start position:0%
the chair given their track record it's
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
not only that they haven't put in as
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
much time as you would think they would
 
01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
be but the track record of the parole
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
board is not exactly Stellar uh and I
 
01:29:09.649 --> 01:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
don't know anybody else in the state or
 
01:29:12.129 --> 01:29:12.139 align:start position:0%
in any occupation that gets 50 or 100
 
01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
raises so on principle I voted against
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
it again I'm not against the I know the
 
01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
parole board does uh you know it's a
 
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
very important job and it's and it's a
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
job that has a lot of stress I'm sure
 
01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
but uh but I I just couldn't justify
 
01:29:29.890 --> 01:29:29.900 align:start position:0%
though that kind of a percentage raise
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
for these positions and they are as you
 
01:29:36.410 --> 01:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
said retired lawyers and judges you know
 
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
boohoo I'm not making a lot of money I'm
 
01:29:41.570 --> 01:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
sure they're already rich so
 
01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair I I estimate I
 
01:29:50.050 --> 01:29:50.060 align:start position:0%
make about three cents an hour and
 
01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
I I'm just curious uh has anyone done
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
the math to sort of figure out how many
 
01:29:58.850 --> 01:29:58.860 align:start position:0%
hours what the hourly rate turns out to
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
be for say the vice chair who will be
 
01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
raised to forty thousand
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you Massey yeah all right Susan
 
01:30:11.209 --> 01:30:11.219 align:start position:0%
McGuire not specifically but first of
 
01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:13.380 align:start position:0%
all if I remember correctly they do meet
 
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
weekly and on Tuesday they do
 
01:30:22.370 --> 01:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
um parole hearings for seven roughly 17
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
um inmates and then on Thursdays they do
 
01:30:28.970 --> 01:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
revocation hearings which are for uh
 
01:30:31.129 --> 01:30:31.139 align:start position:0%
people who violate their parole whether
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
they should be remanded back into prison
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
so typically that would be about half
 
01:30:39.410 --> 01:30:39.420 align:start position:0%
that number so say eight so so they get
 
01:30:41.689 --> 01:30:41.699 align:start position:0%
very thick packets of paper that they
 
01:30:44.090 --> 01:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
have to prepare for those you know so
 
01:30:46.189 --> 01:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
the the here the Tuesdays and Thursdays
 
01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
are sort of all day but there's there's
 
01:30:51.649 --> 01:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know 40 pages or
 
01:30:53.930 --> 01:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
something worth a paper on each each
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
individual so there's a lot of prep work
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
as well so it's a lot of work
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
chair so so I I think I'm going to vote
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
against this so that if it passes
 
01:31:08.209 --> 01:31:08.219 align:start position:0%
they're going to be very grateful to all
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
of you and I'm going to hope that they
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
representative hole and then I think
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt still has a light
 
01:31:18.530 --> 01:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
on I'll come to you second
 
01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:21.719 align:start position:0%
representative hole thank you Mr chair
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
um additional clarification from
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire on how often they
 
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
meet is helpful but I I have to admit I
 
01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.810 align:start position:0%
meet is helpful but I I have to admit I
have

01:31:29.810 --> 01:31:29.820 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
um some concerns
 
01:31:35.209 --> 01:31:35.219 align:start position:0%
in line 16 through 20 relative to the
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
base pay going from twenty to thirty
 
01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and the vice chairman
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
from 20 to 40. if I recall our executive
 
01:31:47.410 --> 01:31:47.420 align:start position:0%
Council lawyers who meet twice a month
 
01:31:49.850 --> 01:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
and have something on the order of ten
 
01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:51.719 align:start position:0%
thousand pages to read between those
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
hearings on contracts get seventeen
 
01:31:56.450 --> 01:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or so
 
01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:57.229 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or so
um

01:31:57.229 --> 01:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:59.450 --> 01:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
and granted those are elected positions
 
01:32:03.290 --> 01:32:03.300 align:start position:0%
not not employee positions
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
um is there any way to divide this
 
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
because I'm really in favor of section
 
01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:29.290 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:32:29.290 --> 01:32:29.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.610 --> 01:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
normally we deal with the whole bill in
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
its entirety the speaker may decide to
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
divide it when it comes to the floor
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
but normally in a committee we don't
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
make such decisions
 
01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:32:47.209 --> 01:32:47.219 align:start position:0%
representative heward relative to the
 
01:32:49.370 --> 01:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
amount of money being paid these these
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
are not laborers these are all these are
 
01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
all people mostly they're mostly
 
01:32:55.450 --> 01:32:55.460 align:start position:0%
professional people
 
01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:57.229 align:start position:0%
professional people
and

01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:57.239 --> 01:32:58.850 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:32:58.850 --> 01:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:00.410 align:start position:0%
um
they

01:33:00.410 --> 01:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:33:02.570 --> 01:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
they work a lot of they work a lot of
 
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
hours but we have to bear in mind that
 
01:33:06.410 --> 01:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
we are dealing with people who are
 
01:33:08.810 --> 01:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
performing a very difficult task
 
01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:12.900 align:start position:0%
uh and on the issue of uh them not doing
 
01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
a very good job because not everybody is
 
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
is successful you're talking with people
 
01:33:18.890 --> 01:33:18.900 align:start position:0%
who have spent time in the state prison
 
01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
and they didn't spend time in the state
 
01:33:22.490 --> 01:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
prison for not going through for going
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:27.239 --> 01:33:27.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:33:27.970 --> 01:33:27.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:31.669 --> 01:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
recidivism is is a subject that is dealt
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
with all the time and it's argued about
 
01:33:37.370 --> 01:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
um but these these people who serve on
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
the board are professionals and uh they
 
01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
understand what the the success rate is
 
01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:45.890 align:start position:0%
understand what the the success rate is
not

01:33:45.890 --> 01:33:45.900 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
um 100 percent
 
01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.129 align:start position:0%
um 100 percent
and

01:33:49.129 --> 01:33:49.139 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
you're gonna you they have they have a
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
hard time hiring uh
 
01:33:56.810 --> 01:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
parole board members when there's a
 
01:34:00.410 --> 01:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
vacancy uh so
 
01:34:03.290 --> 01:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
I don't see any reason why you know the
 
01:34:06.050 --> 01:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
the this the increase at this time which
 
01:34:09.169 --> 01:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened in quite a few years uh
 
01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:11.060 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be made
 
01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
they earn every penny of every of every
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative cam cameras and then
 
01:34:23.629 --> 01:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
represent a pump of each evening thank
 
01:34:25.490 --> 01:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I'll just reiterate I keep
 
01:34:27.410 --> 01:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
hearing they work a lot of hours they
 
01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
work a lot of hours but I'm an engineer
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
and when when I heard the testimony they
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
meet on Tuesday they meet on Thursday I
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't I didn't see a full-time job
 
01:34:40.129 --> 01:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
there anywhere and I didn't see a lot of
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh that it was a part-time thing as far
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
as I was concerned so if if you're going
 
01:34:46.490 --> 01:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
to keep throwing out that they work a
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
lot of hours I'd like somebody to
 
01:34:50.590 --> 01:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Mueller thank you Mr
 
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
chair no I'm not an expert in the legal
 
01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:57.830 align:start position:0%
chair no I'm not an expert in the legal
system

01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
but I used to be a network administrator
 
01:35:03.169 --> 01:35:03.179 align:start position:0%
and this has something to do in common
 
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
with uh you know being on the parole
 
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
board which is that nobody ever tells
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you when you get it right but
 
01:35:11.090 --> 01:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
boy when you may get it wrong you will
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
hear from people and
 
01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying they are perfect I'm not
 
01:35:18.169 --> 01:35:18.179 align:start position:0%
saying they don't have but you know but
 
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
it's a darn hard job and you only hear
 
01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
about it when you do it when something
 
01:35:27.050 --> 01:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
goes wrong so it's just a tough job and
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
I I'm not really that qualified to
 
01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
comment on whether the you know
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
compensation is appropriate or not I'll
 
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
probably follow the committee
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation but
 
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
I just want to say that it's it's one of
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
those where it's really hard to do it
 
01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
and frankly the fact that we are having
 
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
a hard time getting people to serve is a
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%

by representative evil
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
so this is a very simple bill that just
 
01:38:36.770 --> 01:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
changes some titles in uh in the law for
 
01:38:41.090 --> 01:38:41.100 align:start position:0%

01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
the information technology department
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
um the these employees are already hired
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
they're already in this position it's
 
01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
just a matter of giving them an official
 
01:38:54.290 --> 01:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
title uh in the law so this could easily

with water assistance for natural
 
01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
disasters and like to recognize
 
01:40:44.450 --> 01:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
chairman I move in expedient to

chairman I move in expedient to
legislate

01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
is there a second representative Griffin
 
01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:53.689 align:start position:0%
is there a second representative Griffin
so

01:40:53.689 --> 01:40:53.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
this bill has a sort of laudable purpose
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
but it has two major flaws in in my mind
 
01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
so what it does is it um allocates five
 
01:41:09.410 --> 01:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars and puts it into a
 
01:41:13.850 --> 01:41:13.860 align:start position:0%
special fund that would be used for
 
01:41:15.550 --> 01:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
um to assist
 
01:41:18.770 --> 01:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
low-income homeowners if they're
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
drinking water supply was interrupted by
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
a natural disaster
 
01:41:28.610 --> 01:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
so apparently this has happened in the
 
01:41:32.570 --> 01:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
past via the drought which hopefully is
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
over at this point
 
01:41:38.570 --> 01:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
um and and Des used money
 
01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
more General drinking fund money
 
01:41:45.250 --> 01:41:45.260 align:start position:0%
drinking water money to to implement
 
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
something like this particular program
 
01:41:51.410 --> 01:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
but this creates something new creates a
 
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
new fund and so on
 
01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.770 align:start position:0%
new fund and so on
so

01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:58.729 --> 01:41:58.739 align:start position:0%
um the two problems are one is it's
 
01:42:01.129 --> 01:42:01.139 align:start position:0%
creating a bucket of money that's very
 
01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
special purpose right it has to be for
 
01:42:07.010 --> 01:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
low income for drinking water created
 
01:42:09.169 --> 01:42:09.179 align:start position:0%
with where the problem was created by a
 
01:42:10.729 --> 01:42:10.739 align:start position:0%
natural disaster
 
01:42:13.129 --> 01:42:13.139 align:start position:0%
but if you think about it
 
01:42:16.490 --> 01:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
you generally don't want disaster money
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
to be to be bucketed in that way you
 
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
would rather have a very large pool of
 
01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
money to deal with natural disasters
 
01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
because you don't know ahead of time
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
what kind of a disaster it's going to be
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
and what it's going to affect so for
 
01:42:34.010 --> 01:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
example if you had a large fire or
 
01:42:36.770 --> 01:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
something you couldn't use the money in
 
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
this fund for that because this fund
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
would be very targeted and so rather
 
01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
than having this money in the special
 
01:42:47.330 --> 01:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
fund that's sort of what the rainy day
 
01:42:50.570 --> 01:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
fund is for right we we would we would
 
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
if we don't spend the money this way and
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
we don't spend it in any other way it
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
would end up in the rainy day fund the
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund is a general purpose fund
 
01:43:03.530 --> 01:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
for disasters and other special
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances right so so it doesn't
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
really make sense to have you know try
 
01:43:12.410 --> 01:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
to think of all possible kinds of
 
01:43:14.930 --> 01:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
disastrous circumstances and have a
 
01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
special pot of money for each one that's
 
01:43:19.490 --> 01:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
the main problem there's also a problem
 
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
in is in that in my mind this bill
 
01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.950 align:start position:0%
in is in that in my mind this bill
violates

01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
violates
 
01:43:29.090 --> 01:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
um house rule 45d which says that we
 
01:43:30.490 --> 01:43:30.500 align:start position:0%
should not be
 
01:43:33.770 --> 01:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
issuing broad rulemaking authority to
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
departments uh we shouldn't have bills
 
01:43:38.990 --> 01:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
with broad rulemaking Authority this
 
01:43:42.290 --> 01:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
bill does not specify the meaning of low
 
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
income so what what income level would
 
01:43:48.530 --> 01:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
count the amount of Any Given award you
 
01:43:50.209 --> 01:43:50.219 align:start position:0%
know what what limits there might be on
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
the award this doesn't specify exactly
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
what's meant by a disaster
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
how the money would be used
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
Etc so this just basically it it also
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
gives Des the ability to use the money
 
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
in the fund for their expenses but it
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't say you know limited to five
 
01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
percent or something like that right so
 
01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
there's no limits on the amount of money
 
01:44:17.149 --> 01:44:17.159 align:start position:0%
that could be used for their expenses so
 
01:44:19.729 --> 01:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
so in general this is what this is a
 
01:44:22.970 --> 01:44:22.980 align:start position:0%
classic broad rulemaking Authority uh
 
01:44:26.209 --> 01:44:26.219 align:start position:0%
Bill and and again that's that's against
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
house rules in in my reading so for all
 
01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
those reasons I think this should be in
 
01:44:33.290 --> 01:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate thank you Mr
 
01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:35.090 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate thank you Mr
chairman

01:44:35.090 --> 01:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:44:41.689 --> 01:44:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:44.270 --> 01:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative hack and Phillips thank
 
01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I just want to mention that
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
you'll see at the top of the co-sponsor
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
list that I am one of the co-sponsors
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
01:44:55.729 --> 01:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
and you know something that hasn't been
 
01:44:58.609 --> 01:44:58.619 align:start position:0%
discussed yet at this point although it
 
01:45:01.129 --> 01:45:01.139 align:start position:0%
was discussed in the original policy
 
01:45:03.649 --> 01:45:03.659 align:start position:0%
committee which passed
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
um or I'm sorry I think it was tied and
 
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
it came to the floor and passed
 
01:45:11.450 --> 01:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
um is that you know we have a housing
 
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
affordability and housing crisis on our
 
01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:15.290 align:start position:0%
affordability and housing crisis on our
hands

01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
hands
 
01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
um here in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
and given the real
 
01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:21.530 align:start position:0%
and given the real
um

01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:24.530 --> 01:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
real effects of the continuing drought
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
in our state especially in the Southern
 
01:45:26.159 --> 01:45:27.169 align:start position:0%
in our state especially in the Southern
Tier

01:45:27.169 --> 01:45:27.179 align:start position:0%
Tier
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
we know that there are several
 
01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
low-income families who are really
 
01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
struggling with this issue
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
and that you know any step that we can
 
01:45:38.109 --> 01:45:38.119 align:start position:0%
take any tool we can put in our toolbox
 
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
to assist those folks to stay in their
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
homes where they are to be able to have
 
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
drinking water
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
um reinstated or you know repaired is a
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
huge step in the right direction for our
 
01:45:54.290 --> 01:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
communities and our state
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
um so I have a hard time
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
um although I do understand the
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
important arguments representative
 
01:46:05.090 --> 01:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
McGuire outlined today
 
01:46:07.370 --> 01:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
um that five million dollars to assist
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
these really needy folks is an important
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction
 
01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
um for that reason I believe that
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna have to say no to the vote
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
of itl and
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
um support the my the Primary Response
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
are as well as my co-sponsors for the
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
initial idea and hope that you know if
 
01:46:30.910 --> 01:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
retention is a better
 
01:46:33.169 --> 01:46:33.179 align:start position:0%
outcome from this committee I think that
 
01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
it's worthy of discussion
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
um for those exact reasons thank you Mr
 
01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:39.470 align:start position:0%
um for those exact reasons thank you Mr
chair

01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:46:41.930 --> 01:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
01:46:44.450 --> 01:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
chair so so
 
01:46:46.129 --> 01:46:46.139 align:start position:0%
um the representative just brought up
 
01:46:49.129 --> 01:46:49.139 align:start position:0%
retentions I'm I'm curious if there was
 
01:46:52.550 --> 01:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
a discussion in the division on why not
 
01:46:56.090 --> 01:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
just retain it and work on it and if we
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead and and pass it itl I wonder if
 
01:47:01.609 --> 01:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
on the house floor if a tabling motion
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
might not be better so that the
 
01:47:06.649 --> 01:47:06.659 align:start position:0%
representative can work on it and maybe
 
01:47:10.370 --> 01:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
reintroduce it in January
 
01:47:12.169 --> 01:47:12.179 align:start position:0%
yes uh well thank you for that
 
01:47:12.179 --> 01:47:13.729 align:start position:0%
yes uh well thank you for that
suggestion

01:47:13.729 --> 01:47:13.739 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
um I guess
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
it just seemed like it needed too much
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
work for us to retain it and do it in
 
01:47:22.490 --> 01:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
our committee or in division especially
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
all the the definitions and the rule
 
01:47:28.669 --> 01:47:28.679 align:start position:0%
making and that sort of stuff but yes I
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
would support a tabling motion on the
 
01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:32.030 align:start position:0%
would support a tabling motion on the
floor

01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:47:40.189 --> 01:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:40.199 --> 01:47:41.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:47:41.450 --> 01:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
I know that there is a special committee
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
assigned to this body to discuss this
 
01:47:48.649 --> 01:47:48.659 align:start position:0%
exact issue that I raised about the
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
housing affordability and housing crisis
 
01:47:53.090 --> 01:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
issue and my
 
01:47:55.729 --> 01:47:55.739 align:start position:0%
instinct is to say um of course that a
 
01:47:58.729 --> 01:47:58.739 align:start position:0%
retention of the spill to work on some
 
01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
of the concerns representative McGuire
 
01:48:04.129 --> 01:48:04.139 align:start position:0%
just raised uh would be an important
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
tool in their toolbox to address the
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
issue if we kill it am I correct that
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
there if we vote to itl today am I
 
01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
correct that this would be a forbidden
 
01:48:16.609 --> 01:48:16.619 align:start position:0%
topic for that special committee to even
 
01:48:16.619 --> 01:48:18.770 align:start position:0%
topic for that special committee to even
consider

01:48:18.770 --> 01:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
if if it if Ito prevails they the
 
01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
subject matter could still be discussed
 
01:48:28.129 --> 01:48:28.139 align:start position:0%
but not the specifics of the bill if it
 
01:48:30.290 --> 01:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
was if itl prevailed but if it went to
 
01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%

01:51:06.649 --> 01:51:06.659 align:start position:0%
bill under discussion presently
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman you're right about
 
01:51:13.970 --> 01:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
the confusion and I have to thank
 
01:51:16.129 --> 01:51:16.139 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney for his efforts
 
01:51:18.050 --> 01:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
on this and this is again
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
relative to the admission of commercial
 
01:51:23.930 --> 01:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
property assessed clean energy sea pace
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
and like to recognize representative
 
01:51:27.770 --> 01:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
Sweeney thank you very much
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative Mr chairman so this
 
01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
amendment seeks to fix the bill
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
um and to give background on it this
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
bill passed out of the science
 
01:51:40.129 --> 01:51:40.139 align:start position:0%
technology and energy committee 15 to 5
 
01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:43.139 align:start position:0%
with bipartisan support for the C PACE
 
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
program it originally had a real fiscal
 
01:51:49.010 --> 01:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
note but in the amended process in the
 
01:51:51.530 --> 01:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
first committee policy committee uh the
 
01:51:53.689 --> 01:51:53.699 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of the state was severely
 
01:51:56.450 --> 01:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
limited or wiped out it's enabling
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
legislation now for municipalities to
 
01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
adopt a sea pass a commercial uh
 
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
Pace Loan program for uh
 
01:52:10.189 --> 01:52:10.199 align:start position:0%
clean energy projects that they may
 
01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
pursue it's really built for
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are populations over
 
01:52:17.629 --> 01:52:17.639 align:start position:0%
50 000 so it's really two municipalities
 
01:52:19.010 --> 01:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire that could
 
01:52:20.810 --> 01:52:20.820 align:start position:0%
even take advantage of this enabling
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
legislation the reason for the amendment
 
01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
that I'll move 692 H
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
is because when they amended it in the
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
first committee they essentially made
 
01:52:34.729 --> 01:52:34.739 align:start position:0%
some issues with the banking system in
 
01:52:36.649 --> 01:52:36.659 align:start position:0%
which the C Pace loan was going to have
 
01:52:39.590 --> 01:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
the priority lien on a property above
 
01:52:42.350 --> 01:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
the mortgage or other any developmental
 
01:52:44.270 --> 01:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
loans that the the developer the
 
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
property owner took out which is not how
 
01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
we want they didn't look at the banking
 
01:52:51.649 --> 01:52:51.659 align:start position:0%
elements of it and I spoke with the
 
01:52:54.109 --> 01:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
chair of Science and Technology when
 
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
they had that conversation and they
 
01:52:57.709 --> 01:52:57.719 align:start position:0%
talked about amending the bill their
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
internal decision of their committee was
 
01:53:02.209 --> 01:53:02.219 align:start position:0%
to let Finance deal with that so I met
 
01:53:04.010 --> 01:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
with the the chairman of Science and
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
Technology the sponsor of the bill and
 
01:53:07.729 --> 01:53:07.739 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire Bankers
 
01:53:10.129 --> 01:53:10.139 align:start position:0%
Association to come up with this
 
01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
amendment to keep the existing policy
 
01:53:14.570 --> 01:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
and the enabling legislation and the
 
01:53:16.850 --> 01:53:16.860 align:start position:0%
underlying bill but strengthen it to
 
01:53:18.830 --> 01:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
protect New Hampshire Banks and and
 
01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
lenders so that they wouldn't have that
 
01:53:23.149 --> 01:53:23.159 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence from the original
 
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
version that or the original Amendment
 
01:53:29.330 --> 01:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
as House of the house I think I covered
 
01:53:32.570 --> 01:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
that it was a confusing issue in the
 
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
committee but I think this resolved it
 
01:53:37.390 --> 01:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
all so I would move adoption of
 
01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:40.510 align:start position:0%
all so I would move adoption of
amendment

01:53:40.510 --> 01:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:43.970 --> 01:53:43.980 align:start position:0%
