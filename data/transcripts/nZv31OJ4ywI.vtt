00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979 align:start position:0%
seeks to simplify the Law's language to
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
consistent with the cancellation
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
statutes applicable to the personal
 
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:56.660 align:start position:0%

that although Attorney James Fox the
 
00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
property Council director for the

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:10.019 align:start position:0%
okay so I can assume you're telling us
 
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
everything that Jim would also have told
 
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
us exactly yes we do have a question
 
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
representative Houghton
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you Mr chair and
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming to testify before
 
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
us uh you kind of went over this quickly
 
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
and I'd just like to double check in
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
several places workers compensation has
 
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
been stricken and property and casually
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
casualty has replaced that language
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
could you just remind me as to why that
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
has happened here
 
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
um this is in the third Mark third party
 
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.230 align:start position:0%
um this is in the third Mark third party
administrator

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
um statue and this just before the third
 
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
party administrator statute just
 
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
um only included workers compensation
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
third party administrators and this
 
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
makes it so that it will include all
 
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
third party administrators including
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
workers compensation third party
 
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
administrators for Pro for Property and
 
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
Casualty Insurance lines thank you sure
 
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:08.779 align:start position:0%
okay none uh
 
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
and uh okay Jim you got yourself up
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
there good
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
so um inviting up Jim Hayden
 
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
and I have no idea what his position is
 
00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
because he's signing up at
 
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:41.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
so close but yet so far I've unmuted
 
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.430 align:start position:0%
so close but yet so far I've unmuted
myself

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of community Jim
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%

I signed up uh in support of this bill
 
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.370 align:start position:0%
I signed up uh in support of this bill
but

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
I realized in signing up that I had
 
00:11:02.569 --> 00:11:02.579 align:start position:0%
missed the opportunity to provide
 
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
testimony on the website so I just am
 
00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:06.779 align:start position:0%
now doing it here because I do want to
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:10.620 align:start position:0%

then okay
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.730 align:start position:0%
all right is there any other discussion
uh

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.329 --> 00:11:29.339 align:start position:0%
uh I guess nobody has any questions for
 
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
you uh anybody else would like to weigh
 
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.170 align:start position:0%
 
hey

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
I guess we're all set all right
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
um see no more interest uh the
 
00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
uh so I'll close uh before I close the
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
public hearing uh the sheet has eight
 
00:11:59.630 --> 00:11:59.640 align:start position:0%

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
go a little faster you can put some on
 
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I actually I used the lubricant one
 
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
the one that's got comes on with a
 
00:13:59.329 --> 00:13:59.339 align:start position:0%
little roller you roll it yeah
 
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
basically the same stuff so
 
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
but it's our my problem is more more
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
when the temperature is Right close
 
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
around freezing it starts to stick to my
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
skis that's so that's really really neat
 
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
other one than that I have a nice thin
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
long ski so I go pretty fast
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%

okay

00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:30.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
well I should have known better how we
 
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
do that that one 15 minutes
 
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
probably this next one too
 
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:42.470 align:start position:0%
probably this next one too
but

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
I was kind of conscious of overloading
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
too many bills
 
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
it's hard to time them all perfectly
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
you've been doing pretty well I think so
 
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that we can get all our bills
 
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
heard in seven days is it's pretty
 
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
miraculous but we really have a really
 
00:29:06.169 --> 00:29:06.179 align:start position:0%
light low lighter than usual so
 
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
well that's for sure
 
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
people really did take into a in into
 
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
heart uh take to heart the uh suggestion
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
that we not put in
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of bills that probably need a lot
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
of work yeah
 
00:29:23.529 --> 00:29:23.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
I just wish people would call us call me
 
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
ahead of time or talk you know talk
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
before they put these bills in
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:39.299 align:start position:0%
because we really don't have time to
 
00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:42.059 align:start position:0%
amend bills yeah well it would be
 
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
helpful but
 
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
that's a really good idea though
 
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.570 align:start position:0%
that's a really good idea though
right

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a really good idea you know
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
in September of a campaign year
 
00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
everybody's out straight in October
 
00:30:00.409 --> 00:30:00.419 align:start position:0%
um I think it's hard for them to think
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
that far ahead
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
I've never introduced a bill because
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
there are so many bills that I mean this
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
is I've been here for 17 years I'm gonna
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
say you've been around because there are
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
way too many bills that are introduced
 
00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:18.179 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
um I can co-sponsor but
 
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
it takes a lot of time to follow a bell
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
or to you know bring it forward and
 
00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
really make it success and uh I'll give
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
that to I'll give that responsibility to
 
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:37.799 align:start position:0%
others and representative you're also on
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
the school board
 
00:30:42.889 --> 00:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
yeah three meetings this week yeah in
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester that's a a big school board
 
00:30:48.169 --> 00:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
all right so it's uh 9 31 so why don't

the second part of the bill
 
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
seeks to amend the commercial

requirement that ensure automatically
 
00:33:18.649 --> 00:33:18.659 align:start position:0%
issue a non-renewal notice to
 
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
policyholders where the premium will

increase more than 25 percent while
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
keeping the requirement that the insurer
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
provides 60 days notice to the policy
 
00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
holder if the premium increase is
 
00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
greater than 25 percent
 
00:33:30.539 --> 00:33:33.169 align:start position:0%
greater than 25 percent
um

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
the last part of the bill proposes the

00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
um but those those are all my comments
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm willing to take any questions
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%

we do representative Burroughs has a
question

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:27.419 align:start position:0%

sorry about that
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%

taking my question
 
00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:32.990 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
when I send a bill on QuickBooks for
 
00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
example I know whether a customer's
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
opened it or not and I'm wondering if
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
there's any thought to that kind of
 
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
provision so that you know that the
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
electronic notice has been received by
 
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
the customer
 
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
um the bill does propose that the um in
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
the in the proposed 420q that the
 
00:34:56.399 --> 00:34:57.230 align:start position:0%
the in the proposed 420q that the
um

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
that the insurer has to have standards
 
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
that they're confident that the um
 
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
the party who's signed up to receive the
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
dog documents electronically has
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
received them um and there's standards
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
that they're supposed to follow under
 
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
the 420 queue
 
00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:11.690 align:start position:0%
the 420 queue
um

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:15.420 align:start position:0%

um could you just say a little bit more
 
00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
about the process by which an individual
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh consumer uh elects whether to get uh
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's a lot this information

electronically or or uh by mail I just
 
00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:48.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
just the the insurance company would
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
have to show that they had obtained the
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
um insured or the party receiving uh the
 
00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
electronic notices consent to receive
 
00:35:58.849 --> 00:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
them that way
 
00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
and they would the insurance company
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
just uh would also have to
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
um allow a party to go back to receiving
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
paper notices if the party expressed a
 
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.609 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:16.619 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:21.660 align:start position:0%

my wife who's working downstairs so okay
 
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
committee uh Jim Hayden on behalf of
 
00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
State Farm insurance companies
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
um and I signed on um online in support
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
um this is an important goal for State
 
00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
Farm because it is uh committed to
 
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
updating and modernizing
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
um the laws throughout the country uh in
 
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
general and particularly in relation to
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
e-delivery of documents because frankly
 
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
this is uh as Miss Doherty indicated
 
00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
something that's entirely driven by the
 
00:37:59.450 --> 00:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
customers because that is the way they
 
00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
get their documents from many other
 
00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:05.300 align:start position:0%
companies many other types of companies
 
00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
and it really is the standard way that
 
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
they view information from all of their
 
00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:13.740 align:start position:0%
uh all of their companies all of their
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
places where they buy business you know
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's very convenient for them
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
because it allows them access to the
 
00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
information right in their hand where
 
00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:24.980 align:start position:0%
they typically interact with the world
 
00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:27.380 align:start position:0%
it allows them to store the information
 
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
uh in a way so that they have ready
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
access to it later on it saves them the
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
need to figure out when they get paper
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not they need to shred it
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
before they throw it away
 
00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
or they saves them the need to store it
 
00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
somewhere and let it accumulate in some
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
file draw that I think a lot of folks
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
have been cleaning out during this time
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
of being
 
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:54.980 align:start position:0%
locked at home
 
00:38:59.089 --> 00:38:59.099 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons I testify in
 
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
support of this bill but I also wanted
 
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
to to note a particular provision that
 
00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:08.060 align:start position:0%
Ms Doherty touched on and it relates to
 
00:39:11.329 --> 00:39:11.339 align:start position:0%
the requirement of a non-renewal notice
 
00:39:14.349 --> 00:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
in the event of an increase of premium
 
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
and as Ms Doherty noted the bills still
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
requires notice to the insurance excuse
 
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
me to the customer of a substantial
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
increase in premium but it allows the
 
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
insurance company to leave the words
 
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
non-renewal off the form because frankly
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
just because there's a substantial
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
increase in premium doesn't mean the
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
insurance company doesn't want to retain
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
that person as a customer they're just
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
notifying them of a substantial increase
 
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
in premium that information will be in
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
front of them it's not necessarily A
 
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
non-renewal so it eliminates a lot of
 
00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
confusion that is really the results of
 
00:39:59.810 --> 00:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
statutes that were drafted long ago and
 
00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
State Farm again supports this aspect of
 
00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:06.020 align:start position:0%
the bill and the changes and in general
 
00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
we support this bill as a whole so thank
 
00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and I will take any
 
00:40:18.849 --> 00:40:18.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay is anybody have any questions
 
00:40:26.569 --> 00:40:26.579 align:start position:0%
I must say getting a 25 increase sounds
 
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
like non-renewal to me but I understand
 
00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:29.750 align:start position:0%
like non-renewal to me but I understand
that

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
we want to be appropriate to how we
 
00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
label the form so that people know that
 
00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
we didn't really mean to scare you away
 
00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
right it was an automatic when the
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
market changes yeah
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative Abel has a question
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
and and I apologize I probably should
 
00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
have asked this uh to the insurance
 
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
department but uh as far as I can tell
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
this has nothing to do with billing
 
00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
methods of building it's only notices is
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:06.740 align:start position:0%
um certainly the um
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
the uh excuse me I believe I believe
 
00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
that the general delivery of documents
 
00:41:14.089 --> 00:41:14.099 align:start position:0%
includes billing
 
00:41:14.099 --> 00:41:18.650 align:start position:0%
includes billing
okay

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else have any questions for
 
00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:24.540 align:start position:0%

all right so uh anybody else who's an
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
as you're all just listening in okay
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
great all right so if there are no more
 
00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.430 align:start position:0%
great all right so if there are no more

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:02.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:08.180 align:start position:0%
we have uh six in support no opposed and
 
00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:14.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.130 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
I have a feeling we we have another
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
weight again okay till 10 o'clock
 
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
all right well another 15 minutes I
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
guess we've got plenty of coffee breaks
 
00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.430 align:start position:0%
guess we've got plenty of coffee breaks
today

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes
 
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
um if you like
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
um we could try test drive the screen
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
sharing that I'm mentioned just to make
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
sure sure
 
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
okay so this is a presentation you would
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
want to make okay sure it seems it seems
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
that I have permission yes okay so
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
let's see how this works let me
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
I think the key to screen sharing is
 
00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
making sure you don't have other screens
 
00:43:17.089 --> 00:43:17.099 align:start position:0%
open that aren't really appropriate for
 
00:43:17.099 --> 00:43:18.550 align:start position:0%
open that aren't really appropriate for
sure

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
you start there right and then desktop
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
let's go
 
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
it work I I can see a license plate a
 
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
Nissan you and you blotched out the
 
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
license plate number too of course
 
00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.410 align:start position:0%
license plate number too of course
maintain

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
privacy yes so that that does seem to
 
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
work and you want to just scroll the
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
next page just to make sure everything's
 
00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.730 align:start position:0%
next page just to make sure everything's
sure

00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
I'll go backwards
 
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
or is that the last one yeah there you
 
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:13.380 align:start position:0%
how many how many slides not many
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.730 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:22.849 --> 00:44:22.859 align:start position:0%
um it seems it works okay oh so I will
 
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
stop the screens here and George russos
 
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
has raised his hand
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
so uh it's because that's his car
 
00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure he doesn't drive a
 
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:40.190 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure he doesn't drive a
Nissan

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
okay George I've loaded you up to the
 
00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
you have a question George
 
00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
maybe he wasn't expecting to do that
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
he was just playing with buttons all
 
00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
right I get it well
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm glad I tried it out because I'm
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
hoping to testify this afternoon thank
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman Mr Vice chairman Mr
 
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:29.579 align:start position:0%
Hayden that was my car uh
 
00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:32.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for using it and blocking out
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
the license plate I appreciate that too
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
so the way this works I guess is
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
Lindsay's not here to tell me uh I
 
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
raised my hair
 
00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
and then I wait for about an hour and
 
00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:47.339 align:start position:0%
then I see the thing about on Muni if I
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
want to and I and I click it is that how
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
it works so
 
00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
um I I sent the unmute because there was
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
a little delay
 
00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
um you're supposed to know that uh right
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
now you're you're in control of your own
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
muting you know numbers I'm it's one
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
less task for me to worry about okay I
 
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
know I'd like to say I can mute people
 
00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
if I want to but I I try not to unmute
 
00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
them without them sure sure no but I
 
00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
didn't see the mute sign up but I'll
 
00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
work on that between now and uh this
 
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
afternoon okay thank you for the
 
00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:23.420 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman Mr Vice chairman
 
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
Happy New Year
 
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
same to you same to you I wish we were
 
00:46:33.609 --> 00:46:33.619 align:start position:0%
in person someday that'll happen yeah
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
all right well I'm gonna
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh stop my video and mute myself okay
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
yeah uh I'm gonna I'm gonna throw you
 
00:46:44.569 --> 00:46:44.579 align:start position:0%
back over to attendees you and Jim I'm
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
gonna throw you back over to these
 
00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
but generally I will I'm I'm getting
 
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
pretty good at it I'm moving I'll move
 
00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
people up before I announce your name so
 
00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
you know you'll see that it you when you
 
00:46:59.690 --> 00:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
get moved over but that I um I try to do
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
it ahead of time so we don't have that
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
lag so I just need to learn where the
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
mute sign is when I uh after I raise my
 
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.630 align:start position:0%
mute sign is when I uh after I raise my
hand

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
you have it on your screen right are you
 
00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
CC okay so I I'm I'm less less uh
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
educated about a PC but sure I see on
 
00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:23.420 align:start position:0%
the lower left right now I've got it
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
right so that's usually there and then
 
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
actually if you point on your screen
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
yourself your own screen if you move
 
00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
your arrow onto your own screen
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
yeah oh I see got another view so that's
 
00:47:38.329 --> 00:47:38.339 align:start position:0%
the second mute button and then a fairly
 
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
new computer like I do uh there's a bar
 
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
you know on our Macs and I assume the
 
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
PCS have something similar to a bar
 
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
which will the mute button will also
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
appear there so there are multiple
 
00:47:53.809 --> 00:47:53.819 align:start position:0%
muting Roots great okay can you uh Mr
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
chairman can you forecast at all what
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
the hearings look like at uh I noticed
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
we've got uh at two o'clock you've got
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill 310 the auto repair
 
00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
you and Jim really care about so I I
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
would say at this moment
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
um I do not have it because the list on

Chris yeah hi Chris uh yeah I'm reading
 
00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
this uh the next bill I think it is uh I
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
hope we're getting I'm I'm uh I have to
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh admit to ignorance here and it seems
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
like there's three or four different
 
00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.470 align:start position:0%
like there's three or four different
references

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
references
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh 501c3 50 something M5 and so I hope
 
00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
that somebody that's going to sit down
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
and explain this legislation to us gets
 
00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
gets at least me up the stream I I
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's a charitable I don't know about
 
00:58:08.809 --> 00:58:08.819 align:start position:0%
charitable gift giving and annuities
 
00:58:11.089 --> 00:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
stuff so
 
00:58:13.329 --> 00:58:13.339 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to keep my mouth shut but
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
but I'm just warning you ahead of time I
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
want to be able to understand this a bit
 
00:58:20.109 --> 00:58:20.119 align:start position:0%
better than whatever
 
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
Chris did you print out the example that
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
was sent by representative infantine
 
00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
um no I don't know where he sent it he
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
said emailed it so um
 
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
you might want to look at that and he's
 
00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment all right I I had I haven't
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
read Will's uh memo I don't know
 
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:45.180 align:start position:0%
what well that would help you prepare
 
00:58:48.049 --> 00:58:48.059 align:start position:0%
for it yes but I get I have four email
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
accounts and the one I use the most
 
00:58:52.849 --> 00:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
we've talked about that over and over
 
00:58:54.289 --> 00:58:54.299 align:start position:0%
you've got to get in touch with the
 
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
clerk so that only one get you gets used
 
00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
all right Chris just follow our lead
 
00:59:04.849 --> 00:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
I will I mean I'm just warning everybody
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
I don't want to be uh you know I
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
probably won't say a word but uh just
 
00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:12.299 align:start position:0%
warning the chairman that I'm
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
right at this point in time I'm I'm in
 
00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:16.140 align:start position:0%
the dark
 
00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:19.190 align:start position:0%
the dark
okay

00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
fair enough all right uh so let me go
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
over here
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:30.839 --> 00:59:32.390 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
we'll open up the public hearing on
 
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
House Bill 527 and hear from
 
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor will inventine
 
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman uh members of
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm going to be with you
 
00:59:48.829 --> 00:59:48.839 align:start position:0%
folks for the next hour and 15 minutes I
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
will try to make it extremely painless I
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
am very apologetic as to what happened
 
00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:55.799 align:start position:0%
with House Bill 527 I submitted this to
 
00:59:59.089 --> 00:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
OLS a few months ago and it was not
 
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
noticed uh by my constituent until like
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
Friday that it really wasn't written as
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
presented and it was actually a bad Bill
 
01:00:10.849 --> 01:00:10.859 align:start position:0%
as initially presented house bill 527.
 
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
so I've been working with the Department
 
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
of Justice Tom Donovan I've been working
 
01:00:16.609 --> 01:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
with um
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
my constituent and we've made a number
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
of changes I will give you a brief
 
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
overview of what this bill is about but
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
first let me introduce myself my name is
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
Will infantine of state representative
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
from Manchester award six which is
 
01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 13. I've been at the licensed
 
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:31.260 align:start position:0%

01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for 32 years
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
um I do not
 
01:00:37.549 --> 01:00:37.559 align:start position:0%
um I'm not licensed nor do I sell
 
01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:39.059 align:start position:0%
anything to do with any kind of
 
01:00:39.059 --> 01:00:40.670 align:start position:0%
anything to do with any kind of
annuities

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
annuities
 
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
um but let me explain how I think most
 
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:44.220 align:start position:0%
of you know how some of these things
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
work uh you will place certain money
 
01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
into an account with either a charity or
 
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
a an insurance company and they will
 
01:00:53.569 --> 01:00:53.579 align:start position:0%
give you a contract that states you will
 
01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:55.140 align:start position:0%
receive a certain amount of money back
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
every month for a certain period of time
 
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
until it either runs out or it could be
 
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
you know until until your death and
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
those are very well regulated Actuarial
 
01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:07.740 align:start position:0%
tables are put together to make sure
 
01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
that everyone understands exactly what
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
money they're putting in and what they
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
get back in return
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
most of them are guaranteed by insurance
 
01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:17.579 align:start position:0%
carriers who have lots of money because
 
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
one of the most important thing we want
 
01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
to do here when we we the government
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
sells any kind of or approves any kind
 
01:01:26.569 --> 01:01:26.579 align:start position:0%
of an annuity is to make sure that there
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
is enough money to pay the individual
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
you signed a contract you put money in
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
you expect money out
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
um and and um
 
01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
that's you know the way the way it's
 
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
supposed to work
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
um I Mr chairman can you see me you're
 
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
Frozen and I just want to make sure I am
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
not frozen okay very well you were just
 
01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:47.099 align:start position:0%
being being really cool there
 
01:01:47.099 --> 01:01:47.650 align:start position:0%
being being really cool there
um

01:01:47.650 --> 01:01:47.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
yes so um so what the the there are
 
01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
certain charitable annuities there are
 
01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
allowed you take a large Hospital which
 
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
might be a 501c3
 
01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:00.740 align:start position:0%
um Mr Herbert and um
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
you want to be able to donate some money
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
to that hospital yet get some money back
 
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
the difference between a regular annuity
 
01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
and a charitable annuity is if I'm going
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
to go out and buy an annuity I'm going
 
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
to check out every insurance company to
 
01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:14.700 align:start position:0%
make sure I get the best deal for the
 
01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
money I'm putting in for the longest
 
01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:17.579 align:start position:0%
period of time whether it's a short
 
01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
period of time and a longer a better
 
01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
monthly return or a smaller monthly
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
return in a longer period of time but I
 
01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
can make that decision on a charitable
 
01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
one you're basically making a decision
 
01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
to take less I'm going to take less per
 
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
month for the money I'm putting in so if
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
I'm putting in fifty thousand dollars to
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
this charitable annuity I'm going to
 
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
take a little less back per month but
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
some of the extra money
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
that's going to be left at the end I'm
 
01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
going to give to the charity in a
 
01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
response and as a result of that I'm
 
01:02:48.049 --> 01:02:48.059 align:start position:0%
going to get a tax deduction which is I
 
01:02:50.569 --> 01:02:50.579 align:start position:0%
want now I want my tax deduction now and
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
the charity gets some money
 
01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:54.839 align:start position:0%
however to do that we want to make sure
 
01:02:56.569 --> 01:02:56.579 align:start position:0%
that that charity has enough money to
 
01:02:58.609 --> 01:02:58.619 align:start position:0%
fulfill the contract so we make sure
 
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
they have three hundred thousand dollars
 
01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.690 align:start position:0%
they have three hundred thousand dollars
in

01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:01.700 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
liquid assets that are unrestricted and
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
all these other things
 
01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea it's a super concept
 
01:03:10.609 --> 01:03:10.619 align:start position:0%
we are not changing that law The
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
Proposal here is to say what do we do
 
01:03:14.089 --> 01:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
for small Charities a group of hockey
 
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
teams a a group a a non-profit uh um
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%
Charter School
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
um any kind of other small charity that
 
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
many of you may volunteer or donate to
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
something that's going to help help
 
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:28.140 align:start position:0%
um kids with special needs or any of
 
01:03:29.809 --> 01:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
those type of things but they don't have
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
that three hundred thousand dollars in
 
01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
restricted cash they can't do this so
 
01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
the goal here is very simple
 
01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
to allow smaller Charities to be able to
 
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
do the same thing
 
01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
however the requirements are they only
 
01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
have 25
 
01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
000 in restricted cash but because we
 
01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that they can pay this
 
01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
contract they have to go find an
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
insurance company to pack it
 
01:03:53.569 --> 01:03:53.579 align:start position:0%
okay so they can't just do it on their
 
01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
own like some of the bigger Charities
 
01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:56.030 align:start position:0%
own like some of the bigger Charities
can

01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
they have someone else an insurance
 
01:03:59.809 --> 01:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
company to back it and then that charity
 
01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
gets that that difference between uh as
 
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
I said the example
 
01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
you have you're taking a lesser return
 
01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
on your investment and the charity gets
 
01:04:15.289 --> 01:04:15.299 align:start position:0%
that money
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
that is simplistically what we want to
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
do here we're not changing the existing
 
01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
law to cut into the Charities that have
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
ability to do this if they have over 300
 
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:28.140 align:start position:0%
000 restricted cash we're not trying to
 
01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
um do anything that is not
 
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
I'm going to protect the investment of
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
the individual I talked to the insurance
 
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
commissioner yesterday they understand
 
01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
that they would be still in charge of
 
01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
these insurance companies
 
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
um that would be backing
 
01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
um these charitable annuities
 
01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
there is an example a financial planner
 
01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
by the name of Steve Matthew has signed
 
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
up to speak he will be explaining the
 
01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
example that was sent and how it works
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
Tom Donovan from the Department of
 
01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.089 align:start position:0%
Tom Donovan from the Department of
Justice

01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
01:04:58.849 --> 01:04:58.859 align:start position:0%
um has some questions
 
01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
um that I've been trying to fix in these
 
01:05:03.289 --> 01:05:03.299 align:start position:0%
amendments with OLS
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
um instead of the original Bill if
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
you've looked at it folks it kind of
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
groups everything together and that just
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
muddied the water instead we've created
 
01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
an entire new section Roman numeral six
 
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:18.299 align:start position:0%
just for these smaller annuities it's as
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
simple as that I'd like to make it so
 
01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
it's perfect
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
so there's no questions there's no
 
01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
arguments everyone is protected and it
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
just allows for other smaller Charities
 
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
to do this this is not a novel idea this
 
01:05:34.490 --> 01:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
is allowed in a number of states
 
01:05:36.049 --> 01:05:36.059 align:start position:0%
um I'd be willing to take any questions
 
01:05:39.049 --> 01:05:39.059 align:start position:0%
but I do know that Tom Donovan from the
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice will weigh in and
 
01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
I also know Steve Matthew will weigh in
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
and hopefully answer any of your
 
01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
specific questions I am not a financial
 
01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.630 align:start position:0%
specific questions I am not a financial
planner

01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
planner
 
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
I am over my head on the really in the
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
weeds thing on this one and that's why I
 
01:05:55.609 --> 01:05:55.619 align:start position:0%
will allow those folks to speak but Mr
 
01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
chairman keeping things quickly as I
 
01:05:59.210 --> 01:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
always try to do for your very busy
 
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
committee I would be happy to accept any
 
01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:02.630 align:start position:0%
committee I would be happy to accept any
questions

01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
okay we do have a question from Anita
 
01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.289 align:start position:0%
okay we do have a question from Anita
Burroughs

01:06:06.289 --> 01:06:06.299 align:start position:0%
Burroughs
 
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for taking my
 
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.130 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for taking my
question

01:06:10.130 --> 01:06:10.140 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
you may be able to
 
01:06:14.089 --> 01:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
want to defer to Tom Donovan just just
 
01:06:14.099 --> 01:06:15.289 align:start position:0%
want to defer to Tom Donovan just just
quickly

01:06:15.289 --> 01:06:15.299 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:06:18.049 --> 01:06:18.059 align:start position:0%
um the it sounds very reasonable I like
 
01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:20.819 align:start position:0%
the bill my only question is why did you
 
01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:23.339 align:start position:0%
come up with the one that the charity
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
had to be in operation for one year
 
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
because that that kind of scares me
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
because uh there are a lot of small
 
01:06:33.049 --> 01:06:33.059 align:start position:0%
Charities that come along and are flaky
 
01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:36.500 align:start position:0%
and and are gone very quickly
 
01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.029 align:start position:0%
and and are gone very quickly
representative

01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
um I wanted because of that exactly that
 
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
comments that are flaky and come and go
 
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
we wanted didn't want someone to quote
 
01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
unquote create a charity today and then
 
01:06:49.609 --> 01:06:49.619 align:start position:0%
started then try to do one of these
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
things we wanted someone to be in in
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
business for a number of years as a
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
charity to prove themselves now if you
 
01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
would like to increase that uh I'm not
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
going to have any problems someone
 
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
should be in business as a charity for
 
01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
three years or something uh to prove
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
their uh worth I have no issue with that
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%

uh most recently the New Hampshire
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
Legends of hockey I was instrumental in
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
forming uh three different charities the
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
Saint Catherine School charitable
 
01:08:06.289 --> 01:08:06.299 align:start position:0%
Foundation the St Joseph's Junior
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%

advised funds for uh individuals who are
 
01:08:20.809 --> 01:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
higher net worth individuals uh the
 
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:22.980 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill is really to to help
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
some of these smaller institutional
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
Charities like for example the Saint
 
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
Catherine school or the New Hampshire
 
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:31.799 align:start position:0%
Legends of hockey or friends of Central
 
01:08:35.329 --> 01:08:35.339 align:start position:0%
Hockey to raise money and one of the
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
tools that's uh that in our work with a
 
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
lot of senior citizens is they they
 
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
would like to find a way to make gifts
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
that that could benefit them but at the
 
01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
same time uh benefit their small
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
Charities and so uh I gave you an
 
01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:50.759 align:start position:0%
example and I don't know if you all have
 
01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
that example in your hands but basically
 
01:08:54.769 --> 01:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
I would just want to run through quickly
 
01:08:56.689 --> 01:08:56.699 align:start position:0%
what it means what it looks like and how
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
it works in essence here we took a 70
 
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
year old individual I show it with a 100
 
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
000 donation well this individual would
 
01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
get a 4.7 percent distribution for the
 
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
rest of his life do any of you know
 
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
where you can get 4.7 percent on your
 
01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:14.660 align:start position:0%
money today
 
01:09:17.209 --> 01:09:17.219 align:start position:0%
guaranteed all right and the fact is it
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist but in a charitable gift
 
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
annuity what they're in essence doing is
 
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
they're taking this and they taking the
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
Actuarial value of this individual and
 
01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
they're paying it out over his life
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
expectancy now the difference is if they
 
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
were to take that same hundred thousand
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
dollars and go to a commercial insurance
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
carrier on their own they'd get
 
01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
approximately 5.4 percent so to be
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
getting more money but they're willing
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
to accept a little bit less here and the
 
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
reason is and I'm going to go down on
 
01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
the screen to the reason is because
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
they're going to get a 36 000 tax
 
01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
deduction on this gift
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
because that's the net present value of
 
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
the remainder interest that would be
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
left to the charity now if we implement
 
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
this bill what happens is uh the charity
 
01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
would then have to go out no if it's a
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
if it's a very large charity and they
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
were issuing this themselves uh that 36
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
000 would basically be frozen there and
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be able to touch any of
 
01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
that money until such time as that
 
01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
individual died
 
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
and with the small Charities you're not
 
01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
helping them a bit by doing this because
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
they can't even issue it unless they've
 
01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
got 300 000 unrestricted cash so what
 
01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
the bill does is it basically does two
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
things but a large Charities it allows
 
01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
them to commercially insure it which
 
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
would allow them the ability to take
 
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
that residual value and use that either
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
for current use or put it into their
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
endowment funds and it would do the
 
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
small the same thing for the small
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
Charities as well now uh Tom uh Donovan
 
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
had raised some issues which I think are
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
very valid uh it said well
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
um uh you know some of these larger
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
Donor advised foundations do this uh do
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
charitable gift annuities now and the
 
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
answer to that is uh yes some of them do
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of them do not a lot of them don't
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
simply because they don't want to be
 
01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
dealing with the uh Actuarial work and
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
the and the administrative work that's
 
01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
associated with administering charitable
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
gift annuities all right so if we bring
 
01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies into this which
 
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh are that's all they do is issue
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
annuities all day long uh then what
 
01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
we're doing is we're basically taking
 
01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
the risk off of this charity we're
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
allowing the charity to take advantage
 
01:11:29.209 --> 01:11:29.219 align:start position:0%
of this right away and to have a
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
residual balance that they can spend
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
right away because they're going to in
 
01:11:34.970 --> 01:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
this example I gave you uh the
 
01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
approximate cost of the commercial
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
annuity would be 69 000 to fund that
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
forty seven hundred dollars a year for
 
01:11:43.729 --> 01:11:43.739 align:start position:0%
the rest of the life of that 70 year old
 
01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
all right they'd have Thirty one
 
01:11:47.209 --> 01:11:47.219 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that they could
 
01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
immediately expend for their benefit
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
so that's the purpose of what we're
 
01:11:53.330 --> 01:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
proposing here I want to give small
 
01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
Charities the ability to raise money and
 
01:11:58.610 --> 01:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
to get into uh and to build their their
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
endowments up if that's what they're
 
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:04.850 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
anybody patients in the committee um I I
 
01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
have a question yes sir representative
 
01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
yes uh Steve nice to see you again I
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if you recognize me I do
 
01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.910 align:start position:0%
don't know if you recognize me I do
Chris

01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
Chris
 
01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
um just a quick question does the small
 
01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
charity does that have to be a 501c3
 
01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
the the donor well the small charity
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
would have to be a 501c3 yes or if it's
 
01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
a Donor advised fund they're basically a
 
01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:36.659 align:start position:0%
a subgroup of a 501c3 so the answer is
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
in all cases yes in one way shape or
 
01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
form they're going to have to be
 
01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
affiliated with a charitable
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
organization that is a qualified charity
 
01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you uh very much for participating
 
01:12:52.570 --> 01:12:52.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh okay representative Fargo next
 
01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
the insurance company get paid gets paid
 
01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
for this and how much of the um
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
how much they make when they help these
 
01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.990 align:start position:0%
how much they make when they help these
charities

01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
charities
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
create these annuities
 
01:13:16.370 --> 01:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
yeah let me separate that into two
 
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
pieces uh the insurance company is
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
basically managing money and then they
 
01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
they're managing the Actuarial risk tip
 
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
the typical insurance company is working
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
on one to one and a half percent spreads
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
of the of the assets under management uh
 
01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
which is it was netting to them over a
 
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
long period of time uh and then if they
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
pay out a commission to an insurance
 
01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
agent on these immediate annuities
 
01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
typically they're paying insurance
 
01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
agents today somewhere around one and a
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
half percent uh Commission on the on on
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
the sale of these things if they if they
 
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
ran it through it through an insurance
 
01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:58.130 align:start position:0%
ran it through it through an insurance
agent

01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:59.930 --> 01:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
any other question
 
01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
all set yeah okay uh representative Abel
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much for you for
 
01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
testing uh for testifying uh I'm glad
 
01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
you mentioned risks uh risk because
 
01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
that's where what my question is
 
01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
um I wonder if you could tell us what
 
01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
the risks are for each of the parties uh
 
01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
I mean the worst case scenario I suppose
 
01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
um for the donor for the uh for the
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
charity and for the insurance company
 
01:14:34.729 --> 01:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if there's anyone else
 
01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
in there but I want to make sure that we
 
01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
understand that fully what kind of risk
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
each one is taking in this kind of
 
01:14:42.719 --> 01:14:44.209 align:start position:0%
each one is taking in this kind of
transaction

01:14:44.209 --> 01:14:44.219 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
01:14:44.219 --> 01:14:45.790 align:start position:0%
transaction
sure

01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
anytime somebody buys an annuity whether
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
it be a charitable gift annuity or
 
01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
whether it be a straight annuity with an
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
insurance company uh the basic risk that
 
01:14:59.930 --> 01:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
they have is the ability of the payor to
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
complete the transaction as promised and
 
01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
so with charitable gift annuities right
 
01:15:07.729 --> 01:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
now typically the only companies that
 
01:15:09.169 --> 01:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
are the typically the only Charities
 
01:15:12.169 --> 01:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
that issue are the very large ones with
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh millions of dollars in assets and the
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
reason for that is they have to have the
 
01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
ability to make those payments and
 
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
guarantee those payments over long
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
periods of time in the case of the
 
01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
insurance companies that's the business
 
01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
that they're in managing risk and any
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
business that's licensed in the state of
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for example any insurance
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
company in the state of New Hampshire uh
 
01:15:35.810 --> 01:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
is required to join the New Hampshire
 
01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
Insurance guarantee Association and if
 
01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
one should fail basically the others
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
have to make good on the obligations of
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
the one that failed up to a hundred
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars uh per account so
 
01:15:50.450 --> 01:15:50.460 align:start position:0%
um there's a certain amount of
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
guarantees that are built in whenever
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
somebody buys uh an annuity from an
 
01:15:59.090 --> 01:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
insurance company but when they buy from
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
a charitable gift annuity there really
 
01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
aren't any guarantees other than the uh
 
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:06.659 align:start position:0%
Financial wherewithal of that particular
 
01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
charitable organization in this case
 
01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is we're we're actually
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
adding uh we're adding safety a safety
 
01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
margin because when we have the
 
01:16:19.729 --> 01:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
insurance guarantee associations that
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
are at least providing for a portion of
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
the risk guarantee we're actually
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
putting the the purchasers in a better
 
01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
position than if they're buying outright
 
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
from a a large charitable organization
 
01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
that's solely relying on their own
 
01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:39.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bartlett I don't care
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:46.189 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
um so what happens if
 
01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
the charity is no longer it it's it
 
01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a charity that's
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
only been
 
01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
um in operation for at least one year
 
01:16:59.330 --> 01:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
so if the charity goes away and this
 
01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
annuities in place what happens to the
 
01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:04.850 align:start position:0%
annuities in place what happens to the
paths

01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
in in this particular example if we're
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
allowing an outside carrier to fund this
 
01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
thing then the individual would continue
 
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
to get their payments streamed uh
 
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
forever because in essence what we're
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
doing is we're we're subrogating that
 
01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
risk to a commercial insurance company
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
and so whether the donor gets their
 
01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
money right the donor continues to get
 
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
their payout
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
okay can I ask another question thank
 
01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:30.830 align:start position:0%
okay can I ask another question thank
you

01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
um so the donor gets their money
 
01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
the charitable organization gets all the
 
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
money up front is that correct well what
 
01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
they're getting is the the original the
 
01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
original donation comes into the charity
 
01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
up front but in order for them to be
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
able to issue that promised annuity they
 
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
have to immediately within five days
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
under this bill purchase that annuity
 
01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
from a commercial insurance carrier so
 
01:17:58.850 --> 01:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
it has to go out the door immediately
 
01:18:02.689 --> 01:18:02.699 align:start position:0%
to a commercial insurance carrier
 
01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
so for the charity okay I'm sorry I'm
 
01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
missing yeah the charity is then left
 
01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
with the residual balance
 
01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
so if you you look at the example that I
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
had sent up to you the residual balance
 
01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh the the present value of the
 
01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
remainder interest on the on the initial
 
01:18:24.410 --> 01:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
purchase is 36 000 but then we have to
 
01:18:26.209 --> 01:18:26.219 align:start position:0%
go out and buy an annuity that's going
 
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
to cost 69 000 to fund that to the
 
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
individual so they're only left with 31
 
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
000. so the charitable organization is
 
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
only left with a small percentage now
 
01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
this this percentage changes depending
 
01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
on the age of the individual that buys
 
01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
the annuity the older they are the
 
01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:47.699 align:start position:0%
greater the residual balance the younger
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
they are the less the residual balance
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
one more question another question being
 
01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
Claire so
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
the board of this charitable
 
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
organization needs to be
 
01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
pretty well informed in my and having
 
01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
been on many boards
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
thinking that many members would
 
01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
understand how this would take place
 
01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
is that fair that is absolutely fair and
 
01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
I would agree with you completely the uh
 
01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
the value that that happens now is that
 
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
if you have and there are financial
 
01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
advisors throughout the state and all
 
01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
over the country that are literally
 
01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
doing this they're advising their
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
clients to set up you know who who are
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
charitably inclined to set up these
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
types of things and basically those are
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
the people that are going to bring to
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
and educate the various boards as to a
 
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
way that they can raise funds for their
 
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
organization uh and do it simply and
 
01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
cost effectively
 
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
so it's going to be it'll be you know
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
there'll be financial advisors that will
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
basically consult and for the most part
 
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
most of the boards that I know of most
 
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
of the non-profit entities in New
 
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and all the ones that I've
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
worked on is usually always either an
 
01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
accountant a financial advisors or some
 
01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
Financial person serving on those boards
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
and so it would behoove them to have
 
01:20:14.450 --> 01:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
somebody of that nature who understands
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
these things working with them
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
one more question one further question
 
01:20:21.530 --> 01:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry
 
01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:22.850 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry
um

01:20:22.850 --> 01:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
I can see you know if you're talking
 
01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
about a church
 
01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
you have a pretty good chance of getting
 
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
a good Board of Trustees that may have
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
that expertise
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
you are on the Hockey Association board
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
but if you weren't there who on that you
 
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
know I'm not asking personal questions
 
01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:41.870 align:start position:0%
know I'm not asking personal questions
but

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
um would there be somebody else on on a
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
on say the hockey board that would
 
01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.450 align:start position:0%
on say the hockey board that would
understand

01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
this kind of transaction
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh many of the boards that I've worked
 
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
with uh for example I worked with Opera
 
01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we had a couple of lawyers
 
01:20:58.370 --> 01:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
on that board we had uh you know
 
01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
different people that were financially
 
01:21:03.649 --> 01:21:03.659 align:start position:0%
Savvy or or had a basic understanding
 
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
and and and truthfully when you sit down
 
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
and you you draw this out to somebody
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
and if I were to put this on kind of
 
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
boxes and graphs it's really a pretty
 
01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
easy concept to understand you know on
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
this particular chart I gave you there's
 
01:21:18.649 --> 01:21:18.659 align:start position:0%
way too many numbers on it and I'm only
 
01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:20.219 align:start position:0%
showing it because it came right off of
 
01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
the uh uh the the the pension not the
 
01:21:27.169 --> 01:21:27.179 align:start position:0%
pension but the uh uh plan giving Design
 
01:21:27.179 --> 01:21:28.610 align:start position:0%
pension but the uh uh plan giving Design
Center

01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
Center
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
calculator website and so I normally
 
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't show that to anybody but
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
basically uh what we want to know is
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
here's what you get here's what the
 
01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:39.719 align:start position:0%
charity gets and here's where the money
 
01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
goes and here's how the money comes into
 
01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
you and it's really a a it's not a
 
01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
complicated thing even though the
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
workings obviously there's Actuarial
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
calculations that go into this and uh
 
01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
those are the people behind the scenes
 
01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
doing that kind of stuff
 
01:21:57.649 --> 01:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else have any questions for
 
01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
Mr Matthew okay see none we thank you
 
01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony
 
01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
and uh I'll now invite Tom Donovan on
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
the charitable trust division of the
 
01:22:13.010 --> 01:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%

good morning uh Mr chairman and um thank
 
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
you to you and members of the committee
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak today I'm Tom
 
01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
Donovan I'm director of charitable
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
trusts at the Attorney General's office
 
01:22:29.689 --> 01:22:29.699 align:start position:0%
and um as is usually the case we are not
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this bill it's a
 
01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
policy matter for uh you and the
 
01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
committee to be considering we do have
 
01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:39.709 align:start position:0%
committee to be considering we do have
um questions

01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:39.719 align:start position:0%
um questions
 
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
um and concerns we want to alert you to
 
01:22:44.689 --> 01:22:44.699 align:start position:0%
as to one
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph of this uh proposal I think
 
01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
that um uh representative infantine and
 
01:22:54.649 --> 01:22:54.659 align:start position:0%
Mr uh Matthew explained pretty well what
 
01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
the intent of of this is our concern um
 
01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
um relates to it it's um it begins at
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
line 20 on the original Bill and then
 
01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
line or line nine of the amended bill
 
01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
and it's it's a sub paragraph two
 
01:23:16.610 --> 01:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
um but let me back up first to say so
 
01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:18.830 align:start position:0%
um but let me back up first to say so
why

01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
um do Charities issue charitable gifts
 
01:23:26.209 --> 01:23:26.219 align:start position:0%
annuity uh at some point back in time
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
some development officer at some charity
 
01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
thought this is another good way to
 
01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
raise money for your charity as I get
 
01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:34.370 align:start position:0%
raise money for your charity as I get
older

01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
older
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
um I get letters from my college
 
01:23:41.689 --> 01:23:41.699 align:start position:0%
uh trying to get me to buy a charitable
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
gift annuity to help my college and to
 
01:23:46.970 --> 01:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
help me in retirement other non-profits
 
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
do the same it's it's a good investment
 
01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
or it's a good fundraising vehicle it's
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
a little complicated but uh
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
um it's a way to provide an annuity to
 
01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
uh an individual and then also some
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
money gets spun off to the the
 
01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.709 align:start position:0%
money gets spun off to the the
non-profit

01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
non-profit
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
um so why then is charitable trust
 
01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:10.850 align:start position:0%
um so why then is charitable trust
involved

01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:11.930 align:start position:0%
involved
um

01:24:11.930 --> 01:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
the issuance of annuities annuities is
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
an insurance product and
 
01:24:19.689 --> 01:24:19.699 align:start position:0%
um generally
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be selling an
 
01:24:22.729 --> 01:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
insurance product you have to be
 
01:24:25.250 --> 01:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
licensed by the insurance department
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
and so if you are I don't know Dartmouth
 
01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
College or something you don't want to
 
01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
have to deal with the insurance
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
department so uh bill got passed years
 
01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
ago to say that
 
01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
um non-profits that issue charitable
 
01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
gift annuities don't have to get
 
01:24:46.610 --> 01:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
licensed as an insurance company so long
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
as they comply with certain obligations
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
that they have 300 000 in reserve they
 
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
follow certain annuity principles Etc
 
01:24:59.209 --> 01:24:59.219 align:start position:0%
and then every year they have to certify
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
that their annuity program continues to
 
01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
abide by those requirements
 
01:25:08.689 --> 01:25:08.699 align:start position:0%
and so long as they do that
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
um then they're free to issue charitable
 
01:25:12.050 --> 01:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
gift annuities and they don't have to
 
01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
get licensed by the insurance department
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
so the filing comes both to us and to
 
01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
um the insurance department and we get a
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
number of these every year where there's
 
01:25:27.370 --> 01:25:27.380 align:start position:0%
just a checklist of five or so items
 
01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
that that this charity is complying with
 
01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
this requirements with respect to its
 
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
charitable gift annuity program
 
01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
and that's all set forth in RSA uh
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
chapter 403 e
 
01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
this bill would amend 403e to expand the
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity for certain group of
 
01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
Charities to offer charitable gift
 
01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.890 align:start position:0%
Charities to offer charitable gift
annuities

01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
annuities
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
and as I said we're not taking position
 
01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:57.649 align:start position:0%
and as I said we're not taking position
on

01:25:57.649 --> 01:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
on that uh there is one this paragraph
 
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
two that I've uh raises concerns and so
 
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
now I'm gonna for a minute
 
01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
leave the world of charitable gift
 
01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
annuities and and bore you with
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
um another
 
01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
type of of charitable donation
 
01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:20.390 align:start position:0%
type of of charitable donation
so

01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:21.590 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
you have the opportunity any individual
 
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
has an opportunity to um
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
to set up a Donor advised fund there are
 
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
companies like Fidelity Schwab
 
01:26:36.649 --> 01:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
uh even the New Hampshire charitable
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
Foundation offer Donor advised funds
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
what that is is like a savings account
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
for you
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
um to put a a pot of money away you get
 
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
your charitable tax deduction up front
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
and let's say you donate ten thousand
 
01:26:57.890 --> 01:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
dollars to Fidelity charitable
 
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
um you then can call them up uh this
 
01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
year next year 10 years from now and say
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
I'd like 10 000 of that if I if I give
 
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
it let's say I don't know a hundred
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
thousand I'll give 10 000 to the Opera
 
01:27:12.649 --> 01:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
uh and then in a couple of years maybe
 
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'll give 10 000 to the hospital you
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
call them up and you can give them
 
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
advice on it and then you can give it
 
01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
away now you you got the tax deduction
 
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
in year one which is good it's no longer
 
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
your money
 
01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
you have an account at Fidelity
 
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
charitable or Schwab charitable or the
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
charitable Foundation
 
01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
and you give them advice and for the
 
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
most part they'll follow your advice as
 
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
long as it's a 501c3 that you recommend
 
01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:41.699 align:start position:0%
the money go to
 
01:27:45.129 --> 01:27:45.139 align:start position:0%
so that's what a Donor advised fund is
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
the uh the sponsors of those donor
 
01:27:53.930 --> 01:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
advice funds are themselves charities
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
um so Fidelity charitable is a 501c3
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
Schwab charitable is a 501c3 the New
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire charitable Foundation is also
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
so you can do that and
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
um it's a convenient way as I say it's
 
01:28:11.149 --> 01:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
almost like a savings account you have
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
but it can only be used for for
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
Charities that that you choose
 
01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:17.689 align:start position:0%
Charities that that you choose
now

01:28:17.689 --> 01:28:17.699 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:28:17.699 --> 01:28:19.689 align:start position:0%
now
some

01:28:19.689 --> 01:28:19.699 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
non-profits also choose to open Donor
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
advised funds and that's what uh Mr
 
01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
Matthew was talking about
 
01:28:32.209 --> 01:28:32.219 align:start position:0%
so if you are um friends of Central High
 
01:28:32.219 --> 01:28:34.010 align:start position:0%
so if you are um friends of Central High
hockey

01:28:34.010 --> 01:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
hockey
 
01:28:36.410 --> 01:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
and you're trying to raise money but you
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
don't feel that
 
01:28:41.629 --> 01:28:41.639 align:start position:0%
um you could invest it well or
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
um uh you just want it to be safe you
 
01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
might say that our endowment is is not
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
going to be held by us but we're friends
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
of of Central High hockey is going to
 
01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
open up a Donor advised fund let's say
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire charitable
 
01:29:01.129 --> 01:29:01.139 align:start position:0%
Foundation or or Fidelity charitable
 
01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
the friends group when they want the
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
money for their own activities can say
 
01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
we we'd like to use this money for our
 
01:29:12.890 --> 01:29:12.900 align:start position:0%
own programming and infidelity
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
charitable will cut a check back to the
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
charity that's how it works so it's like
 
01:29:23.229 --> 01:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:27.300 align:start position:0%
what paragraph two I think is intended
 
01:29:31.010 --> 01:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
to do is to allow these small
 
01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:32.510 align:start position:0%
to do is to allow these small
non-profits

01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
non-profits
 
01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:36.780 align:start position:0%
that use a Donor advised fund for their
 
01:29:38.169 --> 01:29:38.179 align:start position:0%
own endowment
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
like the St Catharines Foundation or
 
01:29:43.070 --> 01:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
friends of Central Hockey
 
01:29:47.570 --> 01:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
to offer this charitable gift annuities
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
the concern I have is not with them the
 
01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:54.900 align:start position:0%
concern I have is that you got the Tom
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
Donovan Donor advised fund at Fidelity
 
01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.169 align:start position:0%
Donovan Donor advised fund at Fidelity
charitable

01:30:00.169 --> 01:30:00.179 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
am I going to go out and and try to sell
 
01:30:06.110 --> 01:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
charitable gift annuities or offer get
 
01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
people to buy them I'm not sure who
 
01:30:12.169 --> 01:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
would but uh if somebody I'd say you
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
know I'm I'm part of fidelity charitable
 
01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
which is a 501c3 uh I can issue a
 
01:30:20.570 --> 01:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
charitable gift annuity
 
01:30:24.290 --> 01:30:24.300 align:start position:0%
um and um the benefit of it will come
 
01:30:27.070 --> 01:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
back to benefit the Tom Donovan
 
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
Donor advised fund I'm not sure that's
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
the intent
 
01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
um and I have might have some concerns
 
01:30:36.410 --> 01:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:30:39.229 --> 01:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
so I don't have a concern if
 
01:30:42.290 --> 01:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
if the if it's a charity that holds the
 
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
Donor advised fund I have a concern if
 
01:30:46.729 --> 01:30:46.739 align:start position:0%
it's an individual that holds a Donor
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
advised fund so that's probably more
 
01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:51.719 align:start position:0%
than you wanted to hear I think that
 
01:30:53.570 --> 01:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
there are probably ways that that this
 
01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
could be worked out in in language but
 
01:30:58.970 --> 01:30:58.980 align:start position:0%
but that's the issue and by the way the
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
term should be Donor advised Fund in the
 
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
bill it should not be Donor advised
 
01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
Foundation that it's a term of art Donor
 
01:31:09.229 --> 01:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
advised fund
 
01:31:12.110 --> 01:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
great thank you Tom uh representative
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
Herbert has a question but
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
you did say you were pretty confused
 
01:31:21.050 --> 01:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
about all this right Chris
 
01:31:23.930 --> 01:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
yes but I mean I I've I've actually sold
 
01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars
 
01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
insurance policy so I'm not as confused
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
maybe as I make out but um
 
01:31:36.410 --> 01:31:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh Tom
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
the last part of your uh
 
01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:42.300 align:start position:0%
uh conditionality or whatever that your
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
observation is that you don't want
 
01:31:49.010 --> 01:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
I mean I understand this is all a huge
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
the funding for this stuff actually
 
01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
comes out of the tax base
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
because you don't have to pay taxes once
 
01:31:58.250 --> 01:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
you give it out to the charitable by
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
definition you're in a non-profit
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
situation and that money can compound
 
01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
however it does without taxes being paid
 
01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
so that's the whole idea of charitable
 
01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
trusts all that stuff and I'm not
 
01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
against that but the but the uh the
 
01:32:18.050 --> 01:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
security part of it is where I get
 
01:32:22.010 --> 01:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
nervous because all of this Finance ends
 
01:32:24.410 --> 01:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
up in a bank somewhere
 
01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it is in debt and if you
 
01:32:29.450 --> 01:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
run into a situation like we're in now
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
where there's uh the most secure
 
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
Financial paper is a treasury and it
 
01:32:38.330 --> 01:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
pays nothing or virtually nothing
 
01:32:41.629 --> 01:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
so it's becoming more and more difficult
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
for these chairs pensions charitables
 
01:32:48.050 --> 01:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
all these guys to uh put enough money
 
01:32:50.450 --> 01:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
aside in order to pay out what they
 
01:32:52.729 --> 01:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
promised in the beginning so I have I
 
01:32:56.689 --> 01:32:56.699 align:start position:0%
have that concern that it's it's generic
 
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
but the last part you talked about was
 
01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
you want to make sure that somebody's
 
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
not going around
 
01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
using this vehicle just to sell
 
01:33:10.250 --> 01:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh annuities
 
01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:11.330 align:start position:0%
uh annuities
because

01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
that's where the security is coming from
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
is is an insurance company somewhere and
 
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
then and and behind the insurance
 
01:33:21.169 --> 01:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
company are banks so this is all tied
 
01:33:21.179 --> 01:33:22.070 align:start position:0%
company are banks so this is all tied
together

01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:33:24.649 --> 01:33:24.659 align:start position:0%
and I have one more I have one question
 
01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know if you know it the
 
01:33:29.629 --> 01:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
answer to this time and that is how many
 
01:33:29.639 --> 01:33:30.550 align:start position:0%
answer to this time and that is how many
uh

01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:32.450 align:start position:0%
uh
non-profit

01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
non-profit
 
01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
organizations are there in the state of
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:33:40.610 --> 01:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
uh so representative Herbert there are
 
01:33:43.850 --> 01:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
so we have registered with us 11
 
01:33:46.729 --> 01:33:46.739 align:start position:0%
000 charitable organizations uh roughly
 
01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
6 000 of them are based here in New
 
01:33:51.410 --> 01:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I think your question is
 
01:33:52.970 --> 01:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
there so there are six thousand of us
 
01:33:55.010 --> 01:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
here and that's everything from your
 
01:33:57.410 --> 01:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
local Little League all the way up to
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
your hospitals and Dartmouth College and
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
everything in between okay so so my
 
01:34:05.689 --> 01:34:05.699 align:start position:0%
concern with the generic cons another
 
01:34:05.699 --> 01:34:07.669 align:start position:0%
concern with the generic cons another
question

01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
do you have any cons where are your
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
concerns in terms of risk
 
01:34:15.649 --> 01:34:15.659 align:start position:0%
and and your last comment is that was
 
01:34:18.770 --> 01:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
that a risk variable when you were
 
01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
talking about who's selling it and who's
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
owning it uh no uh my concern is is that
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
I want
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
um people who are giving to a charity to
 
01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:29.990 align:start position:0%
um people who are giving to a charity to
be

01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:34:32.689 --> 01:34:32.699 align:start position:0%
um that that the the charitable portion
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
of it get used for charitable purposes
 
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's my concern the insurance
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
department would be concerned that the
 
01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
buyer of the annuity gets paid
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
um and and so your other questions about
 
01:34:48.410 --> 01:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
risk representative Herbert would be
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
best answered by the insurance
 
01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:54.229 align:start position:0%
best answered by the insurance
department

01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:58.370 --> 01:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:59.930 --> 01:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
um thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
question Tom I'm going to ask you the
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
same question that I I asked the
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative previously and actually
 
01:35:07.850 --> 01:35:07.860 align:start position:0%
it's a two-prong question one do you
 
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
have concerns about the fact that under
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
this a charity could be in business for
 
01:35:15.010 --> 01:35:15.020 align:start position:0%
just over a year and secondly do you see
 
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
how often do you see uh young Charities
 
01:35:20.209 --> 01:35:20.219 align:start position:0%
let's put it uh um go out of business
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
after a short period of time in New
 
01:35:22.199 --> 01:35:23.270 align:start position:0%
after a short period of time in New
Hampshire

01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that uh representative Burroughs
 
01:35:27.169 --> 01:35:27.179 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting question
 
01:35:27.179 --> 01:35:27.950 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting question
um

01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
I don't have any specific numbers to
 
01:35:32.689 --> 01:35:32.699 align:start position:0%
give you obviously
 
01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
um newer Charities are more likely to
 
01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:36.290 align:start position:0%
um newer Charities are more likely to
fail

01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
fail
 
01:35:38.689 --> 01:35:38.699 align:start position:0%
uh than more established Charities but
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh we get a long time Charities that
 
01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
that fail as well I it it a lot of it
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
just often it depends on the strength of
 
01:35:48.649 --> 01:35:48.659 align:start position:0%
the board
 
01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
do you have a problem with that one year
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
number do you think that should be
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
higher yeah I'm not going to comment on
 
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:08.689 --> 01:36:08.699 align:start position:0%
uh representative Herbert do you have a
 
01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:15.070 --> 01:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
yeah okay let me put your hand down
 
01:36:17.149 --> 01:36:17.159 align:start position:0%
you're muted crisp and I'm going to take
 
01:36:18.649 --> 01:36:18.659 align:start position:0%
put your hand down okay you did okay
 
01:36:18.659 --> 01:36:19.870 align:start position:0%
put your hand down okay you did okay
okay

01:36:19.870 --> 01:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:25.729 --> 01:36:25.739 align:start position:0%
for attorney Donovan seeing none we
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Tom and I see that
 
01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:29.990 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Tom and I see that
uh

01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
Steve would like to come and offer up
 
01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:34.679 align:start position:0%
the Last Words which he has time to do
 
01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to bring him back in
 
01:36:39.169 --> 01:36:39.179 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
um here here what he has to say
 
01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
so to wrap it up Steve you got
 
01:36:48.410 --> 01:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:54.239 --> 01:36:56.030 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry uh Tom Donovan did an
 
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
excellent job in raising a really good
 
01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:01.669 align:start position:0%
excellent job in raising a really good
issue

01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh which is about small individuals who
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
set up their own and then all of a
 
01:37:08.930 --> 01:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
sudden they're out selling charitable
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
gift annuities I just want to reiterate
 
01:37:14.450 --> 01:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
the fact that even if they did the money
 
01:37:17.689 --> 01:37:17.699 align:start position:0%
goes immediately to the large charitable
 
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
organization who is who is backing their
 
01:37:23.930 --> 01:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
Donor advised fund so if it was a
 
01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
Fidelity charitable if it was the
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
American endowment Foundation it was a
 
01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
Renaissance Foundation whatever it is
 
01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
that donor advice fund money goes
 
01:37:35.570 --> 01:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
immediately to that organization that's
 
01:37:39.169 --> 01:37:39.179 align:start position:0%
item number one number two uh all of the
 
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
distributions or grants that come out of
 
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
that donor advice fund must go to a
 
01:37:47.090 --> 01:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
qualified 501c3
 
01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
so that after the individual raises
 
01:37:53.209 --> 01:37:53.219 align:start position:0%
money for his or her foundation they on
 
01:37:55.490 --> 01:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
a personal level have no access to that
 
01:37:58.370 --> 01:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
money ever again and when you set up a
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
donor advice Foundation you also cannot
 
01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
benefit from that personally in other
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
words you can't be an insurance agent
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
selling it to yourself or setting up a
 
01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
commercial annuity for yourself you
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
can't be in any way benefiting as
 
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
registered investment advisor on the
 
01:38:17.689 --> 01:38:17.699 align:start position:0%
account uh I mean than just speaking as
 
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
a registered investment advisor my wife
 
01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
and I have an account uh our own donor
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
advise Foundation set up at Fidelity
 
01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
charitable uh we get nothing off of that
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
other than the fact that we're making
 
01:38:32.930 --> 01:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
charitable donations each year and then
 
01:38:34.970 --> 01:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
we you know we actually aggregate our
 
01:38:36.770 --> 01:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
charitable contributions we might give
 
01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:37.970 align:start position:0%
charitable contributions we might give
25

01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:38:39.649 --> 01:38:39.659 align:start position:0%
000 in one year to take full advantage
 
01:38:41.930 --> 01:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
of our our tax deductions and the next
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
year women might not give anything to
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
that foundation and then ultimately in
 
01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
any distributions we make to our
 
01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
charitable to our church or whatever
 
01:38:52.729 --> 01:38:52.739 align:start position:0%
come out of our foundation it doesn't
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
matter to us we never have access to
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
those funds again so while I understand
 
01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:00.430 align:start position:0%
those funds again so while I understand
uh

01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:03.169 --> 01:39:03.179 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire attorney general Donovan's
 
01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh position
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that it really matters
 
01:39:09.890 --> 01:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
because again there's no personal
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
benefit other than the fact that the
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
Steve Matthew foundation of the Tom
 
01:39:17.149 --> 01:39:17.159 align:start position:0%
Donovan Foundation is now making a gift
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
to the Opera New Hampshire or to the
 
01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
Palace Theater or to whatever so I don't
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
think that's an issue so
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
at this point I'll shut up and if any of
 
01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
you so I guess my question see it's
 
01:39:32.450 --> 01:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
assuming that this uh concept right I
 
01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
mean I certainly am familiar with this
 
01:39:34.199 --> 01:39:35.450 align:start position:0%
mean I certainly am familiar with this
product

01:39:35.450 --> 01:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:37.010 align:start position:0%
product
um

01:39:37.010 --> 01:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:39.530 --> 01:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
assuming that this is around another for
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
small ones I mean because I the ones I
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
know are all big parody so but for so
 
01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
this idea of having small Charities put
 
01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
this uh create this I assume this is not
 
01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know other states have done this so
 
01:39:52.729 --> 01:39:52.739 align:start position:0%
have other states put in some kind of
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
safeguards or some kind of bumpers to
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
ensure that this this is not abused yeah
 
01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
I I've reviewed the legislation of of 12
 
01:40:04.490 --> 01:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
different states and and basically it's
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's almost word for word what came
 
01:40:08.330 --> 01:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
out of those other states
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
so there are right now 48 out of the 50
 
01:40:15.169 --> 01:40:15.179 align:start position:0%
states that offer this type of ability
 
01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
for commercial insurance with regard to
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
the specifics of the Donor advised funds
 
01:40:24.649 --> 01:40:24.659 align:start position:0%
uh being included in that I I truthfully
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
don't know because I haven't looked to
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
see whether any of them included it I
 
01:40:31.129 --> 01:40:31.139 align:start position:0%
just put it into hours as an
 
01:40:33.530 --> 01:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
afterthought because of the fact that uh
 
01:40:35.930 --> 01:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
these are there are a lot of them and
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
some of the ones we work with that have
 
01:40:40.370 --> 01:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
established these things and I see this
 
01:40:43.129 --> 01:40:43.139 align:start position:0%
as a way to help them grow into larger
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
things I know right now we've grown the
 
01:40:47.450 --> 01:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
Saint Catherine school from zero up to
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's probably somewhere around 180 190
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
000 right now uh the saint Marie's uh
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
three years ago Saint Marie's church we
 
01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
were only at uh somewhere down around
 
01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:58.729 align:start position:0%
were only at uh somewhere down around
240

01:40:58.729 --> 01:40:58.739 align:start position:0%
240
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
000 we're up over half a million now so
 
01:41:03.229 --> 01:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
they could issue one on their own if
 
01:41:06.649 --> 01:41:06.659 align:start position:0%
they wanted to but still they're not
 
01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
interested in hiring the actuary real
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
support they're not interested in the uh
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
the maintenance of these things and the
 
01:41:15.890 --> 01:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
risk that's associated of having people
 
01:41:17.450 --> 01:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
on their board who can manage those
 
01:41:18.890 --> 01:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
funds for them and do what has to be
 
01:41:20.570 --> 01:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
done so
 
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
um but but
 
01:41:23.930 --> 01:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of where I'm coming
 
01:41:26.450 --> 01:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
at it I think perfect sense you know
 
01:41:27.709 --> 01:41:27.719 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to do is makes
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
perfect sense but
 
01:41:31.129 --> 01:41:31.139 align:start position:0%
um how about the one year did all the
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
other states who have have the the
 
01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:35.699 align:start position:0%
non-profits existed for one year
 
01:41:38.209 --> 01:41:38.219 align:start position:0%
uh I there are some that are one year
 
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
there are some that are five years there
 
01:41:41.330 --> 01:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
are some that are three years it's all
 
01:41:42.649 --> 01:41:42.659 align:start position:0%
over the place
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
01:41:47.450 --> 01:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
so I throw out one year but you know if
 
01:41:49.729 --> 01:41:49.739 align:start position:0%
you were to go three years I'm okay with
 
01:41:52.250 --> 01:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
that doesn't matter to me I don't think
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's necessary to go five years the key
 
01:41:56.750 --> 01:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
is whether there's an ongoing intent I
 
01:41:59.330 --> 01:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
know like for example with the the small
 
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
ones that I work with uh friends of
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
Central Hockey we're we're interested in
 
01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
building that up long term to continue
 
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
to support that organization years into
 
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
the future and if Central should cease
 
01:42:11.810 --> 01:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
to exist there's a there's an intent
 
01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
there where that would be immediately
 
01:42:16.250 --> 01:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
transferred to another high school
 
01:42:18.169 --> 01:42:18.179 align:start position:0%
hockey program somewhere depending on
 
01:42:20.689 --> 01:42:20.699 align:start position:0%
what the successors are uh and the same
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
thing holds true if the diocese should
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
close down St Catherine's school or or
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
Saint Joseph Junior High School same
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
thing we've got a succession plan in
 
01:42:31.609 --> 01:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
place under that Foundation where those
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
assets could be transferred to a
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
comparable organization
 
01:42:38.689 --> 01:42:38.699 align:start position:0%
right well I certainly that's obviously
 
01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
a terrible trust major major mission is
 
01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
to take care of those who who wind down
 
01:42:44.689 --> 01:42:44.699 align:start position:0%
and make sure the monies are are
 
01:42:46.609 --> 01:42:46.619 align:start position:0%
appropriately uh yeah just to an
 
01:42:48.890 --> 01:42:48.900 align:start position:0%
appropriate charity that's right but I
 
01:42:51.169 --> 01:42:51.179 align:start position:0%
would have to say that most of the
 
01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:53.219 align:start position:0%
orientations that I know that do this
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
um are large ones and I think a lot of
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
schools I mean I think the first one I
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
knew about was Deerfield Academy and you
 
01:43:01.070 --> 01:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
know they have a huge endowment and and
 
01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh so it's usually very large ones who
 
01:43:06.169 --> 01:43:06.179 align:start position:0%
have uh the whole fundraising Department
 
01:43:08.450 --> 01:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
who's you know people who are that's all
 
01:43:10.370 --> 01:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
they do is go knock on doors and try to
 
01:43:13.310 --> 01:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
raise money so uh it's the idea of the
 
01:43:15.410 --> 01:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
little ones a little scary
 
01:43:16.850 --> 01:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
um however having said that I am
 
01:43:18.169 --> 01:43:18.179 align:start position:0%
treasurer of the wrench historical
 
01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
society and we did uh receive a half a
 
01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:23.340 align:start position:0%
million dollar Grant I mean you know
 
01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
someone in their estate in which
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
immediately I you know I put that off to
 
01:43:29.090 --> 01:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
having having
 
01:43:32.450 --> 01:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
um an appropriate Financial uh entity to
 
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
manage that uh and manage that fund so
 
01:43:38.209 --> 01:43:38.219 align:start position:0%
uh but the same time it's um it's a
 
01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
little this the idea is it's a little
 
01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
scary and you want to make sure that
 
01:43:45.290 --> 01:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's a Rich Man sport you
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
know it's only it's all for people
 
01:43:49.129 --> 01:43:49.139 align:start position:0%
who've got who need who've got so much
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
income that they they can afford to put
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
cash away and and get the tax deduction
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
um so so but at the same time we want to
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that we uh make sure that that
 
01:44:03.770 --> 01:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
nobody gets tempted to to abuse this
 
01:44:05.629 --> 01:44:05.639 align:start position:0%
well I think by and large you're correct
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
I mean the the vast majority of the
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
people that are purchasing the
 
01:44:11.090 --> 01:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
charitable gift annuities are people of
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
means and most of them are in the at
 
01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
least a 22 federal income tax bracket
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
and they're they're paying the New
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire interest and dividends tax so
 
01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
I I think you're correct uh to address
 
01:44:24.890 --> 01:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
uh uh representative Herbert's point
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
from a tax standpoint uh the uh this
 
01:44:30.770 --> 01:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
actually by by building up a lot of
 
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
these charitable organizations you take
 
01:44:34.010 --> 01:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of pressure off a lot of local
 
01:44:36.410 --> 01:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
communities and governments because uh
 
01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:38.699 align:start position:0%
if you look at who delivers uh Justin
 
01:44:41.090 --> 01:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
just in Manchester for example you know
 
01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
you've got Catholic Charities uh
 
01:44:45.290 --> 01:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
delivering you know billions of dollars
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
of services every single year that
 
01:44:49.010 --> 01:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
otherwise would probably have to be
 
01:44:50.810 --> 01:44:50.820 align:start position:0%
supported by government to some extent
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
so I you know I think there's you know
 
01:44:54.890 --> 01:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
it's a double-edged sword yeah yeah
 
01:44:57.050 --> 01:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
there might be an initial year loss but
 
01:44:58.970 --> 01:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
in future years if people are building
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
up these endowments and these
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
organizations it certainly is to the
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
benefit of the communities that they
 
01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:05.570 align:start position:0%
benefit of the communities that they
serve

01:45:05.570 --> 01:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
serve
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
fair enough okay everybody all set any
 
01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
more questions seeing seeing none uh we
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and we will close the
 
01:45:19.330 --> 01:45:19.340 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
and uh well not a lot of people signed
 
01:45:24.530 --> 01:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
up on this one that we have one person
 
01:45:26.930 --> 01:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
supports no not a pose and one was
 
01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:27.890 align:start position:0%
supports no not a pose and one was
neutral

01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh with that I will close the public
 
01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:30.970 align:start position:0%
uh with that I will close the public
hearing

01:45:30.970 --> 01:45:30.980 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
and we're right right on time for our
 
01:45:36.649 --> 01:45:36.659 align:start position:0%
next one I think
 
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
all right okay
 
01:45:41.209 --> 01:45:41.219 align:start position:0%
all right relative to motor vehicle
 
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:47.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:45:47.470 --> 01:45:47.480 align:start position:0%

Hillsboro 13 which is Ward 6 in
 
01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:06.649 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 13 which is Ward 6 in
Manchester

01:46:06.649 --> 01:46:06.659 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
um I am submitting this bill on behalf
 
01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire insurance agent
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
Association where I served as a board
 
01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
member the president uh at one point I
 
01:46:17.090 --> 01:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
am now on our national board so
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I do too many things for
 
01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
uh for no money
 
01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:23.820 align:start position:0%
um but that's okay I like that I don't
 
01:46:25.970 --> 01:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
mind volunteering put this under no good
 
01:46:28.250 --> 01:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
deed goes unpunished 32 years ago when I
 
01:46:31.129 --> 01:46:31.139 align:start position:0%
received my insurance license the
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
insurance uh limits minimum insurance
 
01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:35.639 align:start position:0%
limits are the same as they are today
 
01:46:37.729 --> 01:46:37.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is one of only two states
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
that doesn't require mandatory auto
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
insurance and I'm okay with that because
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
the numbers bear out and I don't want to
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
get into a discussion about that but I
 
01:46:47.689 --> 01:46:47.699 align:start position:0%
must say for a state that doesn't have
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
insurance requirements auto insurance
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
requirements we have more people have it
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
than in other parts of New England that
 
01:46:56.090 --> 01:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
it's all mandatory because we have some
 
01:46:58.010 --> 01:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
they called underinsured and under
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
uninsured and underinsured motorists so
 
01:47:01.370 --> 01:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
if you get hit by someone like I did by
 
01:47:04.129 --> 01:47:04.139 align:start position:0%
a drunk driver at 11 o'clock one morning
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
um who didn't have insurance my
 
01:47:07.850 --> 01:47:07.860 align:start position:0%
insurance took care of it I got to
 
01:47:09.649 --> 01:47:09.659 align:start position:0%
manage it and my car was taken care of
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
and it didn't cost me anything uh it
 
01:47:14.450 --> 01:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
cost my insurance company didn't cost me
 
01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:15.649 align:start position:0%
cost my insurance company didn't cost me
anything

01:47:15.649 --> 01:47:15.659 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
and uh it didn't affect my record but as
 
01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
a result of only having uh being one of
 
01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
the only two states that no longer
 
01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
requires auto insurance
 
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
um you we do two things if you get into
 
01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
a auto accident where you caused damage
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
or liability to some in private
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
individual and you do not have insurance
 
01:47:38.229 --> 01:47:38.239 align:start position:0%
coverage the insurance department says
 
01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
You must get insurance before you get
 
01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
your license back you must have it
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
because you've already caused an
 
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
incident so you have to have it many of
 
01:47:49.490 --> 01:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
you have heard about it with uh DWI is
 
01:47:50.530 --> 01:47:50.540 align:start position:0%
there anything called they called an
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
SR22 form where you have to have this
 
01:47:56.570 --> 01:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
coverage we also tell people who get
 
01:47:58.850 --> 01:47:58.860 align:start position:0%
their first car and they Auto and they
 
01:48:00.649 --> 01:48:00.659 align:start position:0%
say Hey you know I'm gonna get my first
 
01:48:03.649 --> 01:48:03.659 align:start position:0%
car I want to get insurance I want the
 
01:48:06.410 --> 01:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
minimum Allowed by New Hampshire law
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
that's what we have right now these
 
01:48:10.370 --> 01:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
minimums are you know as outlined in the
 
01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:11.570 align:start position:0%
minimums are you know as outlined in the
bill

01:48:11.570 --> 01:48:11.580 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:48:13.370 --> 01:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
um they're very low
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
um and my opinion is we are giving a
 
01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
false sense of security to someone to be
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
able to say look we need you to get this
 
01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
mandatory Insurance because you're
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
forced to because you didn't have
 
01:48:25.850 --> 01:48:25.860 align:start position:0%
because you had an uninsured claim
 
01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:26.689 align:start position:0%
because you had an uninsured claim
before

01:48:26.689 --> 01:48:26.699 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
or whether you're just starting out and
 
01:48:30.410 --> 01:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
you just want to or you want to get
 
01:48:31.729 --> 01:48:31.739 align:start position:0%
insurance and you're buying the minimum
 
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that's enough the 25
 
01:48:36.290 --> 01:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
000 in in
 
01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:37.609 align:start position:0%
000 in in
um

01:48:37.609 --> 01:48:37.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:39.770 --> 01:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
coverage for property damage I don't
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
think every single one of you have
 
01:48:42.290 --> 01:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
probably has a vehicle worth more than
 
01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollars you might
 
01:48:45.470 --> 01:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
be a little irked if someone hits you
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
when they have the bare minimum
 
01:48:50.330 --> 01:48:50.340 align:start position:0%
now in Maine
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
um has a much higher limit the same
 
01:48:55.550 --> 01:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
limit that I am proposing now I this
 
01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
goes under as I said no good deed goes
 
01:48:58.970 --> 01:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
unpunished I didn't mean to cause a
 
01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
Ruckus I just think that after 32 years
 
01:49:05.090 --> 01:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
we should probably have insurance limits
 
01:49:06.830 --> 01:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
up to where they should be
 
01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:10.689 align:start position:0%
up to where they should be
uh

01:49:10.689 --> 01:49:10.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:16.129 --> 01:49:16.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:20.930 --> 01:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:25.609 --> 01:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
I can't hear him but I see him
 
01:49:29.450 --> 01:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
well you could well I only see the
 
01:49:31.490 --> 01:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
square I don't actually yeah I don't see
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
his face no back into his face
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I can't hear him so how do I
 
01:49:40.669 --> 01:49:40.679 align:start position:0%
make sure he knows we can't hear him I
 
01:49:42.770 --> 01:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
can hear you fine oh there he is okay
 
01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
there you are
 
01:49:46.129 --> 01:49:46.139 align:start position:0%
I I don't know where I lost you Mr
 
01:49:47.590 --> 01:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is I just think there
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
should be enough coverage when we're
 
01:49:52.490 --> 01:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
mandating people either have insurance
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
or we're offering them saying this is
 
01:49:56.450 --> 01:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
the bare minimum it should at least be
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
able to cover
 
01:50:01.850 --> 01:50:01.860 align:start position:0%
um what a normal car accident uh would
 
01:50:04.669 --> 01:50:04.679 align:start position:0%
would entail the cost to increase this
 
01:50:08.209 --> 01:50:08.219 align:start position:0%
is about 15 to 20 dollars a year
 
01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
in the estimates that my office has done
 
01:50:13.370 --> 01:50:13.380 align:start position:0%
for me so we're not talking huge amounts
 
01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:14.149 align:start position:0%
for me so we're not talking huge amounts
um

01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
but I I don't want to cause a big Ruckus
 
01:50:19.129 --> 01:50:19.139 align:start position:0%
the insurance agents feel that it should
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
be higher uh if someone comes to my
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
office Mr chairman and says this is what
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
I want for coverage
 
01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
um I want the bare minimum I have no
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
choice but to sell it to them by law I
 
01:50:31.790 --> 01:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
cannot say no
 
01:50:34.370 --> 01:50:34.380 align:start position:0%
now I do have them sign a waiver saying
 
01:50:36.169 --> 01:50:36.179 align:start position:0%
I don't think this is appropriate we
 
01:50:37.970 --> 01:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
want you to buy at least 100 000 for
 
01:50:39.169 --> 01:50:39.179 align:start position:0%
occurrence three hundred thousand
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
aggregate because we feel that's
 
01:50:42.109 --> 01:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate because we don't want to get
 
01:50:43.310 --> 01:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
sued and we don't think that's
 
01:50:45.229 --> 01:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
sufficient but
 
01:50:47.930 --> 01:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
again if people people have a problem
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
with this I'm not going to rush my
 
01:50:51.050 --> 01:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
Laurels onto the Insurance Agents
 
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
Association wanted to make their point
 
01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
that we think it's too low and and we
 
01:50:57.290 --> 01:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
get complaints a lot of times about
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
people saying they someone didn't have
 
01:50:59.870 --> 01:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
enough coverage why doesn't the
 
01:51:01.970 --> 01:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
legislature do something about it well
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to do something about
 
01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:04.609 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to do something about
it

01:51:04.609 --> 01:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:51:07.729 --> 01:51:07.739 align:start position:0%
um and we think that uh Alaska and Maine
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
on both ends of the country have decided
 
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
that uh I'm right and they've increased
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
theirs many of the other states do not
 
01:51:16.609 --> 01:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
have limits that I have proposed but
 
01:51:18.530 --> 01:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
then again they all have mandatory
 
01:51:20.209 --> 01:51:20.219 align:start position:0%
Insurance we're one of the few that
 
01:51:20.219 --> 01:51:21.350 align:start position:0%
Insurance we're one of the few that
don't

01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh happy to take any questions Mr
 
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
chairman okay yeah before I go I just
 
01:51:26.810 --> 01:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I uh correct something
 
01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:28.850 align:start position:0%
to understand
um

01:51:28.850 --> 01:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
if you were to get into an accident with
 
01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
someone who the other person said fault
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
and they are uh at the current level you
 
01:51:40.609 --> 01:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
know the uh would you consider under uh
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
under insured
 
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
so even if the claim you're making is
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
going to be greater than what they are
 
01:51:50.810 --> 01:51:50.820 align:start position:0%
covering then your policy kicks in for
 
01:51:53.570 --> 01:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
the difference and it would be can still
 
01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
treat it as a uninsured because it's
 
01:51:59.390 --> 01:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
they're underinsured but it's considered
 
01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
under uh uninsured and so you don't uh
 
01:52:06.649 --> 01:52:06.659 align:start position:0%
your your policy can't be impacted
 
01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
um if if that has to kick in that over
 
01:52:11.689 --> 01:52:11.699 align:start position:0%
over and above if the other person's
 
01:52:13.609 --> 01:52:13.619 align:start position:0%
policy is not adequate is that correct
 
01:52:16.609 --> 01:52:16.619 align:start position:0%
yes yes and gnome from a liability
 
01:52:19.250 --> 01:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
standpoint yes but if you don't have
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
uninsured motorist for property damage
 
01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
or uninsured then your vehicle may not
 
01:52:26.510 --> 01:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
be covered ability standpoint because
 
01:52:28.010 --> 01:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
you know you have to buy when you buy
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
uninsured and uninsured motorists
 
01:52:31.370 --> 01:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
there's two aspects to that one is a
 
01:52:33.229 --> 01:52:33.239 align:start position:0%
liability and one is a physical damage
 
01:52:35.570 --> 01:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
not everyone buys the physical damage
 
01:52:40.149 --> 01:52:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
because it's a liability issue here but
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh it is true that I I
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
um my old sobs there's someone dating
 
01:52:52.010 --> 01:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
back to 95 and in my 2000 I I don't buy
 
01:52:54.649 --> 01:52:54.659 align:start position:0%
Collision because uh the car's not worth
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
anything right okay we do have questions
 
01:53:00.370 --> 01:53:00.380 align:start position:0%
representative first
 
01:53:04.510 --> 01:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh representative
 
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
infantine I have one question
 
01:53:11.930 --> 01:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
um for you what is the if you know
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
what is the typical level of insurance
 
01:53:19.609 --> 01:53:19.619 align:start position:0%
of the average driver in the state of
 
01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh you're you're going
 
01:53:24.690 --> 01:53:24.700 align:start position:0%
after fifty hundred fifty
 
01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:25.430 align:start position:0%
after fifty hundred fifty
[Music]

01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:26.390 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
if you know what the average is could
 
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
you uh share that with us you know we
 
01:53:32.810 --> 01:53:32.820 align:start position:0%
asked the insurance department when we
 
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
met with them in November and expressed
 
01:53:35.810 --> 01:53:35.820 align:start position:0%
our desire to do this and they were
 
01:53:37.129 --> 01:53:37.139 align:start position:0%
going to try to get us a number but they
 
01:53:39.649 --> 01:53:39.659 align:start position:0%
were not able to figure it out by the
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
information they have so
 
01:53:45.590 --> 01:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
um I would not be able to even Venture a
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
gas representative
 
01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair
 
01:53:59.330 --> 01:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
um you know that this is um a bill that
 
01:54:01.609 --> 01:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
I'm going to strongly support
 
01:54:04.129 --> 01:54:04.139 align:start position:0%
um we've got to get our limits up
 
01:54:06.890 --> 01:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
um for mandatory limits
 
01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:07.490 align:start position:0%
um for mandatory limits
um

01:54:07.490 --> 01:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
you are right oh well anyway that's all
 
01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:17.330 --> 01:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
okay uh uh representative McClure is
 
01:54:17.340 --> 01:54:18.649 align:start position:0%
okay uh uh representative McClure is
next

01:54:18.649 --> 01:54:18.659 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh Mr chair
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
um a question actually my first real job
 
01:54:27.169 --> 01:54:27.179 align:start position:0%
was as an insurance adjuster in Maine
 
01:54:29.390 --> 01:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
and I was absolutely shocked when I got
 
01:54:31.250 --> 01:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
to Maine and found out you didn't have
 
01:54:33.530 --> 01:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
to have auto insurance but I can't
 
01:54:35.149 --> 01:54:35.159 align:start position:0%
remember what
 
01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
how it was settled so for example
 
01:54:39.770 --> 01:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
um I get hit by somebody who doesn't
 
01:54:41.330 --> 01:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
have insurance or doesn't have the
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
limits my uh uninsured voters coverage
 
01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
kicks in uh in New Hampshire does the
 
01:54:51.410 --> 01:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
insurance company subrogate against that
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
individual if or do they just wash their
 
01:54:57.050 --> 01:54:57.060 align:start position:0%
hands and walk away
 
01:54:58.850 --> 01:54:58.860 align:start position:0%
I think they make every attempt to
 
01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
subrogate to be reimbursed for what they
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
had to pay out more often than not
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes these people really don't have
 
01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
any other aspects
 
01:55:08.810 --> 01:55:08.820 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:55:12.410 --> 01:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:15.370 --> 01:55:15.380 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much and thank you
 
01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:17.820 align:start position:0%
representative infantine
 
01:55:21.050 --> 01:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
um my question uh may have been answered
 
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
but I I still want to ask you make sure
 
01:55:26.570 --> 01:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
um when we um we heard a bill uh I
 
01:55:33.590 --> 01:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
believe the last session that was to uh
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
change from allowing people not to have
 
01:55:40.189 --> 01:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
automobile insurance they're requiring
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
um everyone and that did not go forward
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
of course
 
01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
um but we heard a lot of testimony from
 
01:55:50.209 --> 01:55:50.219 align:start position:0%
people who uh had been in situations
 
01:55:52.729 --> 01:55:52.739 align:start position:0%
where their own they didn't have enough
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
Insurance themselves and someone else
 
01:55:58.609 --> 01:55:58.619 align:start position:0%
hit them and so they they couldn't make
 
01:56:02.930 --> 01:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
up the difference damage and so forth
 
01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:04.790 align:start position:0%
up the difference damage and so forth
um

01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:07.490 --> 01:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's my question my question my my
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
question is uh
 
01:56:10.199 --> 01:56:11.689 align:start position:0%
question is uh
um

01:56:11.689 --> 01:56:11.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:15.770 --> 01:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
will the will the will the increase that
 
01:56:21.010 --> 01:56:21.020 align:start position:0%
you Advocate uh in your opinion uh
 
01:56:26.330 --> 01:56:26.340 align:start position:0%
obviate the problem of uh I mean and uh
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps perhaps you could just I know
 
01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
you spoke about it could you just say a
 
01:56:31.970 --> 01:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
couple a little bit more about how you
 
01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
came to those uh those limits
 
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes we kind of emulated what the the
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
ones were
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
um the higher ones which are again we
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
are emulating Maine and Alaska many of
 
01:56:45.950 --> 01:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
the other states are very close to where
 
01:56:47.570 --> 01:56:47.580 align:start position:0%
we are we're about in the middle
 
01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:49.310 align:start position:0%
we are we're about in the middle
currently

01:56:49.310 --> 01:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
um yes there's a lot of frustration when
 
01:56:53.209 --> 01:56:53.219 align:start position:0%
someone has minimum coverage
 
01:56:55.850 --> 01:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
um and it doesn't adopt you hit a one
 
01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
car which hits another one you're
 
01:56:58.970 --> 01:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
responsible for both cars and that
 
01:57:00.590 --> 01:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollars isn't going
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
to to be enough
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:11.330 --> 01:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh you just blurted out again we'll
 
01:57:13.010 --> 01:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
we'll see if you're there in a second
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:22.669 --> 01:57:22.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman representative
 
01:57:24.589 --> 01:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
infantite Mr chairman I have three
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
questions may be recognized for three
 
01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
quick questions rather than to ask you
 
01:57:31.250 --> 01:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh Siri Autumn thank you representative
 
01:57:34.129 --> 01:57:34.139 align:start position:0%
infantime can you tell us uh how many
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
years the current minimums have been in
 
01:57:38.510 --> 01:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
place here in New Hampshire
 
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative other than the 32
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
years I've had my insurance license I
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
don't know how long after that that
 
01:57:46.430 --> 01:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
we've utilized these same limits would
 
01:57:49.609 --> 01:57:49.619 align:start position:0%
you be able to get that to us please yes
 
01:57:52.250 --> 01:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you number two um I'm wondering um
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
you have made reference to the other 49
 
01:57:58.970 --> 01:57:58.980 align:start position:0%
states and New Hampshire being somewhere
 
01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
in the middle
 
01:58:02.450 --> 01:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
can you be more specific than that and
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
also uh part 2B uh what's the rationale
 
01:58:10.510 --> 01:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
for emulating Maine and Alaska
 
01:58:13.370 --> 01:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
rather than any other states and why
 
01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:15.609 align:start position:0%
rather than any other states and why
emulate

01:58:15.609 --> 01:58:15.619 align:start position:0%
emulate
 
01:58:19.370 --> 01:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
I will send you a list of the entire uh
 
01:58:21.530 --> 01:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
country every all the minimum limits for
 
01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
everyone I have a nice little chart here
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
so everyone can see where we are most of
 
01:58:29.450 --> 01:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
them are 25 50 25 where we are
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
um uh why mean in Alaska we were looking
 
01:58:34.490 --> 01:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to be more than anyone
 
01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:36.830 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to be more than anyone
else

01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:38.930 --> 01:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
so that was one of the rationale and it
 
01:58:40.490 --> 01:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
was just simply to double what we had
 
01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:42.050 align:start position:0%
was just simply to double what we had
which

01:58:42.050 --> 01:58:42.060 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:58:44.629 --> 01:58:44.639 align:start position:0%
um just happened to be Alaska and Maine
 
01:58:46.970 --> 01:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
and number three would you restate once
 
01:58:49.149 --> 01:58:49.159 align:start position:0%
again uh please
 
01:58:52.129 --> 01:58:52.139 align:start position:0%
the uh rather I think you said rather
 
01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
minimal amount and you may have even
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
Quantified this in terms of an estimate
 
01:59:00.350 --> 01:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh a minimal amount in uh premium
 
01:59:02.810 --> 01:59:02.820 align:start position:0%
increase to double the limits
 
01:59:04.970 --> 01:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
yes this quote these were quotes for for
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
me so I'm a 57 year old male so it's not
 
01:59:08.330 --> 01:59:08.340 align:start position:0%
going to be it'll be higher for others
 
01:59:11.089 --> 01:59:11.099 align:start position:0%
understood it would have been 15 dollars
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
for my wife and I combined on a policy
 
01:59:16.129 --> 01:59:16.139 align:start position:0%
it would have been 24 increase if I had
 
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
two drivers and two vehicles it would
 
01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
have been a 35 increase
 
01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:22.010 align:start position:0%
have been a 35 increase
um

01:59:22.010 --> 01:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:25.790 --> 01:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
so annually correct because a lot of the
 
01:59:27.709 --> 01:59:27.719 align:start position:0%
policies now are written for six months
 
01:59:30.890 --> 01:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
so a rather minimal increase in the
 
01:59:32.450 --> 01:59:32.460 align:start position:0%
amount of premiums to receive a
 
01:59:34.490 --> 01:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
substantial increase in coverage correct
 
01:59:36.830 --> 01:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
yes but I will offer one thing to you
 
01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm gonna I like being
 
01:59:40.250 --> 01:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
honest about both sides of the coin here
 
01:59:42.589 --> 01:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
every time you raise limits and you
 
01:59:44.209 --> 01:59:44.219 align:start position:0%
raise prices you will have people that
 
01:59:46.010 --> 01:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
will not be able to afford it so with it
 
01:59:48.410 --> 01:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
there is a law diminishing returns
 
01:59:50.570 --> 01:59:50.580 align:start position:0%
um so I I you know I was trying to be
 
01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
very careful that you don't raise it so
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
much that we get those people that are
 
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
are at least getting coverage
 
01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.729 align:start position:0%
are at least getting coverage
voluntarily

01:59:58.729 --> 01:59:58.739 align:start position:0%
voluntarily
 
02:00:01.010 --> 02:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
not mandatory that we don't want too
 
02:00:02.750 --> 02:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
many people to say I'm sorry this is too
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
expensive I'm not going to do it so
 
02:00:06.830 --> 02:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
we're we're um
 
02:00:09.649 --> 02:00:09.659 align:start position:0%
um sensitive to that as well
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chairman my other remarks would
 
02:00:14.209 --> 02:00:14.219 align:start position:0%
be better shared in I believe in
 
02:00:15.649 --> 02:00:15.659 align:start position:0%
executive sessions so thank you very
 
02:00:17.689 --> 02:00:17.699 align:start position:0%
much so yeah so well let me just follow
 
02:00:19.010 --> 02:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
up on that you know when you were saying
 
02:00:20.930 --> 02:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
these numbers incremental fifteen twenty
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
dollars that that's for for everybody in
 
02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
the room here because I would venture
 
02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
that nobody in this room has an SR-22
 
02:00:31.129 --> 02:00:31.139 align:start position:0%
correct if you have an SR-22 it's not
 
02:00:33.169 --> 02:00:33.179 align:start position:0%
going to be just 15 or 20 dollars more
 
02:00:37.250 --> 02:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
no I for the DWI yes that is I wasn't
 
02:00:41.290 --> 02:00:41.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:44.810 --> 02:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
I remember and this was a very long long
 
02:00:48.050 --> 02:00:48.060 align:start position:0%
time ago and when I was in Vermont and
 
02:00:54.229 --> 02:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh uh my my insurance uh quadrupled
 
02:00:56.689 --> 02:00:56.699 align:start position:0%
when they the the state of Vermont
 
02:00:58.669 --> 02:00:58.679 align:start position:0%
decided that I had won too many speeding
 
02:00:58.679 --> 02:00:59.570 align:start position:0%
decided that I had won too many speeding
tickets

02:00:59.570 --> 02:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
so when your insurance is going to
 
02:01:03.290 --> 02:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
quadruple anyway if you get a DWI that's
 
02:01:05.570 --> 02:01:05.580 align:start position:0%
just basically oh this wasn't DWIs these
 
02:01:08.330 --> 02:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
are purely speeding tickets on Route 91
 
02:01:11.450 --> 02:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
because I was too far away from Maria
 
02:01:16.430 --> 02:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
from everything else so I I I guess we
 
02:01:18.770 --> 02:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
it will we need to know how how much it
 
02:01:21.169 --> 02:01:21.179 align:start position:0%
really costs because the issue is not so
 
02:01:24.050 --> 02:01:24.060 align:start position:0%
much for the average Joe to get these
 
02:01:26.270 --> 02:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
higher limits because they're available
 
02:01:28.970 --> 02:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
to them now they don't they don't need a
 
02:01:31.070 --> 02:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
law to tell them that it really is a
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
good idea to you know to get these new
 
02:01:36.169 --> 02:01:36.179 align:start position:0%
the 5100 all right it's really good 50
 
02:01:38.209 --> 02:01:38.219 align:start position:0%
you know it's a good idea everybody
 
02:01:40.729 --> 02:01:40.739 align:start position:0%
should have that okay and if it's only
 
02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
20 you know you know the premium
 
02:01:44.570 --> 02:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
increase is less that's fine that's good
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's we're doing a good job in
 
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the issue is really the
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
people who don't want to buy it and the
 
02:01:55.370 --> 02:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
SR-22 people and that now you've now you
 
02:01:57.290 --> 02:01:57.300 align:start position:0%
not only this is like this is a double
 
02:01:59.570 --> 02:01:59.580 align:start position:0%
penalty for not only getting that as
 
02:02:01.970 --> 02:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
SR22 but you know you're going to you
 
02:02:03.470 --> 02:02:03.480 align:start position:0%

cross-section of different quotes from a
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
single individual to someone with a DWI

02:02:19.310 --> 02:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
the cost increases are and I will share
 
02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
with you folks and if it's not to be
 
02:02:23.450 --> 02:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
it's not if it's too much you feel it is
 
02:02:24.770 --> 02:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
it's not to be that'll be fine Mr
 
02:02:27.169 --> 02:02:27.179 align:start position:0%
chairman okay great thank you uh
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative meckler is your hand
 
02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
still up from before or do you have
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
another question okay uh representative
 
02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
my question so I think we'll answer it
 
02:02:45.229 --> 02:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
but you know my concern is you I just to
 
02:02:47.209 --> 02:02:47.219 align:start position:0%
be honest I've got two teenage daughters
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
one's driving right now
 
02:02:51.770 --> 02:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
um one's coming up to be driving God
 
02:02:53.810 --> 02:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
help me
 
02:02:56.750 --> 02:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
and you know my daughter does have her
 
02:02:59.570 --> 02:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
insurance on her vehicle but this
 
02:03:03.290 --> 02:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
increase for a 16 17 year old they are
 
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
trying to do the right thing and if you
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
keep increasing this they not may not be
 
02:03:09.709 --> 02:03:09.719 align:start position:0%
able to afford it so then they're not
 
02:03:11.629 --> 02:03:11.639 align:start position:0%
going to have it if you keep increasing
 
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
these limits would this not then deter
 
02:03:16.490 --> 02:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
these young people who are trying to do
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
the right thing by having a coverage
 
02:03:21.290 --> 02:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
make it so that they can't even afford
 
02:03:22.609 --> 02:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
it anymore
 
02:03:24.709 --> 02:03:24.719 align:start position:0%
that is a concern we don't keep
 
02:03:26.330 --> 02:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
increasing it I'll just comment that as
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
I said before we haven't done it in 30
 
02:03:30.169 --> 02:03:30.179 align:start position:0%
years but I respect what you're saying
 
02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
and I wouldn't want your daughters to
 
02:03:34.250 --> 02:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
then choose not to have coverage so
 
02:03:36.410 --> 02:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
that's why I'll present I should have
 
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
done it I apologize for not doing more I
 
02:03:41.629 --> 02:03:41.639 align:start position:0%
will present to the committee by Friday
 
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
A A variation of different things and um
 
02:03:47.629 --> 02:03:47.639 align:start position:0%
of what the price increases could or
 
02:03:50.330 --> 02:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
could not will be
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
um under different scenarios and then
 
02:03:55.129 --> 02:03:55.139 align:start position:0%
everyone can look at them and be better
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
informed to make a decision
 
02:03:58.189 --> 02:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
because I don't want that to happen
 
02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
either the last thing I want to do is to
 
02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
have fewer people voluntarily choose to
 
02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
get insurance auto insurance in New
 
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we wouldn't we wouldn't had to
 
02:04:09.530 --> 02:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
put more pressure on have to have
 
02:04:11.870 --> 02:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
mandatory because people dropped it okay
 
02:04:14.810 --> 02:04:14.820 align:start position:0%
representative greeson you're up
 
02:04:16.729 --> 02:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and I thank you
 
02:04:18.709 --> 02:04:18.719 align:start position:0%
representative infantine uh when you
 
02:04:22.129 --> 02:04:22.139 align:start position:0%
include these uh these samples the one
 
02:04:25.010 --> 02:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh aspect of insurance and insurance
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
premiums that has not been discussed so
 
02:04:30.770 --> 02:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
far has been the deductible and so when
 
02:04:33.169 --> 02:04:33.179 align:start position:0%
you run your scenarios uh would you
 
02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
please include
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
anything from a 500 deductible to a two
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar deductible or something
 
02:04:42.050 --> 02:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
along those lines just to just to show
 
02:04:44.750 --> 02:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
that your deductible can also uh change
 
02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
the amount of your premium so while
 
02:04:48.649 --> 02:04:48.659 align:start position:0%
you're you may you may double the
 
02:04:51.410 --> 02:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
coverage but maybe you go from 500 to a
 
02:04:52.970 --> 02:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar deductible and you're
 
02:04:55.609 --> 02:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
now back down to where you were I know
 
02:04:57.709 --> 02:04:57.719 align:start position:0%
you know what's what's the difference
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
maybe you can't come up with a thousand
 
02:05:02.089 --> 02:05:02.099 align:start position:0%
dollars I don't know but that's just way
 
02:05:04.129 --> 02:05:04.139 align:start position:0%
if it's the if it's the monthly amount
 
02:05:06.290 --> 02:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
that's scaring people away then there
 
02:05:08.209 --> 02:05:08.219 align:start position:0%
are ways of bringing that back down so
 
02:05:10.609 --> 02:05:10.619 align:start position:0%
it's just just ask if if you would mind
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
including that in your scenarios not at
 
02:05:14.930 --> 02:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
all it's very simple for us to do with
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh some a bunch of computer programs we
 
02:05:18.290 --> 02:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
have in place so that's why I'm
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
confident I can get all this to you on
 
02:05:21.350 --> 02:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
my Friday
 
02:05:23.709 --> 02:05:23.719 align:start position:0%
and I will include different deductibles
 
02:05:26.689 --> 02:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
okay uh we're now recycling through for
 
02:05:28.370 --> 02:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
people who've already spoke so uh
 
02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
representative Terry here first
 
02:05:32.990 --> 02:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
yeah quick question uh Mr chairman uh
 
02:05:37.310 --> 02:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
for you uh as a uh as a lifelong Pastor
 
02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
in Theologian I would always be somewhat
 
02:05:40.250 --> 02:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
embarrassed when somebody would raise
 
02:05:43.250 --> 02:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
his or her hand and ask uh Pastor what
 
02:05:44.689 --> 02:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
did what did you mean by the term super
 
02:05:44.699 --> 02:05:46.310 align:start position:0%
did what did you mean by the term super
lapsarian

02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
lapsarian
 
02:05:49.070 --> 02:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
because I had failed to Define it
 
02:05:50.570 --> 02:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
um I do not wish to put you on the spot
 
02:05:52.609 --> 02:05:52.619 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you're chuckling but for those
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
of us who are new to Insurance inside
 
02:05:58.370 --> 02:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
baseball what is Sr uh 22 okay so the
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
SR-22 is if you had too many speeding
 
02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
tickets ddui you're basically uh are
 
02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
forced to have to buy insurance it's
 
02:06:08.209 --> 02:06:08.219 align:start position:0%
basically it's a requirement you have to
 
02:06:10.189 --> 02:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
buy insurance and it's issued by the
 
02:06:12.050 --> 02:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
department of safety thank you
 
02:06:14.450 --> 02:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
representative Bartlett you're next
 
02:06:16.850 --> 02:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair of course the SR-22
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
is also a view of a DWI or you're an at
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:25.729 --> 02:06:25.739 align:start position:0%
um but um just I I think we need to
 
02:06:27.950 --> 02:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
address um representative Grayson's
 
02:06:29.810 --> 02:06:29.820 align:start position:0%
request regarding deductibles that only
 
02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
has to do with Collision coverage it
 
02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
does not apply to liability
 
02:06:36.649 --> 02:06:36.659 align:start position:0%
correct so that doesn't affect what
 
02:06:40.070 --> 02:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:43.010 --> 02:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
no worries good point okay

02:06:47.810 --> 02:06:47.820 align:start position:0%
so your hand just keeps popping up how
 
02:06:49.209 --> 02:06:49.219 align:start position:0%

actuary for the New Hampshire insurance
 
02:07:25.679 --> 02:07:27.050 align:start position:0%
actuary for the New Hampshire insurance
department

02:07:27.050 --> 02:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:07:29.209 --> 02:07:29.219 align:start position:0%
note that the as you mentioned the
 
02:07:31.550 --> 02:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
department is not taking the position on
 
02:07:32.810 --> 02:07:32.820 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
um but I thought I would Avail myself in
 
02:07:37.430 --> 02:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
case there are questions that uh you
 
02:07:38.890 --> 02:07:38.900 align:start position:0%
might that the committee might have
 
02:07:42.350 --> 02:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
regarding uh effects of raising the
 
02:07:44.270 --> 02:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
minimum limits
 
02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:45.410 align:start position:0%

the reason we don't take a position on
 
02:07:50.810 --> 02:07:50.820 align:start position:0%
the bill is because from the perspective
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
of the insurance department this isn't
 
02:07:54.649 --> 02:07:54.659 align:start position:0%
going to affect our day-to-day
 
02:07:56.930 --> 02:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
operations we'll be able to enforce this
 
02:07:59.870 --> 02:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
new law just as easy as we were able to
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
enforce the Old Law so
 
02:08:02.159 --> 02:08:03.310 align:start position:0%

02:08:45.950 --> 02:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
representing State Farm insurance
 
02:08:48.410 --> 02:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
company and speaking in opposition to
 
02:08:49.910 --> 02:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:08:52.270 --> 02:08:52.280 align:start position:0%
um I think that uh
 
02:08:54.530 --> 02:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
this is the first time I've spoken out
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
against it so I'm not sure that I'm
 
02:08:58.910 --> 02:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
creating any I've created any Ruckus
 
02:09:00.589 --> 02:09:00.599 align:start position:0%
that's going on
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
um but I do want to share the
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
perspective of State Farm on these uh on
 
02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
these this bill and these types of bills
 
02:09:10.550 --> 02:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
um because I think it's important for
 
02:09:12.649 --> 02:09:12.659 align:start position:0%
you to consider frankly I think
 
02:09:14.990 --> 02:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative infantine did a fantastic
 
02:09:18.350 --> 02:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
job of you know introducing the issues
 
02:09:20.510 --> 02:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
that are associated with this bill but
 
02:09:23.870 --> 02:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
in considering the context uh our bill
 
02:09:27.050 --> 02:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
any bill that raises mandatory minimums
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
either in New Hampshire anywhere else
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
State Farm inevitably concludes that it
 
02:09:36.890 --> 02:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
will do nothing more than raise the
 
02:09:38.930 --> 02:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
number of uninsured drivers and
 
02:09:40.689 --> 02:09:40.699 align:start position:0%
uninsured tax
 
02:09:44.149 --> 02:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
even though New Hampshire doesn't have
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
mandatory automobile insurance in
 
02:09:48.649 --> 02:09:48.659 align:start position:0%
general there are the people who are
 
02:09:50.990 --> 02:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
required to have them have insurance
 
02:09:52.970 --> 02:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
because of their driving history or
 
02:09:54.890 --> 02:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
their accident history
 
02:09:58.570 --> 02:09:58.580 align:start position:0%
um and those folks would be uh in effect
 
02:10:01.250 --> 02:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
uninsured and would have issues relating
 
02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:02.750 align:start position:0%
uninsured and would have issues relating
to

02:10:02.750 --> 02:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:10:05.570 --> 02:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
um you know uh whether living in New
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire requires them to drive without
 
02:10:11.169 --> 02:10:11.179 align:start position:0%
insurance without a license
 
02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire even though it's
 
02:10:17.169 --> 02:10:17.179 align:start position:0%
against the law so for that reason
 
02:10:20.350 --> 02:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
for those reasons we would oppose it
 
02:10:23.629 --> 02:10:23.639 align:start position:0%
also in general you know the question
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
about minimums uh and levels of
 
02:10:29.570 --> 02:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
insurance and coverages is really a
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
conversation that needs to happen
 
02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
between the agent and its cost is his or
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
her customer
 
02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
in other words you know that's their job
 
02:10:41.570 --> 02:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
to in effect layout the the information
 
02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
for the customer and I respective uh
 
02:10:47.149 --> 02:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
representative infantine
 
02:10:49.790 --> 02:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
um and uh it does not advise folks to
 
02:10:51.649 --> 02:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
have lower limits than as presented on
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
this bill however that's a fair point
 
02:10:57.169 --> 02:10:57.179 align:start position:0%
for him to make to his customers and
 
02:10:59.089 --> 02:10:59.099 align:start position:0%
when they make the decision about what
 
02:11:01.070 --> 02:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
type of insurance to buy and what types
 
02:11:04.669 --> 02:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
of limits they need so with that comment
 
02:11:07.490 --> 02:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
we oppose the bill and I will take
 
02:11:09.950 --> 02:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
questions if asked okay we do have a
 
02:11:11.689 --> 02:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
question representative Terry
 
02:11:14.930 --> 02:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
hello sir thank you for your testimony
 
02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
do I understand you to say that it
 
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
actually becomes a counterproductive
 
02:11:25.790 --> 02:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
to raise mandatory minimums because of
 
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
the number of insurers who will actually
 
02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:38.030 --> 02:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes so the decision point is when you
 
02:11:39.770 --> 02:11:39.780 align:start position:0%
buy the insurance I would rather say
 
02:11:41.570 --> 02:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
it's when you
 
02:11:44.810 --> 02:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
when you buy the insurance initially so
 
02:11:48.109 --> 02:11:48.119 align:start position:0%
I suppose it's both when they drop when
 
02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
they renew or when they or when they buy
 
02:11:55.609 --> 02:11:55.619 align:start position:0%
it for the first time but inevitably at
 
02:11:58.729 --> 02:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
that point more more people choose to go
 
02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
uninsured so in an effort
 
02:12:03.790 --> 02:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
to attempt to
 
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
provide additional coverage minimum
 
02:12:12.109 --> 02:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
coverage for the insured which then may
 
02:12:13.729 --> 02:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
very well have
 
02:12:18.350 --> 02:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
a positive effect on a person who is
 
02:12:22.070 --> 02:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
involved in an accident with someone who
 
02:12:25.970 --> 02:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
is insured at the uh at the minimum
 
02:12:25.980 --> 02:12:27.589 align:start position:0%
is insured at the uh at the minimum
level

02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
um but if that minimum were to be to be
 
02:12:33.649 --> 02:12:33.659 align:start position:0%
greater and if the person was found to
 
02:12:36.589 --> 02:12:36.599 align:start position:0%
be at fault who has the mandatory
 
02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
minimum amount
 
02:12:42.050 --> 02:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
um it would actually be better that the
 
02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
person had the men the the lower
 
02:12:46.450 --> 02:12:46.460 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum and have the insurance
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
rather than not renew and have no
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
insurance where then the burden would
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
fall even in a would have a greater
 
02:12:58.910 --> 02:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
impact on the not at fault drivers
 
02:13:01.310 --> 02:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
Insurance having to go to uninsured
 
02:13:03.290 --> 02:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
motorists and uninsured property damage
 
02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:05.390 align:start position:0%
motorists and uninsured property damage
correct

02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:13:08.209 --> 02:13:08.219 align:start position:0%
uh represented respectfully I'm not too
 
02:13:11.870 --> 02:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
sure I followed the that entire question
 
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
um but I I will say that State Farm in
 
02:13:18.770 --> 02:13:18.780 align:start position:0%
general uh supports the premise that the
 
02:13:20.810 --> 02:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
more insured drivers and more insured
 
02:13:22.970 --> 02:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
accidents we have in New Hampshire it's
 
02:13:25.250 --> 02:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
better for New Hampshire in general New
 
02:13:29.209 --> 02:13:29.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
okay representative McCleary you have a
 
02:13:34.550 --> 02:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
question for Mr Hayes yes I do thank you
 
02:13:37.790 --> 02:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh chairman Mr Hayden so you don't want
 
02:13:39.770 --> 02:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
to raise the limits would you think
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
differently if there was mandatory
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
Insurance in the state in other words
 
02:13:48.589 --> 02:13:48.599 align:start position:0%
um if everybody had to have it would you
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
be in agreement or not an agreement to
 
02:13:54.350 --> 02:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
to raise the limits
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
um State Farm would oppose raising the
 
02:13:59.089 --> 02:13:59.099 align:start position:0%
mandatory limits if insurance was
 
02:14:03.530 --> 02:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:07.970 --> 02:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:09.530 --> 02:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:14:10.729 --> 02:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:14:12.589 --> 02:14:12.599 align:start position:0%
um did you say you have an estimate of
 
02:14:15.890 --> 02:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
how much it would increase uh premiums
 
02:14:21.530 --> 02:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh I do not have that estimate
 
02:14:26.450 --> 02:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
um and you know there's many factors
 
02:14:28.069 --> 02:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
that go into that
 
02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
um but I don't have an estimate
 
02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:30.830 align:start position:0%
um but I don't have an estimate
currently

02:14:30.830 --> 02:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:34.550 align:start position:0%
currently
follow-up

02:14:34.550 --> 02:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:36.890 --> 02:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
uh is there something else we could do
 
02:14:38.209 --> 02:14:38.219 align:start position:0%
with this bill for example on
 
02:14:40.490 --> 02:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
deductibles as uh someone else mentioned
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh earlier is there something else that
 
02:14:44.089 --> 02:14:44.099 align:start position:0%
could be done that would kind of balance
 
02:14:46.669 --> 02:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
us out that would allow us to uh
 
02:14:49.189 --> 02:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
have people with 50 000 in coverage but
 
02:14:51.709 --> 02:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
uh at the same price as a twenty five
 
02:14:55.010 --> 02:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:14:56.080 --> 02:14:56.090 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:56.090 --> 02:14:57.890 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

02:14:57.890 --> 02:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:15:00.830 --> 02:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
whose opportunities exist they would be
 
02:15:04.129 --> 02:15:04.139 align:start position:0%
better known to the agent than me uh you
 
02:15:06.109 --> 02:15:06.119 align:start position:0%
know they're the ones who know how
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
various coverages and limits and drivers
 
02:15:12.530 --> 02:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
and all the factors that go into the
 
02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
prices and insurance and to the extent
 
02:15:18.470 --> 02:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh the extent uh any concern we wanted
 
02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
to explore those options I think would
 
02:15:23.270 --> 02:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
be better left for the agent to discuss
 
02:15:25.609 --> 02:15:25.619 align:start position:0%
them rather than you know trying to work
 
02:15:27.950 --> 02:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
it out through this bill
 
02:15:29.810 --> 02:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
fair enough
 
02:15:32.209 --> 02:15:32.219 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you very much for your
 
02:15:32.219 --> 02:15:33.189 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you very much for your
testimony

02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:15:37.490 --> 02:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh terrible Colin Brittany shoot shoot
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:43.069 --> 02:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee my
 
02:15:45.709 --> 02:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
name is Brittany Shu I am the bureau
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
administrator of financial
 
02:15:48.649 --> 02:15:48.659 align:start position:0%
responsibility at the Division of Motor
 
02:15:51.890 --> 02:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
Vehicles we do not take a position but I
 
02:15:54.169 --> 02:15:54.179 align:start position:0%
did hear some conversation related to
 
02:15:58.729 --> 02:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
the SR22 policies and with that I wanted
 
02:16:02.330 --> 02:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
to highlight that line 16 and 17 of this
 
02:16:05.950 --> 02:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
bill do not reference RSA
 
02:16:11.149 --> 02:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
26420 and in that RSA of 264.20 it does
 
02:16:13.450 --> 02:16:13.460 align:start position:0%
speak to the minimum
 
02:16:17.149 --> 02:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
requirements of the 25 50 25
 
02:16:20.030 --> 02:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
so if there is an expectation that the
 
02:16:23.209 --> 02:16:23.219 align:start position:0%
SR-22 policy would follow suit with the
 
02:16:25.490 --> 02:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
minimum insurance requirements I just
 
02:16:28.850 --> 02:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring your attention to that
 
02:16:30.589 --> 02:16:30.599 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your time and if
 
02:16:32.690 --> 02:16:32.700 align:start position:0%
there's any questions I'll be happy
 
02:16:35.330 --> 02:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
um to answer so let me get this right so
 
02:16:39.469 --> 02:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass this would a uh the
 
02:16:41.690 --> 02:16:41.700 align:start position:0%
SRT if someone had an SR-22 they'd still
 
02:16:44.030 --> 02:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
have to get this because or they
 
02:16:46.730 --> 02:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to get on my assumption is
 
02:16:49.790 --> 02:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
they would have to get these new limits
 
02:16:53.209 --> 02:16:53.219 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I so what I
 
02:16:55.370 --> 02:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
think the clarification that um I would
 
02:16:57.110 --> 02:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
be looking for that if the insurance
 
02:17:00.290 --> 02:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
premiums were changing for the liability
 
02:17:03.230 --> 02:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
that the SR22 minimum levels would
 
02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
follow suit as well
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
they would yes okay that's what we're
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
assuming yeah okay
 
02:17:14.690 --> 02:17:14.700 align:start position:0%
great any other questions
 
02:17:16.490 --> 02:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
for Britney seeing none thank you very
 
02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:17.349 align:start position:0%
for Britney seeing none thank you very
much

02:17:17.349 --> 02:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh I'll look to the attendees is there
 
02:17:24.110 --> 02:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
anybody else who uh would like to speak
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
George you don't want to tell us what
 
02:17:27.650 --> 02:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
happened when we tried to raise med pay
 
02:17:36.169 --> 02:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:42.049 --> 02:17:42.059 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:42.059 --> 02:17:43.549 align:start position:0%
 
unmute

02:17:43.549 --> 02:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
unmute
 
02:17:45.049 --> 02:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
start video
 
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
you got it man oh thank you
 
02:17:51.469 --> 02:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
that's that's enough for today
 
02:17:54.770 --> 02:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
so I wasn't gonna
 
02:17:57.349 --> 02:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
testify but I appreciate your allowing
 
02:17:58.969 --> 02:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
me the opportunity
 
02:18:01.450 --> 02:18:01.460 align:start position:0%
um uh I I I
 
02:18:03.709 --> 02:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
have been talking to representative
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
infantine about the bill and uh uh
 
02:18:12.169 --> 02:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
uh reluctantly I have to say that uh
 
02:18:14.410 --> 02:18:14.420 align:start position:0%
I think our clients
 
02:18:16.330 --> 02:18:16.340 align:start position:0%
would would
 
02:18:19.730 --> 02:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill and and and uh let me
 
02:18:22.669 --> 02:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
make a couple of points um uh my my
 
02:18:25.730 --> 02:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
clients are the uh domestic insurance
 
02:18:27.889 --> 02:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
companies New Hampshire Association of
 
02:18:32.030 --> 02:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
domestic insurers uh and a large trade
 
02:18:34.250 --> 02:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
Association uh called the American
 
02:18:35.810 --> 02:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
Property and Casualty Insurance
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
Association I certainly understand uh
 
02:18:43.669 --> 02:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
Will's point that uh in uh well over 30
 
02:18:46.129 --> 02:18:46.139 align:start position:0%
years the limits have remained the same
 
02:18:49.310 --> 02:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
at 25.50 and I think you will find an
 
02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:50.389 align:start position:0%
at 25.50 and I think you will find an
interesting

02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
um when we'll send you the list of
 
02:18:56.089 --> 02:18:56.099 align:start position:0%
states and one point that I just noticed
 
02:18:59.150 --> 02:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
that I hadn't noticed before is that
 
02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:00.370 align:start position:0%
that I hadn't noticed before is that
um

02:19:00.370 --> 02:19:00.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:03.650 --> 02:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
the under the bill the limit for
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
property damage liability would go from
 
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
25 000 to 50 000. I'd just like to
 
02:19:11.089 --> 02:19:11.099 align:start position:0%
mention that that would be the highest
 
02:19:13.070 --> 02:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
in the country
 
02:19:16.849 --> 02:19:16.859 align:start position:0%
um in fact the highest uh presently in
 
02:19:18.530 --> 02:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
the country is where we are right now
 
02:19:21.049 --> 02:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
which is at 25 000. that's where the
 
02:19:24.589 --> 02:19:24.599 align:start position:0%
property damage liability so question do
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
you do you really want to go
 
02:19:29.450 --> 02:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
uh to that level
 
02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
um again I think it would be helpful for
 
02:19:33.730 --> 02:19:33.740 align:start position:0%
you to look at the at the limits that
 
02:19:37.009 --> 02:19:37.019 align:start position:0%
other states do have we're kind of right
 
02:19:38.690 --> 02:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
in the middle as well as representative
 
02:19:42.530 --> 02:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
infantine said uh we all agree that
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
people if they can afford it should have
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
limits higher than twenty five thousand
 
02:19:51.050 --> 02:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
dollars per person uh injured and fifty
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
thousand for the total liability
 
02:19:55.730 --> 02:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
coverage for an accident but there are
 
02:19:58.490 --> 02:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
many people who can't afford it and uh
 
02:20:00.530 --> 02:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
the point has been raised and I I
 
02:20:03.410 --> 02:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
certainly agree with it that that you
 
02:20:05.990 --> 02:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
would basically disenfranchise a lot of
 
02:20:09.230 --> 02:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
people from having insurance if you if
 
02:20:13.070 --> 02:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
you uh mandated these uh these limits
 
02:20:16.490 --> 02:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
and I leave it to you to decide what the
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
best policy is certainly uh
 
02:20:22.910 --> 02:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh anyone who wants higher limits can
 
02:20:26.450 --> 02:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
can buy them uh but they're not forced
 
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
to have them so thank you
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
so George the question I would have is
 
02:20:35.330 --> 02:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
if if we were to raise the rate
 
02:20:38.510 --> 02:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
um the law of averages in terms of the
 
02:20:40.429 --> 02:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
fact that now you're forcing everyone to
 
02:20:45.410 --> 02:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
have these higher uh minimums that
 
02:20:49.250 --> 02:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
um would there would would that the
 
02:20:52.849 --> 02:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
increased cost for those minimums versus
 
02:20:54.770 --> 02:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
let's say the people who are already now
 
02:20:58.190 --> 02:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
buying higher Insurance net rate now so
 
02:20:59.690 --> 02:20:59.700 align:start position:0%
if we the numbers were here as well it's
 
02:21:02.510 --> 02:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
only 15 or 20 dollars more to to double
 
02:21:05.330 --> 02:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
your minimums would that number still
 
02:21:09.410 --> 02:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
hold true or would uh these numbers
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
actually go down if more people are now
 
02:21:14.450 --> 02:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
have the higher limits because the law
 
02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
of averages would average it out or or
 
02:21:18.830 --> 02:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
do we have any idea what would happen to
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
to these
 
02:21:24.530 --> 02:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
that's a perfect question Mr chairman
 
02:21:27.230 --> 02:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
for Christian citarella who you you let
 
02:21:29.389 --> 02:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
get off without even asking him a
 
02:21:29.399 --> 02:21:30.429 align:start position:0%
get off without even asking him a
question

02:21:30.429 --> 02:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
he's the actuary and that is an
 
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
excellent question I can Hazard a guess
 
02:21:37.130 --> 02:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
but it would be a guess and and I also
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
think will volunteered uh to uh get you
 
02:21:43.610 --> 02:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
some figures about what is the cost uh
 
02:21:47.150 --> 02:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
of going of doubling the the minimum
 
02:21:51.170 --> 02:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
limits and and I I don't want to give
 
02:21:53.150 --> 02:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
Christian more work but I would think
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
you you might want to ask I can because
 
02:21:57.770 --> 02:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
so Christian you're still on online uh
 
02:21:59.630 --> 02:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
are you did you hear what my question
 
02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:01.550 align:start position:0%
are you did you hear what my question
was

02:22:01.550 --> 02:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:03.469 align:start position:0%
was
oh

02:22:03.469 --> 02:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:22:06.889 --> 02:22:06.899 align:start position:0%
do you mind re uh restating it yeah so
 
02:22:10.010 --> 02:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
so we're in terms of the idea uh that
 
02:22:11.809 --> 02:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
one of the argues of if you had things
 
02:22:14.450 --> 02:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
that are mandatory then things should go
 
02:22:16.969 --> 02:22:16.979 align:start position:0%
down because everybody is now people
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
were buying it who weren't buying it
 
02:22:22.190 --> 02:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
um so uh vice versa the same question is
 
02:22:24.770 --> 02:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
right now the discussion is that if you
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
were to buy a higher minimums right now
 
02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
um it's only going to be like 15 or 20
 
02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
dollars more for that 50 year old male
 
02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
okay so the question I would have is is
 
02:22:40.010 --> 02:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
if we mandate this uh that that uh the
 
02:22:43.790 --> 02:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
minimums are now that higher limit would
 
02:22:47.570 --> 02:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
that number stay at 15 or 20 would it go
 
02:22:50.690 --> 02:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
down would it go up uh what would happen
 
02:22:54.290 --> 02:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
to the the all those who who buy higher
 
02:22:56.750 --> 02:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
higher limits now what would be the
 
02:23:00.170 --> 02:23:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:00.180 --> 02:23:04.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:06.770 --> 02:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't go down
 
02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
um but I would uh first of all
 
02:23:12.889 --> 02:23:12.899 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of assumptions there and
 
02:23:15.050 --> 02:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
and it's hard to it's always hard to
 
02:23:18.170 --> 02:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
come up with it with a point estimate
 
02:23:22.250 --> 02:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
however when I did my own analysis with
 
02:23:24.889 --> 02:23:24.899 align:start position:0%
the limited information that we have at
 
02:23:26.450 --> 02:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
the department
 
02:23:29.690 --> 02:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
and looking across you know not
 
02:23:31.730 --> 02:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
separating out by age group just looking
 
02:23:34.610 --> 02:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
across all premium sold
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
um considering the fact that rough like
 
02:23:40.610 --> 02:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
some less than 20 somewhere between 10
 
02:23:43.190 --> 02:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
and 20 percent of policies are at
 
02:23:45.710 --> 02:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
minimum limits and so these these
 
02:23:47.090 --> 02:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
changes wouldn't affect everyone
 
02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:48.650 align:start position:0%
changes wouldn't affect everyone
obviously

02:23:48.650 --> 02:23:48.660 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:23:48.660 --> 02:23:49.490 align:start position:0%
obviously
um

02:23:49.490 --> 02:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
it at least in the immediate time frame
 
02:23:56.450 --> 02:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
I I don't think it's
 
02:23:58.370 --> 02:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
with all due respect to representative
 
02:24:01.490 --> 02:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
infantine I think the s that estimate is
 
02:24:04.370 --> 02:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
low for the average person who has
 
02:24:06.410 --> 02:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
minimum limits
 
02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
um I think it would be more in the 50 to
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
100 range increase per annu annual uh
 
02:24:16.809 --> 02:24:16.819 align:start position:0%
policy however over time
 
02:24:20.270 --> 02:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
there is something to be said about you
 
02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:20.929 align:start position:0%
there is something to be said about you
know

02:24:20.929 --> 02:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:24:20.939 --> 02:24:21.650 align:start position:0%
know
um

02:24:21.650 --> 02:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:24.530 --> 02:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
premium leveling out
 
02:24:26.750 --> 02:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
now the question is
 
02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:28.550 align:start position:0%
now the question is
whether

02:24:28.550 --> 02:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
whether
 
02:24:31.690 --> 02:24:31.700 align:start position:0%
you know having the higher limits
 
02:24:35.330 --> 02:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
causing you know causing folks to go
 
02:24:39.230 --> 02:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
without insurance to you know opting out
 
02:24:41.450 --> 02:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
how does that affect
 
02:24:44.389 --> 02:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
you know rates for everyone
 
02:24:46.610 --> 02:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
in the work that I've done you know
 
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
almost annually we have a bill to make
 
02:24:53.690 --> 02:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
insurance mandatory and so I do look at
 
02:24:58.130 --> 02:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:00.050 --> 02:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
you know first of all we don't have a
 
02:25:02.929 --> 02:25:02.939 align:start position:0%
lot of folks that don't have coverage
 
02:25:05.809 --> 02:25:05.819 align:start position:0%
generally speaking
 
02:25:05.819 --> 02:25:06.770 align:start position:0%
generally speaking
um

02:25:06.770 --> 02:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
we had you know it is well covered and
 
02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:12.830 align:start position:0%
we had you know it is well covered and
so

02:25:12.830 --> 02:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:25:15.530 --> 02:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
I don't think that the amount that folks
 
02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
would save by having lower uninsured
 
02:25:22.730 --> 02:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
underinsured motorist coverage
 
02:25:27.050 --> 02:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
would be that noticeable over time
 
02:25:27.060 --> 02:25:28.309 align:start position:0%
would be that noticeable over time
um

02:25:28.309 --> 02:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:31.070 --> 02:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
long answer to say that it's
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
likely going to be hit
 
02:25:35.870 --> 02:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
it's going you know the effect will be
 
02:25:37.550 --> 02:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
on the folks that currently are at
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
minimum limits
 
02:25:41.630 --> 02:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
you know whether that number is thirty
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
dollars a year or a hundred dollars a
 
02:25:44.929 --> 02:25:44.939 align:start position:0%
year probably somewhere in between
 
02:25:49.309 --> 02:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
depending on the individual and um
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
and I don't see that changing much over
 
02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:55.969 align:start position:0%
and I don't see that changing much over
time

02:25:55.969 --> 02:25:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:58.730 --> 02:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
you say that's about 10 to 15 percent
 
02:26:01.610 --> 02:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
is so that's my estimate of the
 
02:26:03.770 --> 02:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
population George might know better but
 
02:26:06.170 --> 02:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
the population that is currently opting
 
02:26:07.790 --> 02:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
for minimum limits
 
02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:08.990 align:start position:0%
for minimum limits
okay

02:26:08.990 --> 02:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:26:10.610 --> 02:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
do you know that number George is that
 
02:26:12.950 --> 02:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
10 15 sound right
 
02:26:17.570 --> 02:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
it's it it sounds right yes but that's
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
just the other thing I'll mention is
 
02:26:21.290 --> 02:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
that I did do a survey of just a handful
 
02:26:22.730 --> 02:26:22.740 align:start position:0%
of the bigger
 
02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
um insurers carriers in the state and
 
02:26:28.670 --> 02:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
generally speaking it's pretty it's it's
 
02:26:31.010 --> 02:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
pretty uh consistent that there's gonna
 
02:26:34.370 --> 02:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
that if you do go from a 2550 to a 50
 
02:26:34.380 --> 02:26:36.170 align:start position:0%
that if you do go from a 2550 to a 50
hundred

02:26:36.170 --> 02:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
02:26:38.450 --> 02:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
um you know uh liability
 
02:26:42.170 --> 02:26:42.180 align:start position:0%
that the the rate is the the the
 
02:26:44.030 --> 02:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
adjustment in rates is going to be an
 
02:26:47.870 --> 02:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
additional 27 to 30 percent
 
02:26:50.929 --> 02:26:50.939 align:start position:0%
on just the portion of Premium
 
02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
associated with liability
 
02:26:56.809 --> 02:26:56.819 align:start position:0%
and so generally speaking
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
the amount of Premium you pay for
 
02:27:02.270 --> 02:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
liability and and that's bodily injury
 
02:27:05.030 --> 02:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
or or property damage although the
 
02:27:08.809 --> 02:27:08.819 align:start position:0%
property damage increase in in uh limits
 
02:27:12.349 --> 02:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
is way it's a smaller increase but we'll
 
02:27:14.270 --> 02:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
leave that aside for now
 
02:27:15.770 --> 02:27:15.780 align:start position:0%
um the amount of Premium that is
 
02:27:17.809 --> 02:27:17.819 align:start position:0%
associated with though with those pieces
 
02:27:21.889 --> 02:27:21.899 align:start position:0%
of coverage make up approximately 25 to
 
02:27:23.929 --> 02:27:23.939 align:start position:0%
30 percent of your premium so when you
 
02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
take those numbers together
 
02:27:29.210 --> 02:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
it comes to depending on the the company
 
02:27:32.570 --> 02:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
somewhere around five to ten percent
 
02:27:35.870 --> 02:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
increase in overall premium is is what
 
02:27:38.929 --> 02:27:38.939 align:start position:0%
I've done in in my overview
 
02:27:41.330 --> 02:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
okay you have a thousand dollar policy
 
02:27:45.610 --> 02:27:45.620 align:start position:0%
that's how I came to the 50 to 100 okay
 
02:27:47.809 --> 02:27:47.819 align:start position:0%
uh representative Burroughs do you have
 
02:27:50.809 --> 02:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
a question for attorney russos or
 
02:27:53.330 --> 02:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
which is citala
 
02:27:56.690 --> 02:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
you all said okay uh thank you guys very
 
02:27:59.690 --> 02:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
much and is there I see no more hands up
 
02:28:02.990 --> 02:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
on either side panelists or attendees
 
02:28:05.570 --> 02:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
so we will close I I guess before we
 
02:28:05.580 --> 02:28:07.490 align:start position:0%
so we will close I I guess before we
leave

02:28:07.490 --> 02:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
leave
 
02:28:07.500 --> 02:28:08.270 align:start position:0%
leave
um

02:28:08.270 --> 02:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:12.050 --> 02:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
so this Bill had six support uh seven
 
02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
opposed uh one neutral and I would also
 
02:28:18.050 --> 02:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
say this is a good time for all the
 
02:28:20.389 --> 02:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to pull out
 
02:28:23.090 --> 02:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
your auto policy and look at your
 
02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
numbers you'll be very surprised what
 
02:28:28.969 --> 02:28:28.979 align:start position:0%
you have okay well thank you all very
 
02:28:31.610 --> 02:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
much and we're
 
02:28:33.650 --> 02:28:33.660 align:start position:0%
we're ready to move into our final
 
02:28:33.660 --> 02:28:36.290 align:start position:0%
we're ready to move into our final
hearing

02:28:36.290 --> 02:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:28:40.670 --> 02:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
and okay well you're on
 
02:28:42.410 --> 02:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mr chairman I'm
 
02:28:44.030 --> 02:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
trying to click my video on but I don't
 
02:28:45.889 --> 02:28:45.899 align:start position:0%
know what's working
 
02:28:47.870 --> 02:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
um before I as representative will
 
02:28:50.389 --> 02:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
infantine uh Hillsborough 13 hopefully I
 
02:28:52.969 --> 02:28:52.979 align:start position:0%
have not worn my welcome out here today
 
02:28:54.910 --> 02:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
I apologize for some of these complex
 
02:28:58.010 --> 02:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
issues that I brought up and um I
 
02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate your diligence this one's
 
02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
going to be much more simple
 
02:29:04.730 --> 02:29:04.740 align:start position:0%
it all it sounds uh pretty bad when you
 
02:29:06.770 --> 02:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
look at it House Bill 518 relative to
 
02:29:08.330 --> 02:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
rebates under the governing unfair
 
02:29:10.490 --> 02:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
Insurance practices in the state of New
 
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have extremely tight
 
02:29:15.110 --> 02:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
laws regarding rebating we don't want
 
02:29:17.389 --> 02:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
Shenanigans and games going on where
 
02:29:20.030 --> 02:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
people are rebating uh giving Kickbacks
 
02:29:22.370 --> 02:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
to on their insurance commissions or
 
02:29:25.670 --> 02:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
giving out a car or motorcycle or things
 
02:29:27.590 --> 02:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
like that to entice someone a group of
 
02:29:29.389 --> 02:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
people to buy insurance from them so we
 
02:29:31.490 --> 02:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
have very strict rules and those rules
 
02:29:34.130 --> 02:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
are very strict for us as individuals I
 
02:29:36.410 --> 02:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
cannot pay anyone a commission unless
 
02:29:38.809 --> 02:29:38.819 align:start position:0%
they have a new insurance license
 
02:29:41.450 --> 02:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
so what happens is we like to give our
 
02:29:44.030 --> 02:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
commissions back to our employees people
 
02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
10 15 people work for me they pay a
 
02:29:48.550 --> 02:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
thousand two thousand dollars a year
 
02:29:51.170 --> 02:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
for insurance I don't really need to
 
02:29:53.389 --> 02:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
make you know 15 commission off my
 
02:29:56.389 --> 02:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
employees as a employee perk I like to
 
02:29:58.610 --> 02:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
give them their commissions back many of
 
02:30:00.830 --> 02:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
our agents do that but if I have 15
 
02:30:03.530 --> 02:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
people in my office maybe only 12 or 13
 
02:30:06.290 --> 02:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
of them are licensed insurance agents
 
02:30:08.210 --> 02:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
one of them may be in Human Resources
 
02:30:10.010 --> 02:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
one might be in accounting one might be
 
02:30:12.050 --> 02:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
a clerical uh and they don't have an
 
02:30:14.450 --> 02:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
insurance license so legally I am not
 
02:30:16.849 --> 02:30:16.859 align:start position:0%
allowed to give some of those
 
02:30:19.309 --> 02:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
commissions back
 
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
um to those employees so I can only give
 
02:30:22.969 --> 02:30:22.979 align:start position:0%
like three quarters of my employees the
 
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
perk of giving back some of their
 
02:30:27.050 --> 02:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
commissions some agents give 25 some
 
02:30:29.450 --> 02:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
give 50 I give a hundred percent of the
 
02:30:30.770 --> 02:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
commissions back
 
02:30:33.110 --> 02:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
and it's illegal to do that to anyone
 
02:30:34.570 --> 02:30:34.580 align:start position:0%
who does not have an insurance license
 
02:30:37.130 --> 02:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
so this did pass your committee last
 
02:30:39.349 --> 02:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
year the best of my knowledge and it got
 
02:30:41.330 --> 02:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
died because of covet all we want to do
 
02:30:42.830 --> 02:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
is make ourselves legal Mr chairman
 
02:30:44.389 --> 02:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
because I know some of our people some
 
02:30:47.630 --> 02:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
of our agents in New Hampshire are are
 
02:30:47.640 --> 02:30:48.889 align:start position:0%
of our agents in New Hampshire are are
um

02:30:48.889 --> 02:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:51.770 --> 02:30:51.780 align:start position:0%
um are not in compliance with the law by
 
02:30:53.570 --> 02:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
giving their commissions back to people
 
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
in their employee that do not have an
 
02:30:58.370 --> 02:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
insurance license so this is crafted
 
02:31:00.410 --> 02:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
very specifically it does not say you
 
02:31:03.230 --> 02:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
must it just says it's not illegal to do
 
02:31:05.450 --> 02:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
it so some insurance agent says I don't
 
02:31:07.790 --> 02:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
want to do that uh I I know there's some
 
02:31:09.349 --> 02:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
concern that some people that sell other
 
02:31:11.270 --> 02:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
types of life insurance and annuity
 
02:31:13.309 --> 02:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
products don't want this to happen to
 
02:31:16.070 --> 02:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
them well they're that's fine they're
 
02:31:18.290 --> 02:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
not forced to nor does anyone want to
 
02:31:19.670 --> 02:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
make them
 
02:31:21.590 --> 02:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
um this is just any insurance agent who
 
02:31:23.570 --> 02:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
would like to give back some commissions
 
02:31:25.610 --> 02:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
to their employees
 
02:31:29.090 --> 02:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
their employees are not licensed like my
 
02:31:31.490 --> 02:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
accounting people are not and you know
 
02:31:33.530 --> 02:31:33.540 align:start position:0%
my human resource people are not
 
02:31:35.630 --> 02:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
Insurance licensed I can give them their
 
02:31:37.370 --> 02:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
commissions back without being a
 
02:31:39.290 --> 02:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
follower of the law
 
02:31:41.210 --> 02:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
no harm no file that's all I'm trying to
 
02:31:41.220 --> 02:31:42.530 align:start position:0%
no harm no file that's all I'm trying to
do

02:31:42.530 --> 02:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:31:42.540 --> 02:31:43.490 align:start position:0%
do
um

02:31:43.490 --> 02:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:46.370 --> 02:31:46.380 align:start position:0%

demoted you and then re-promoted you
 
02:32:44.450 --> 02:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
so I didn't realize that you were also's
 
02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
fiance you were going to testify here so
 
02:32:49.010 --> 02:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
welcome again
 
02:32:51.469 --> 02:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
uh well thank you chairman um I was
 
02:32:53.690 --> 02:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
again I'm this is not my area of
 
02:32:56.510 --> 02:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
expertise but I was the other for the
 
02:32:58.849 --> 02:32:58.859 align:start position:0%
year for the other hearing um you know
 
02:33:00.170 --> 02:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
the commissioner asked me to just stay
 
02:33:02.330 --> 02:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
again if you had any questions I'll just
 
02:33:04.429 --> 02:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
say you know we formally do not take a
 
02:33:07.010 --> 02:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
position but the department has no
 
02:33:10.190 --> 02:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
problem in the with this new language it
 
02:33:13.370 --> 02:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
would be very easy to enforce and or
 
02:33:16.969 --> 02:33:16.979 align:start position:0%
unin or stop in the other enforcement of
 
02:33:18.530 --> 02:33:18.540 align:start position:0%
the prohibition
 
02:33:18.540 --> 02:33:19.190 align:start position:0%
the prohibition
um

02:33:19.190 --> 02:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:21.730 --> 02:33:21.740 align:start position:0%
it's it's very well defined it's clear
 
02:33:24.950 --> 02:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
we we know who is you know who is an
 
02:33:27.230 --> 02:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
employee who is not and uh the number of
 
02:33:30.590 --> 02:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
people that we're talking about I I my
 
02:33:32.090 --> 02:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
our impression is that it's a very small
 
02:33:34.870 --> 02:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
number of people as as uh representative
 
02:33:37.010 --> 02:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
mentioned then it
 
02:33:38.929 --> 02:33:38.939 align:start position:0%
it's not something the department has
 
02:33:41.690 --> 02:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
been worried about to this point maybe
 
02:33:42.969 --> 02:33:42.979 align:start position:0%
we should be on
 
02:33:46.510 --> 02:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:50.990 --> 02:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay it's not has not been a problem
 
02:33:53.389 --> 02:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
um right it has not been a problem it
 
02:33:56.210 --> 02:33:56.220 align:start position:0%
has not been uh an area a priority at
 
02:33:58.190 --> 02:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
the department
 
02:33:58.200 --> 02:33:59.450 align:start position:0%
the department
so

02:33:59.450 --> 02:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:34:01.730 --> 02:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
okay is there any other
 
02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
questions uh for
 
02:34:07.190 --> 02:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
Mrs uh seeing none uh thank you very
 
02:34:10.730 --> 02:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
much again Christian and uh I guess if
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
um no hands are up
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
in the attendees and I think we're all
 
02:34:19.309 --> 02:34:19.319 align:start position:0%
set so uh the there were three support
 
02:34:22.370 --> 02:34:22.380 align:start position:0%
no opposed and the insurance department
 
02:34:25.490 --> 02:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
is well not just the apartment yeah the
 
02:34:27.110 --> 02:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
insurance agents and domestic insurance
 
02:34:29.809 --> 02:34:29.819 align:start position:0%
companies and they're all they're all
 
02:34:33.590 --> 02:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill so with that uh
 
02:34:35.690 --> 02:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
we'll close the public hearing
 
02:34:38.889 --> 02:34:38.899 align:start position:0%
on uh house bill 518.
 
02:34:42.590 --> 02:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
and I think we're all set until 1 15.
 
02:34:45.110 --> 02:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
see we got right on schedule
 
02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:47.510 align:start position:0%
see we got right on schedule
perfect

02:34:47.510 --> 02:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:50.570 align:start position:0%
perfect
so

02:34:50.570 --> 02:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:50.580 --> 02:34:52.070 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:53.630 align:start position:0%
uh
Keith

02:34:53.630 --> 02:34:53.640 align:start position:0%
Keith
 
02:34:56.630 --> 02:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh I have a question for you
 
02:34:59.330 --> 02:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
yep sure am I moving too quick between
 
02:35:02.210 --> 02:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
bills or are you I was able to keep up
 
02:35:05.030 --> 02:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's when we get to exec sessions and
 
02:35:07.429 --> 02:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
there's multiple motions the four the
 
02:35:10.250 --> 02:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
forms they gave me they're not they're
 
02:35:11.690 --> 02:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
not well designed like if they're
 
02:35:14.030 --> 02:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
difficult to to manipulate they're all
 
02:35:16.610 --> 02:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
like Word documents that I have to okay
 
02:35:19.370 --> 02:35:19.380 align:start position:0%
keep track of so yeah but I was okay
 
02:35:21.110 --> 02:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
this morning all right great I was a
 
02:35:22.490 --> 02:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
little I'm just kind of dawned on me
 
02:35:25.250 --> 02:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
that I was next week yeah thanks for
 
02:35:30.650 --> 02:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:30.660 --> 02:35:32.330 align:start position:0%
 
because

02:35:32.330 --> 02:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:12:08.330 --> 04:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:08.340 --> 04:12:15.769 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:12:15.769 --> 04:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:19.849 --> 04:12:19.859 align:start position:0%
no it's not beer it's it's cream soda
 
04:12:53.469 --> 04:12:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:55.490 --> 04:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
you know what's really tough for all you
 
04:12:59.150 --> 04:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
newbies is that so often we get meetings
 
04:13:03.950 --> 04:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
and lunch provided during committee days
 
04:13:06.650 --> 04:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
um we'll have lunch in the
 
04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
um at the Apple Walker house sometimes
 
04:13:08.880 --> 04:13:10.189 align:start position:0%
um at the Apple Walker house sometimes
they're

04:13:10.189 --> 04:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:13:11.809 --> 04:13:11.819 align:start position:0%
um they'll bring them into the cafeteria
 
04:13:14.990 --> 04:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
the lobbyists like to talk to us and one
 
04:13:16.969 --> 04:13:16.979 align:start position:0%
of the ways they get us to show up is to
 
04:13:18.229 --> 04:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
feed us
 
04:13:20.330 --> 04:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times you know we have
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
really sharp schedules so
 
04:13:26.809 --> 04:13:26.819 align:start position:0%
it works out well we don't have to go to
 
04:13:29.570 --> 04:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
a restaurant or go across the street
 
04:13:32.090 --> 04:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
um Barley House is a favorite of some of
 
04:13:32.100 --> 04:13:32.929 align:start position:0%
um Barley House is a favorite of some of
us

04:13:32.929 --> 04:13:32.939 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:13:32.939 --> 04:13:34.490 align:start position:0%
us
but

04:13:34.490 --> 04:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:13:37.670 --> 04:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
um when they feed us we feel you know
 
04:13:40.070 --> 04:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
like we listen to them we get lunch and
 
04:13:40.969 --> 04:13:40.979 align:start position:0%
then we can get right back into
 
04:13:43.189 --> 04:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
committee on time this year that's not
 
04:13:46.309 --> 04:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
happening so having I'm eating a lot of
 
04:13:48.050 --> 04:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
peanut butter and jelly looking forward
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:59.150 --> 04:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
that's true I miss that Christy
 
04:14:01.250 --> 04:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
I couldn't miss the camaraderie of all
 
04:14:03.170 --> 04:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
being around together yeah you know and
 
04:14:05.630 --> 04:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
and just getting written testimony
 
04:14:08.090 --> 04:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
really isn't the same as when you're
 
04:14:11.090 --> 04:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
talking face to face to you know
 
04:14:13.070 --> 04:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
somebody who's representing
 
04:14:15.889 --> 04:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
um somebody that's on a bill and you
 
04:14:17.269 --> 04:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
know for all the bad rap that a

it certainly saves wear and tear on our
 
04:15:27.600 --> 04:15:32.830 align:start position:0%
it certainly saves wear and tear on our
vehicles

04:15:32.830 --> 04:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:39.550 --> 04:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:42.530 --> 04:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
I know
 
04:15:48.189 --> 04:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:51.710 --> 04:15:51.720 align:start position:0%

all always have a second one it just
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
went away it went away yeah uh I uh I
 
04:16:07.370 --> 04:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
only put on like 5 000 miles not 50. on
 
04:16:09.790 --> 04:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
my vehicle last year uh amazing
 
04:16:13.010 --> 04:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
theoretically the vehicle will last 10
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
years longer well be sure be sure to
 
04:16:19.010 --> 04:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
tell your insurance agent maybe with a a
 
04:16:22.010 --> 04:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
carrier that gives you a different rate
 
04:16:23.750 --> 04:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
for low mileage
 
04:16:28.490 --> 04:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:33.830 --> 04:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:33.840 --> 04:16:34.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:37.010 --> 04:16:37.020 align:start position:0%
I always we've been in the car business
 
04:16:39.710 --> 04:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
forever and ever so I only carry a
 
04:16:43.490 --> 04:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
liability if the car gets smashed up uh
 
04:16:45.429 --> 04:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
we've got more so
 
04:16:49.969 --> 04:16:49.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:52.250 --> 04:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
a Manchester's territory one they're the
 
04:16:54.830 --> 04:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
most expensive in the state
 
04:16:59.809 --> 04:16:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
okay uh I guess it's 115 or 117. what
 
04:17:07.130 --> 04:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
time to go into exact session so uh

uh relative to continue in-network
 
04:17:29.030 --> 04:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
access to certain health care providers
 
04:17:29.040 --> 04:17:30.469 align:start position:0%
access to certain health care providers
uh

04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:17:32.269 --> 04:17:32.279 align:start position:0%
representative greenson seconded by
 
04:17:34.729 --> 04:17:34.739 align:start position:0%
representative petusic moves in
 
04:17:36.950 --> 04:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and
 
04:17:38.870 --> 04:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative greeson is recognized to
 
04:17:41.630 --> 04:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
speak to his motion
 
04:17:43.429 --> 04:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:17:46.849 --> 04:17:46.859 align:start position:0%
um chairman uh sorry chairman one of
 
04:17:48.290 --> 04:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
these days we'll get you there sorry
 
04:17:52.070 --> 04:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:54.229 --> 04:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh let me uh let me open up the document
 
04:17:55.910 --> 04:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
I had the wrong one open here so here we
 
04:17:59.990 --> 04:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
go uh so the uh House Bill 62 FN is
 
04:18:01.729 --> 04:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
relative to continue to network access
 
04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
to certain Healthcare Providers the
 
04:18:06.410 --> 04:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill uh is to require
 
04:18:10.370 --> 04:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
access by a covered person to a provider
 
04:18:13.670 --> 04:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
in the insurance Network directory at
 
04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
in-network rates for the duration of the
 
04:18:19.330 --> 04:18:19.340 align:start position:0%
contract for health care services
 
04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh in in listening to the testimony and
 
04:18:23.040 --> 04:18:24.710 align:start position:0%
uh in in listening to the testimony and
uh

04:18:24.710 --> 04:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:18:26.450 --> 04:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
determining that it would be in
 
04:18:28.670 --> 04:18:28.680 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate because there's
 
04:18:31.729 --> 04:18:31.739 align:start position:0%
already 60 days of continued coverage in
 
04:18:33.710 --> 04:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
law for patients and carriers to find
 
04:18:36.290 --> 04:18:36.300 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and this bill would be
 
04:18:37.790 --> 04:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult to implement
 
04:18:40.969 --> 04:18:40.979 align:start position:0%
considering that uh plans and provider
 
04:18:42.710 --> 04:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
contracts start at various times
 
04:18:44.510 --> 04:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the year and they're not all
 
04:18:46.429 --> 04:18:46.439 align:start position:0%
synchronized to be any one time during
 
04:18:50.210 --> 04:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
the year so given those two reasons uh
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's determined in expedient to
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
legislate that's all I have sir
 
04:18:54.359 --> 04:18:55.630 align:start position:0%
legislate that's all I have sir
okay

04:18:55.630 --> 04:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:19:00.170 --> 04:19:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:01.969 --> 04:19:01.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:19:01.979 --> 04:19:02.750 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

04:19:02.750 --> 04:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:04.729 --> 04:19:04.739 align:start position:0%
we feel a little differently because of
 
04:19:07.030 --> 04:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was provided by
 
04:19:09.710 --> 04:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh we'd like to retain
 
04:19:11.929 --> 04:19:11.939 align:start position:0%
this and work on the amendment
 
04:19:13.809 --> 04:19:13.819 align:start position:0%
um to try to
 
04:19:16.969 --> 04:19:16.979 align:start position:0%
coordinate the dates that was brought up
 
04:19:23.150 --> 04:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the amendment ended up
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
saying that the that the company had to
 
04:19:31.150 --> 04:19:31.160 align:start position:0%
the insurance company had to uh
 
04:19:35.450 --> 04:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
ex honor that previous contract and give
 
04:19:38.389 --> 04:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
attention to that for that one patient
 
04:19:41.809 --> 04:19:41.819 align:start position:0%
or whatever patient or that provider and
 
04:19:43.729 --> 04:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem
 
04:19:47.090 --> 04:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
very fair does it
 
04:19:49.189 --> 04:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
well my feeling is that this bill could
 
04:19:52.250 --> 04:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
be worked on um to meet the intent
 
04:19:55.610 --> 04:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:55.620 --> 04:19:57.410 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:19:57.410 --> 04:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:19:59.630 --> 04:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
that's your feeling
 
04:20:01.969 --> 04:20:01.979 align:start position:0%
okay any more discussion on the motion

04:21:47.809 --> 04:21:47.819 align:start position:0%
available motion to you
 
04:21:50.570 --> 04:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
I understand but we would have to
 
04:21:50.580 --> 04:21:51.650 align:start position:0%
I understand but we would have to
um

04:21:51.650 --> 04:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:53.809 --> 04:21:53.819 align:start position:0%
that would be the Minority Report would
 
04:21:55.070 --> 04:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
be OTP
 
04:21:57.710 --> 04:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
can we bring up the possibility of an
 
04:22:03.410 --> 04:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:07.130 --> 04:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:07.140 --> 04:22:11.229 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:22:11.229 --> 04:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:13.130 --> 04:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
he'll be back
 
04:22:15.550 --> 04:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sure
 
04:22:19.370 --> 04:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
who will be running the Minority Report
 
04:22:20.689 --> 04:22:20.699 align:start position:0%
um Joyce do you have thoughts about that
 
04:22:24.469 --> 04:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
or do you want me to you're a co-sponsor
 
04:22:27.710 --> 04:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
you're muted I'll do the Minority Report
 
04:22:34.550 --> 04:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
you'll do it okay okay thank you
 
04:22:37.849 --> 04:22:37.859 align:start position:0%
oh we have to get um
 
04:22:39.290 --> 04:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
the chair will be back in a minute I'm
 
04:22:41.870 --> 04:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
sure you just got frozen and um I did
 
04:22:43.610 --> 04:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
want to ask whether we can bring up the
 
04:22:45.889 --> 04:22:45.899 align:start position:0%
possibility of an amendment
 
04:22:49.130 --> 04:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
um that that might have uh made the bill
 
04:22:49.140 --> 04:22:50.090 align:start position:0%
um that that might have uh made the bill
um

04:22:50.090 --> 04:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:50.100 --> 04:22:53.809 align:start position:0%
um
workable

04:22:53.809 --> 04:22:53.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:56.070 --> 04:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
I take the silence to be a yes
 
04:22:56.080 --> 04:22:58.490 align:start position:0%
I take the silence to be a yes
[Laughter]

04:22:58.490 --> 04:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:23:01.550 --> 04:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sure he's running alongside there
 
04:23:03.410 --> 04:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
he'll be here
 
04:23:05.210 --> 04:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why you can't put it
 
04:23:08.410 --> 04:23:08.420 align:start position:0%
a recommendation in The Minority Report
 
04:23:11.330 --> 04:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
so then the Minority Report would be
 
04:23:13.010 --> 04:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended you're saying
 
04:23:14.870 --> 04:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
but if that's correct want to do that
 
04:23:17.809 --> 04:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
then you need to you know include the
 
04:23:20.809 --> 04:23:20.819 align:start position:0%
text of the amendment in the calendar
 
04:23:20.819 --> 04:23:23.030 align:start position:0%
text of the amendment in the calendar
oh

04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:23:25.150 --> 04:23:25.160 align:start position:0%
so you couldn't just have a
 
04:23:27.530 --> 04:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
prospective Amendment you need you need
 
04:23:30.590 --> 04:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
it and now it wasn't um
 
04:23:33.050 --> 04:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
it was only distributed to us it's not
 
04:23:33.060 --> 04:23:34.610 align:start position:0%
it was only distributed to us it's not
in

04:23:34.610 --> 04:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:23:37.010 --> 04:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
oh no if you want to use
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
um the the amendment you have in hand
 
04:23:41.269 --> 04:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
that's fine it's okay to be a formally
 
04:23:43.010 --> 04:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
drafted Amendment you know I was
 
04:23:44.630 --> 04:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
thinking you were saying
 
04:23:48.110 --> 04:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
you wanted to have you know a concept of
 
04:23:49.729 --> 04:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
a future Amendment with without them
 
04:23:51.950 --> 04:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
okay no it is a formally drafted
 
04:23:53.750 --> 04:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment oh that's fine then you could
 
04:23:55.370 --> 04:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
have a Minority Report about to pass
 
04:23:57.469 --> 04:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
this amended okay I'm sure the chairman
 
04:23:59.750 --> 04:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
would agree with me now looking back now
 
04:24:01.969 --> 04:24:01.979 align:start position:0%
the chair's back yeah
 
04:24:03.889 --> 04:24:03.899 align:start position:0%
and he froze again
 
04:24:12.429 --> 04:24:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:16.070 --> 04:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
LLB air is this Pam
 
04:24:16.080 --> 04:24:17.389 align:start position:0%
LLB air is this Pam
good

04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:24:19.910 --> 04:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
could I question the council
 
04:24:23.210 --> 04:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
that was given please anybody hear me
 
04:24:27.170 --> 04:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
yeah we hear you for the Minority Report
 
04:24:30.349 --> 04:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
um you know words uh one little word can
 
04:24:32.030 --> 04:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
mean a lot I think
 
04:24:34.010 --> 04:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
that what you would want to say is ought
 
04:24:36.889 --> 04:24:36.899 align:start position:0%
to ought to pass if amended but not as
 
04:24:39.050 --> 04:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
amended because as amended assumes that
 
04:24:40.490 --> 04:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
it's been amended and it hasn't been
 
04:24:42.710 --> 04:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
amended so I would suggest you say ought
 
04:24:44.889 --> 04:24:44.899 align:start position:0%
to pass if amended
 
04:24:47.750 --> 04:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
so Pam as long as the amendment is
 
04:24:49.910 --> 04:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
published in the calendar
 
04:24:52.670 --> 04:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
yes if you have if you uh that's
 
04:24:55.490 --> 04:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
certainly an appropriate motion to have
 
04:24:57.229 --> 04:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
for your minority Amendment an
 
04:24:59.330 --> 04:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
unfortunately representative Terry we
 
04:24:59.340 --> 04:25:00.170 align:start position:0%
unfortunately representative Terry we
just

04:25:00.170 --> 04:25:00.180 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:25:03.110 --> 04:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
the words we use are as amended you're
 
04:25:05.389 --> 04:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
correct it's not a past tense but but
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the motion it is
 
04:25:11.689 --> 04:25:11.699 align:start position:0%
misleading I I your point is taken and
 
04:25:13.670 --> 04:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
and that's not what it means
 
04:25:13.680 --> 04:25:16.010 align:start position:0%
and that's not what it means
well

04:25:16.010 --> 04:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:25:18.309 --> 04:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
there's nothing perfect
 
04:25:20.689 --> 04:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
my goodness
 
04:25:23.030 --> 04:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's a word of Art
 
04:25:24.830 --> 04:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
Pam that wouldn't be a floor Amendment
 
04:25:26.630 --> 04:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
then it would just be an assumption that
 
04:25:28.550 --> 04:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment is already appended to the
 
04:25:30.290 --> 04:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
actual bill correct
 
04:25:33.650 --> 04:25:33.660 align:start position:0%
right it would be a minority committee
 
04:25:35.450 --> 04:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
Amendment that's how it would be listed
 
04:25:37.309 --> 04:25:37.319 align:start position:0%
in the the
 
04:25:39.530 --> 04:25:39.540 align:start position:0%
minority Amendment would be in the
 
04:25:42.349 --> 04:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
calendar okay everybody should take note
 
04:25:44.950 --> 04:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
of the new phrase
 
04:25:49.130 --> 04:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh as a result of the pandemic the chair
 
04:25:52.370 --> 04:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:56.750 --> 04:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
and there he is here he is he's back

it will be published in the calendar
 
04:30:17.870 --> 04:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
okay and I'm just want to make sure I
 
04:30:19.809 --> 04:30:19.819 align:start position:0%
understand it all that's why I'm asking
 
04:30:21.830 --> 04:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
repetition's an important teacher for
 
04:30:24.349 --> 04:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
most of us yeah hearing it more than
 
04:30:27.229 --> 04:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
once has helped exactly especially
 
04:30:28.670 --> 04:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative and representative
 
04:30:31.149 --> 04:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
Marsha's position is what
 
04:30:33.590 --> 04:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh is the sponsor of
 
04:30:36.710 --> 04:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
this bill is he a parliamentarian
 
04:30:39.889 --> 04:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
what you see a parliamentarian he just
 
04:30:41.450 --> 04:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
spoke authoritatively about what could
 
04:30:43.070 --> 04:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
be done and I'm just wondering on what
 
04:30:46.370 --> 04:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
basis he's doing that experience ah
 
04:30:49.610 --> 04:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
experience he has been in the house a
 
04:30:53.870 --> 04:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:56.349 --> 04:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
Christy our representative Bartlett yes
 
04:30:59.809 --> 04:30:59.819 align:start position:0%
you made a motion uh to retain
 
04:31:02.950 --> 04:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
um no I know well you did mention
 
04:31:05.809 --> 04:31:05.819 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill right I can't make
 
04:31:08.149 --> 04:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
the motion to retain because there was
 
04:31:10.570 --> 04:31:10.580 align:start position:0%
the motion on the floor was itl
 
04:31:13.130 --> 04:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
right so
 
04:31:15.410 --> 04:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
um we in The Minority Report you did
 
04:31:18.110 --> 04:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
talk about retaining the bill I didn't
 
04:31:19.670 --> 04:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
hear ought to pass
 
04:31:21.710 --> 04:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
but it is automatically ought to pass
 
04:31:24.050 --> 04:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
the other side Autumn pass was Amendment
 
04:31:25.670 --> 04:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
because we have an amendment that was
 
04:31:27.769 --> 04:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
that went through OLS and was
 
04:31:29.929 --> 04:31:29.939 align:start position:0%
distributed to all of us that will be
 
04:31:32.570 --> 04:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
published in the calendar
 
04:31:35.269 --> 04:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
and on The Minority Report will refer to
 
04:31:41.349 --> 04:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:43.910 --> 04:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's complicated
 
04:31:45.950 --> 04:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily make any you know
 
04:31:46.849 --> 04:31:46.859 align:start position:0%
it's not going to make any difference
 
04:31:50.510 --> 04:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
the prevailing recommendation from the
 
04:31:53.689 --> 04:31:53.699 align:start position:0%
committee on the in the calendar will be
 
04:31:53.699 --> 04:31:55.729 align:start position:0%
committee on the in the calendar will be
itl

04:31:55.729 --> 04:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
itl
 
04:32:00.050 --> 04:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
okay chair is unfrozen I have uh had to
 
04:32:04.090 --> 04:32:04.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:06.889 --> 04:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
and that's not me okay so I had to
 
04:32:10.490 --> 04:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
reboot everything so uh and so uh uh
 
04:32:12.530 --> 04:32:12.540 align:start position:0%

04:32:14.990 --> 04:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
down in you know closer to my uh
 
04:32:16.910 --> 04:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
internet in which I do have two dogs
 
04:32:19.490 --> 04:32:19.500 align:start position:0%

prior authorizations under Managed Care
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
health benefit plans and the
 
04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
administration of patient transfers to
 
04:33:39.590 --> 04:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
another health facility
 
04:33:43.429 --> 04:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh this deal had more people
 
04:33:47.209 --> 04:33:47.219 align:start position:0%
uh for and against and
 
04:33:49.970 --> 04:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks
 
04:33:53.769 --> 04:33:53.779 align:start position:0%
said that it needs further study
 
04:33:58.070 --> 04:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh it really uh could be burdensome if
 
04:34:01.131 --> 04:34:01.141 align:start position:0%
it's not done correctly so that is the
 
04:34:03.769 --> 04:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
one of the main reasons why I move to
 
04:34:06.890 --> 04:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
retain it because there is more work to
 
04:34:10.369 --> 04:34:10.379 align:start position:0%
be done on this bill and I've had folks
 
04:34:14.869 --> 04:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
contact me uh saying the same thing and
 
04:34:17.209 --> 04:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
the same folks that uh
 
04:34:20.150 --> 04:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh testified and they would be willing
 
04:34:24.170 --> 04:34:24.180 align:start position:0%
to work on it with us so that is why I
 
04:34:28.369 --> 04:34:28.379 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:30.230 --> 04:34:30.240 align:start position:0%

yay the first unanimous vote Mr chairman
 
04:36:05.510 --> 04:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
can I just interject very quickly while

you were gone there was a discussion
 
04:36:11.150 --> 04:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
about the the phrasing of the motion and
 
04:36:13.849 --> 04:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
I want to correct what I said
 
04:36:15.949 --> 04:36:15.959 align:start position:0%
um representative Terry mentioned that
 
04:36:17.869 --> 04:36:17.879 align:start position:0%
it should not be ought to pass as
 
04:36:20.929 --> 04:36:20.939 align:start position:0%
amended and he was correct and and and
 
04:36:23.570 --> 04:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
it really is ought to pass with
 
04:36:26.390 --> 04:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment and the timing is
 
04:36:26.400 --> 04:36:27.289 align:start position:0%
Amendment and the timing is
um

04:36:27.289 --> 04:36:27.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:31.310 --> 04:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
is left up in the air undesignated so
 
04:36:34.970 --> 04:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
that that is so if it if that motion
 
04:36:36.410 --> 04:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
prevailed then the amendment would then
 
04:36:39.051 --> 04:36:39.061 align:start position:0%
get taken up right
 
04:36:42.051 --> 04:36:42.061 align:start position:0%
yeah if the if the motion uh to uh to
 
04:36:44.929 --> 04:36:44.939 align:start position:0%
inexperienced fails then you would then
 
04:36:47.269 --> 04:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
offer up the with them you know we offer
 
04:36:49.510 --> 04:36:49.520 align:start position:0%

um this was something that went through
 
04:37:48.890 --> 04:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
the labor committee last term was passed
 
04:37:48.900 --> 04:37:50.689 align:start position:0%
the labor committee last term was passed
unanimously

04:37:50.689 --> 04:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
unanimously
 
04:37:50.699 --> 04:37:51.349 align:start position:0%
unanimously
um

04:37:51.349 --> 04:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:52.970 --> 04:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
it was only because it was attached to
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
the Omnibus bills and this is really
 
04:37:56.990 --> 04:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
restrained trade
 
04:37:59.689 --> 04:37:59.699 align:start position:0%
um matters so I'm I'm
 
04:38:01.970 --> 04:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
surprised that
 
04:38:05.209 --> 04:38:05.219 align:start position:0%
your side is looking to kill this
 
04:38:07.970 --> 04:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
because it's not usually a position that
 
04:38:10.490 --> 04:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
um your side would take
 
04:38:12.769 --> 04:38:12.779 align:start position:0%
um well if you were to look at the
 
04:38:14.709 --> 04:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
legislative history of the two other
 
04:38:17.449 --> 04:38:17.459 align:start position:0%
non-compete bills
 
04:38:20.810 --> 04:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
uh the first one was Physicians
 
04:38:23.990 --> 04:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
and the vote was 17-1
 
04:38:26.209 --> 04:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
and I think I know who that one person
 
04:38:26.219 --> 04:38:29.631 align:start position:0%
and I think I know who that one person
was

04:38:29.631 --> 04:38:29.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:32.029 --> 04:38:32.039 align:start position:0%
second one second time it came through
 
04:38:35.689 --> 04:38:35.699 align:start position:0%
Commerce the vote was a split vote and
 
04:38:39.410 --> 04:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:42.310 --> 04:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
so this time we have it one more time
 
04:38:46.189 --> 04:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
and at this time the committee was the
 
04:38:50.029 --> 04:38:50.039 align:start position:0%
Republicans evidently we feel that um
 
04:38:52.369 --> 04:38:52.379 align:start position:0%
this we got to draw the line and stop it
 
04:38:55.070 --> 04:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
and frankly if I had my way
 
04:38:58.131 --> 04:38:58.141 align:start position:0%
I would keep the bill and repeal the
 
04:39:00.650 --> 04:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
other two because I think I think that
 
04:39:03.230 --> 04:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
anybody who signs a non you know
 
04:39:06.730 --> 04:39:06.740 align:start position:0%
non-compete Clause is getting some
 
04:39:09.830 --> 04:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
remuneration or benefit
 
04:39:12.650 --> 04:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
for that being put in the contract
 
04:39:14.269 --> 04:39:14.279 align:start position:0%
we do that or they just didn't read the
 
04:39:16.730 --> 04:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
contract at all so the fact that we're
 
04:39:17.869 --> 04:39:17.879 align:start position:0%
going to get in the middle of a
 
04:39:20.090 --> 04:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
contractual arrangement
 
04:39:22.670 --> 04:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
and which we don't know the compensation
 
04:39:24.170 --> 04:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
we don't know whether there was a free
 
04:39:26.269 --> 04:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
parking space involved in there we don't
 
04:39:29.090 --> 04:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
know what was the benefit for why it was
 
04:39:31.010 --> 04:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
put in the contract
 
04:39:32.929 --> 04:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
and so therefore that's why we feel that
 
04:39:35.929 --> 04:39:35.939 align:start position:0%
this bill is inappropriate
 
04:39:38.390 --> 04:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
okay well I will um
 
04:39:40.610 --> 04:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
I will have to oppose it and I do I I
 
04:39:43.310 --> 04:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
see it as Restraint of trade and I you
 
04:39:44.510 --> 04:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
know come from an insurance background
 
04:39:46.788 --> 04:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
and certainly there's not competes in
 
04:39:48.350 --> 04:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
insurance but we had some very
 
04:39:50.530 --> 04:39:50.540 align:start position:0%
compelling testimony I think
 
04:39:53.990 --> 04:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
that um so have you ever put in a bill
 
04:39:58.368 --> 04:39:58.378 align:start position:0%
to Vanquish those non-competes
 
04:39:59.868 --> 04:39:59.878 align:start position:0%
so I'm not
 
04:40:01.550 --> 04:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
painting this with a broad brush but I
 
04:40:04.368 --> 04:40:04.378 align:start position:0%
am saying that um we would oppose your
 
04:40:06.730 --> 04:40:06.740 align:start position:0%
motion I fully appreciate that
 
04:40:11.090 --> 04:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
dude so I actually did think also that
 
04:40:16.788 --> 04:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
there was some uh salvageable value to
 
04:40:19.368 --> 04:40:19.378 align:start position:0%
the bill but it would have really opened
 
04:40:21.050 --> 04:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
up it's almost like the work we would
 
04:40:24.110 --> 04:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
have for uh for a a study committee or a
 
04:40:25.670 --> 04:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
task force
 
04:40:27.350 --> 04:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
um that there's there's so many issues
 
04:40:27.360 --> 04:40:28.490 align:start position:0%
um that there's there's so many issues
there

04:40:28.490 --> 04:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:40:30.170 --> 04:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
um so I decided that
 
04:40:32.750 --> 04:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
what some members said they wanted to do
 
04:40:34.970 --> 04:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
with the bill with this bill it would be
 
04:40:36.530 --> 04:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
better off just introducing a new bill
 
04:40:38.030 --> 04:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
next year
 
04:40:41.750 --> 04:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm voting to just itl this and then
 
04:40:43.010 --> 04:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
hopefully someone will come up with
 
04:40:44.750 --> 04:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
something uh
 
04:40:49.430 --> 04:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:51.708 --> 04:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
somebody has music in the background
 
04:40:53.990 --> 04:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay any more discussion on the motion

representative batusic moves to retain
 
04:42:54.170 --> 04:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on that motion
 
04:42:54.180 --> 04:42:57.590 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on that motion
yo

04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:01.430 --> 04:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I made the motion I'll say
 
04:43:03.010 --> 04:43:03.020 align:start position:0%
something Mr chairman yes you are
 
04:43:04.970 --> 04:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak to your motion thank
 
04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:07.680 --> 04:43:09.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:43:09.890 --> 04:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:12.410 --> 04:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
this was a very uh interesting uh bill
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
and we heard uh very interesting uh
 
04:43:18.770 --> 04:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
testimony on both uh sides of the uh of
 
04:43:20.810 --> 04:43:20.820 align:start position:0%
the question
 
04:43:24.890 --> 04:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
um it uh kind of got the feel of a David
 
04:43:29.090 --> 04:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
versus Goliath uh situation where of
 
04:43:30.650 --> 04:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
course the Goliath would be the
 
04:43:32.208 --> 04:43:32.218 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
04:43:35.510 --> 04:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
which um for for many of us would would
 
04:43:37.690 --> 04:43:37.700 align:start position:0%
mean that we don't have a great deal of
 
04:43:41.708 --> 04:43:41.718 align:start position:0%
sympathy uh preliminarily
 
04:43:44.350 --> 04:43:44.360 align:start position:0%
however I think the most compelling
 
04:43:47.708 --> 04:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
reason to retain here is because
 
04:43:50.750 --> 04:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the time frame of the clawback
 
04:43:54.288 --> 04:43:54.298 align:start position:0%
was only most recently reduced from 18
 
04:43:56.448 --> 04:43:56.458 align:start position:0%
months to one year and as I understand
 
04:44:00.410 --> 04:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
it last year was the first full year of
 
04:44:04.190 --> 04:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
the one year maximum so I need to give
 
04:44:06.530 --> 04:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
this a little bit more time and see how
 
04:44:10.190 --> 04:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
things develop and so I recommend that
 
04:44:13.190 --> 04:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
we um that we retain
 
04:44:16.670 --> 04:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
okay representative van helden
 
04:44:19.010 --> 04:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you to
 
04:44:20.690 --> 04:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
the rest of the committee I think retain
 
04:44:22.730 --> 04:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
is probably the best uh the best option
 
04:44:25.250 --> 04:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
right now there is a great deal going on
 
04:44:27.230 --> 04:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
with this build we do have bipartisan
 
04:44:29.090 --> 04:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
support we have support across the
 
04:44:31.550 --> 04:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
bodies of the legislature so there's an
 
04:44:33.170 --> 04:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
obvious interest I think in getting this
 
04:44:35.208 --> 04:44:35.218 align:start position:0%
right and making it work so I think the
 
04:44:37.250 --> 04:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
routine is probably the best thing I
 
04:44:39.288 --> 04:44:39.298 align:start position:0%
know that we have many constituents and
 
04:44:41.330 --> 04:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
many followers of the bill who are very
 
04:44:43.310 --> 04:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
willing to support the retain and to
 
04:44:45.110 --> 04:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
help us to craft the best Bill possible
 
04:44:47.690 --> 04:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
I pledge my support there as well thank
 
04:44:47.700 --> 04:44:49.910 align:start position:0%
I pledge my support there as well thank
you

04:44:49.910 --> 04:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:52.128 --> 04:44:52.138 align:start position:0%
well yeah I just would have to say that
 
04:44:55.010 --> 04:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm not happy about this motion
 
04:44:57.890 --> 04:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
but I am I'm agreeable to it because I
 
04:45:00.470 --> 04:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
certainly think that there needs to be a
 
04:45:03.288 --> 04:45:03.298 align:start position:0%
lot more explanation I find that half
 
04:45:05.690 --> 04:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
the phone calls and I take all my calls
 
04:45:08.150 --> 04:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
half the people who called actually
 
04:45:10.128 --> 04:45:10.138 align:start position:0%
admitted Aid and never happened to them
 
04:45:13.070 --> 04:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
and B it didn't actually cover them and
 
04:45:14.628 --> 04:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
who their clients were
 
04:45:17.390 --> 04:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
okay 18 months is a standard number
 
04:45:21.170 --> 04:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
across the board for all carriers when
 
04:45:22.550 --> 04:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
it comes to
 
04:45:24.410 --> 04:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
all other Physicians and all other
 
04:45:27.708 --> 04:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
practices okay it's is standard and it
 
04:45:29.708 --> 04:45:29.718 align:start position:0%
turns out that the the biggest problem
 
04:45:34.250 --> 04:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
was a Medicare Advantage
 
04:45:36.470 --> 04:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
which of course we don't cover we don't
 
04:45:38.510 --> 04:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
our legislation doesn't affect it our
 
04:45:40.250 --> 04:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
legislation doesn't affect orisa plans
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
and self-insured plans so and all of
 
04:45:45.530 --> 04:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
those are still at the 18 months and so
 
04:45:47.930 --> 04:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
that's what what happens is that a lot
 
04:45:49.610 --> 04:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
of people are very confused or these
 
04:45:51.708 --> 04:45:51.718 align:start position:0%
providers are confused when they see
 
04:45:53.390 --> 04:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
this legislation they want to hop on it
 
04:45:55.310 --> 04:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
but don't realize that they're really
 
04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
actually going to only make themselves
 
04:45:58.610 --> 04:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
even more miserable because when they
 
04:46:02.030 --> 04:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
find out that yes that they did it for
 
04:46:04.128 --> 04:46:04.138 align:start position:0%
you know they didn't didn't actually
 
04:46:09.650 --> 04:46:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:11.448 --> 04:46:11.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:46:13.448 --> 04:46:13.458 align:start position:0%
um would you just
 
04:46:16.250 --> 04:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
re review with us
 
04:46:19.788 --> 04:46:19.798 align:start position:0%
the time frame of when um our reports
 
04:46:21.770 --> 04:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
would need to be out
 
04:46:23.930 --> 04:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
for retained bills so because we know
 
04:46:25.368 --> 04:46:25.378 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a number of retained
 
04:46:28.010 --> 04:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
bills can you give us a um just a
 
04:46:30.890 --> 04:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
refresher on where our commitments would
 
04:46:34.070 --> 04:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
be when the committee would meet yeah so
 
04:46:37.310 --> 04:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
my my plan would is between uh retain
 
04:46:39.708 --> 04:46:39.718 align:start position:0%
bills much like we do with interim study
 
04:46:42.050 --> 04:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
bills in the second year which is that
 
04:46:44.150 --> 04:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh we would take him up in the fall so
 
04:46:46.910 --> 04:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
starting in September and October uh we
 
04:46:48.170 --> 04:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
have two months to work on all the
 
04:46:50.930 --> 04:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
retained bills and that uh by the end of
 
04:46:50.940 --> 04:46:52.310 align:start position:0%
retained bills and that uh by the end of
October

04:46:52.310 --> 04:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
October
 
04:46:53.930 --> 04:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
um I believe is the the date where we
 
04:46:55.850 --> 04:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
have to have all retained bills out of
 
04:46:57.470 --> 04:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
committee and they would hit the house
 
04:46:59.090 --> 04:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
floor uh the first week of January
 
04:47:01.490 --> 04:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you I missed that first
 
04:47:03.830 --> 04:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
week of January keep reminding Ed that
 
04:47:05.050 --> 04:47:05.060 align:start position:0%
when you
 
04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
but that first week of January is all
 
04:47:09.650 --> 04:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
the all the hard ones that got retained
 
04:47:18.110 --> 04:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:20.448 --> 04:47:20.458 align:start position:0%
represent Van Houten
 
04:47:22.430 --> 04:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you Mr chair I want to
 
04:47:23.868 --> 04:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments and for your
 
04:47:27.230 --> 04:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
insights and I assure you that um that
 
04:47:28.788 --> 04:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
there are issues that go beyond that
 
04:47:31.070 --> 04:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
that there are practitioners who have
 
04:47:33.288 --> 04:47:33.298 align:start position:0%
lost money a year a year and a half two
 
04:47:35.510 --> 04:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
years later who if and the word clawback
 
04:47:38.510 --> 04:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
I think is so negatively connotative so
 
04:47:41.330 --> 04:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
it is my it is my intent and my hope to
 
04:47:43.190 --> 04:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
craft a bill and to actually to help
 
04:47:45.170 --> 04:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
with the retained Bill to take care of
 
04:47:46.610 --> 04:47:46.620 align:start position:0%
those issues and to make sure that
 
04:47:48.288 --> 04:47:48.298 align:start position:0%
nobody is harmed on this not the
 
04:47:49.610 --> 04:47:49.620 align:start position:0%
insurance companies not the
 
04:47:51.288 --> 04:47:51.298 align:start position:0%
practitioners and certainly not our
 
04:47:54.350 --> 04:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
constituents uh as we find that mental
 
04:47:55.970 --> 04:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
mental health practitioners are starting
 
04:47:58.430 --> 04:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
to not take insurance because of these
 
04:48:01.190 --> 04:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
kinds of issues we have a pandemic that
 
04:48:03.350 --> 04:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
has caused many mental health issues for
 
04:48:05.750 --> 04:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
people and there are many facets to this
 
04:48:07.788 --> 04:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm happy for your thoughts I'm
 
04:48:10.128 --> 04:48:10.138 align:start position:0%
happy for your willingness to to give
 
04:48:12.110 --> 04:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
this a chance and I hope that you'll
 
04:48:13.490 --> 04:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
stay open-minded so that I could
 
04:48:15.770 --> 04:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
convince you that my way is the right
 
04:48:15.780 --> 04:48:16.810 align:start position:0%
convince you that my way is the right
way

04:48:16.810 --> 04:48:16.820 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:48:20.090 --> 04:48:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:22.850 --> 04:48:22.860 align:start position:0%

and I will speak to my motion
 
04:53:07.550 --> 04:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
um I realize uh Christy we have that
 
04:53:09.590 --> 04:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that you have there but at
 
04:53:11.270 --> 04:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
this point what I what I would want to
 
04:53:12.410 --> 04:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
do is I want to have the insurance
 
04:53:15.288 --> 04:53:15.298 align:start position:0%
department come in in the fall and tell
 
04:53:17.330 --> 04:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
us what's going on and at that point in
 
04:53:19.310 --> 04:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
time we can then do what is appropriate
 
04:53:20.810 --> 04:53:20.820 align:start position:0%
in terms of what are extending the dates
 
04:53:23.150 --> 04:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
and reporting dates but that sounds fine
 
04:53:25.250 --> 04:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
yep you know that way it just it's
 
04:53:27.650 --> 04:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
cleaner to get that and then rather than
 
04:53:29.690 --> 04:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
passing an amendment yeah we're fine
 
04:53:31.190 --> 04:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
with that of course everybody to the
 
04:53:35.330 --> 04:53:35.340 align:start position:0%

to speak to her motion
 
04:55:56.868 --> 04:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:55:58.788 --> 04:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
um I believe this bill should be
 
04:55:58.798 --> 04:56:00.770 align:start position:0%
um I believe this bill should be
retained

04:56:00.770 --> 04:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
retained
 
04:56:04.070 --> 04:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
um I think uh in general the goal of
 
04:56:06.948 --> 04:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
balance billing is is a good goal but
 
04:56:09.708 --> 04:56:09.718 align:start position:0%
there are small uh rural ambulance
 
04:56:09.718 --> 04:56:10.990 align:start position:0%
there are small uh rural ambulance
services

04:56:10.990 --> 04:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:56:14.330 --> 04:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
across uh our state and in the North
 
04:56:18.050 --> 04:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
country that may not have the same
 
04:56:18.060 --> 04:56:20.030 align:start position:0%
country that may not have the same
ability

04:56:20.030 --> 04:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
ability
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
um to negotiate to to advocate for their
 
04:56:27.948 --> 04:56:27.958 align:start position:0%
what they feel is a commercially
 
04:56:32.770 --> 04:56:32.780 align:start position:0%
commercial commercially reasonable rate
 
04:56:37.310 --> 04:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
and so we heard some testimony from the
 
04:56:40.430 --> 04:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
service within my hometown that the
 
04:56:43.010 --> 04:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
goals are great but there's some things
 
04:56:44.570 --> 04:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
in there that they would like a little
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
more time to
 
04:56:47.280 --> 04:56:47.868 align:start position:0%
more time to
um

04:56:47.868 --> 04:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:51.230 --> 04:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
have some input to work with us and
 
04:56:52.868 --> 04:56:52.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps it would be a better
 
04:56:52.878 --> 04:56:54.530 align:start position:0%
perhaps it would be a better
bill

04:56:54.530 --> 04:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:56:54.540 --> 04:56:55.128 align:start position:0%
bill
um

04:56:55.128 --> 04:56:55.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:58.730 --> 04:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
as a result and so I'm I'm asking that
 
04:57:00.650 --> 04:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
if you retain so we can work on it some
 
04:57:03.708 --> 04:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
more here for more rural providers that
 
04:57:06.110 --> 04:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
seem to be affected more than in the
 
04:57:10.430 --> 04:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:12.830 --> 04:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative Weston
 
04:57:14.930 --> 04:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you to
 
04:57:17.628 --> 04:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
the committee it is a complex problem
 
04:57:19.610 --> 04:57:19.620 align:start position:0%
and I think no one knows that better
 
04:57:23.208 --> 04:57:23.218 align:start position:0%
than me I've talked to a number of those
 
04:57:27.288 --> 04:57:27.298 align:start position:0%
uh Fire Chiefs and uh just about
 
04:57:30.288 --> 04:57:30.298 align:start position:0%
everybody who has a stake in this
 
04:57:32.208 --> 04:57:32.218 align:start position:0%
um I disagree with the recommendation of
 
04:57:35.990 --> 04:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
itl because a man a ban on balance
 
04:57:37.970 --> 04:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
billing has been recommended by Tyler
 
04:57:40.368 --> 04:57:40.378 align:start position:0%
Brennan in the New Hampshire insurance
 
04:57:43.128 --> 04:57:43.138 align:start position:0%
department for some time and it's a
 
04:57:46.128 --> 04:57:46.138 align:start position:0%
growing National Trend uh my own
 
04:57:48.590 --> 04:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
ambition for this bill was to solve the
 
04:57:50.810 --> 04:57:50.820 align:start position:0%
problem of ambulance reimbursement rates
 
04:57:53.990 --> 04:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide and to gain more revenue for
 
04:57:55.850 --> 04:57:55.860 align:start position:0%
the property tax poor towns like
 
04:57:59.090 --> 04:57:59.100 align:start position:0%
representative Hamm is talking about
 
04:58:01.670 --> 04:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
um but because of the difficulties of
 
04:58:04.490 --> 04:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
this session I scaled it back to focus
 
04:58:07.730 --> 04:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
on the balance billing for this year but
 
04:58:10.250 --> 04:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
this is like Groundhog Day this bill
 
04:58:12.470 --> 04:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
pops up every year and it'll come back
 
04:58:15.350 --> 04:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
next in the meantime I've been building
 
04:58:17.810 --> 04:58:17.820 align:start position:0%
a coalition of these people who are
 
04:58:20.448 --> 04:58:20.458 align:start position:0%
involved in commercial ambulances fire
 
04:58:22.550 --> 04:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
departments hospitals and everything
 
04:58:26.090 --> 04:58:26.100 align:start position:0%
else in order to really expand a bill
 
04:58:28.850 --> 04:58:28.860 align:start position:0%
that deals with the revenue problem for
 
04:58:31.070 --> 04:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
next year I don't see why we couldn't
 
04:58:33.410 --> 04:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
pass the balance billing thing in the
 
04:58:33.420 --> 04:58:37.250 align:start position:0%
pass the balance billing thing in the
meantime

04:58:37.250 --> 04:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:37.260 --> 04:58:39.010 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:58:39.010 --> 04:58:39.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:58:41.868 --> 04:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
representative Bartlett
 
04:58:43.788 --> 04:58:43.798 align:start position:0%
um I'm confused representative Weston
 
04:58:47.890 --> 04:58:47.900 align:start position:0%
the motion is to retain that to IDL
 
04:58:50.330 --> 04:58:50.340 align:start position:0%
right and the reason I don't want to
 
04:58:52.490 --> 04:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
retain it for this year I want to get
 
04:58:53.810 --> 04:58:53.820 align:start position:0%
rid of
 
04:58:57.288 --> 04:58:57.298 align:start position:0%
I I think we should pass this now I
 
04:58:59.090 --> 04:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
think we ought to pass the balance
 
04:59:01.010 --> 04:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
billing part of this
 
04:59:03.110 --> 04:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
so that people don't get these surprise
 
04:59:05.510 --> 04:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
bills and then next year we'll deal with
 
04:59:07.610 --> 04:59:07.620 align:start position:0%
the with the problem that representative
 
04:59:10.070 --> 04:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
Hamm was addressing about revenue for
 
04:59:13.490 --> 04:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:16.850 --> 04:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
okay so I disagree with the idea with
 
04:59:17.930 --> 04:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
the retain
 
04:59:20.208 --> 04:59:20.218 align:start position:0%
all right so I I if they're all
 
04:59:23.090 --> 04:59:23.100 align:start position:0%
integrated okay that that that
 
04:59:23.100 --> 04:59:24.250 align:start position:0%
integrated okay that that that
um

04:59:24.250 --> 04:59:24.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:27.110 --> 04:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
ambulances are not uh I guess like
 
04:59:28.430 --> 04:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
mental health it's something different
 
04:59:31.490 --> 04:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
it's not the way we normally deal with
 
04:59:34.010 --> 04:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
all our other fee for service uh when it
 
04:59:35.810 --> 04:59:35.820 align:start position:0%
comes to insurance companies paying for
 
04:59:38.510 --> 04:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
medical providers uh you know the mental
 
04:59:40.070 --> 04:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
health is is obviously different because
 
04:59:41.810 --> 04:59:41.820 align:start position:0%
it goes on it can last for a long time
 
04:59:43.730 --> 04:59:43.740 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't have to end date you
 
04:59:45.830 --> 04:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
don't have it easily you're cured you
 
04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
know solution uh and with the ambulance
 
04:59:50.208 --> 04:59:50.218 align:start position:0%
it's an even more awkward situation
 
04:59:52.910 --> 04:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
because the ambulances uh don't get
 
04:59:55.850 --> 04:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for uh equipment for just
 
04:59:58.070 --> 04:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
sitting there you know they're waiting
 
05:00:01.550 --> 05:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
and being there on on in in expectation
 
05:00:03.890 --> 05:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be needed
 
05:00:06.170 --> 05:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
um they can only do fee for service and
 
05:00:06.180 --> 05:00:07.610 align:start position:0%
um they can only do fee for service and
and

05:00:07.610 --> 05:00:07.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:00:09.770 --> 05:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
um they're never going to get frankly
 
05:00:12.410 --> 05:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
never going to get fully reimbursed from
 
05:00:15.110 --> 05:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
an insurance company and if the balance
 
05:00:16.670 --> 05:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
Building Concept is that you're going to
 
05:00:17.810 --> 05:00:17.820 align:start position:0%
get an insurance company to go and I
 
05:00:19.190 --> 05:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
thought it was pretty clear in the
 
05:00:21.230 --> 05:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
hearing that the there were plenty of
 
05:00:22.910 --> 05:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers said it's never
 
05:00:25.730 --> 05:00:25.740 align:start position:0%
going to work because they a they don't
 
05:00:27.230 --> 05:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
want to have a contract they don't want
 
05:00:28.368 --> 05:00:28.378 align:start position:0%
to sign a contract because they don't
 
05:00:29.570 --> 05:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
want to take them easily amounts of
 
05:00:31.190 --> 05:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
money the insurance company is going to
 
05:00:34.368 --> 05:00:34.378 align:start position:0%
be willing to pay and uh that that is
 
05:00:36.890 --> 05:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
never and then so why we have the
 
05:00:40.070 --> 05:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
balance building exists is because the
 
05:00:42.170 --> 05:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
some fire departments really do want it
 
05:00:43.910 --> 05:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
they want the balance building that I
 
05:00:45.470 --> 05:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
think I don't know I know you're saying
 
05:00:47.270 --> 05:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to solve that but that's
 
05:00:49.850 --> 05:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
not what I heard I heard some ambulance
 
05:00:52.250 --> 05:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
companies thought it was an appropriate
 
05:00:55.970 --> 05:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
fee for a user fee and that what really
 
05:00:59.330 --> 05:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
comes down to is that most in most
 
05:01:00.830 --> 05:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
ambulance services are somewhat related
 
05:01:02.690 --> 05:01:02.700 align:start position:0%
to the fire department the fire
 
05:01:04.010 --> 05:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
departments is something that every
 
05:01:05.750 --> 05:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
Town's got in their budgets we all
 
05:01:07.550 --> 05:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
expect to have our fire department we
 
05:01:09.890 --> 05:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
want our you know that uh to have that
 
05:01:11.750 --> 05:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Service and just like we want
 
05:01:13.910 --> 05:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
to have our fire trucks
 
05:01:16.490 --> 05:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
um but at the end of the day how to
 
05:01:19.788 --> 05:01:19.798 align:start position:0%
properly reimburse for the fees for the
 
05:01:19.798 --> 05:01:21.050 align:start position:0%
properly reimburse for the fees for the
costs

05:01:21.050 --> 05:01:21.060 align:start position:0%
costs
 
05:01:23.750 --> 05:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
um when this is really a investment by
 
05:01:26.270 --> 05:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
each Town each Community to provide an
 
05:01:28.070 --> 05:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
important service to their community and
 
05:01:29.448 --> 05:01:29.458 align:start position:0%
every Community has a different value
 
05:01:31.368 --> 05:01:31.378 align:start position:0%
system everyone has a different way to
 
05:01:33.050 --> 05:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
do it some have it's a separate
 
05:01:34.970 --> 05:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
non-profit some is part of their fire
 
05:01:36.830 --> 05:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
department everyone some of them are
 
05:01:39.288 --> 05:01:39.298 align:start position:0%
just private private companies so you
 
05:01:40.550 --> 05:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
know you're you've got a lot of
 
05:01:40.560 --> 05:01:42.070 align:start position:0%
know you're you've got a lot of
different

05:01:42.070 --> 05:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:01:45.170 --> 05:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
providers all have different agendas
 
05:01:47.750 --> 05:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
different way to fund it and so to
 
05:01:49.070 --> 05:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
separate to think that you're going to
 
05:01:51.230 --> 05:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
solve the balance billing without you
 
05:01:53.628 --> 05:01:53.638 align:start position:0%
know I I'll tell you I have very
 
05:01:56.030 --> 05:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
distinct memories of the last time this
 
05:01:57.530 --> 05:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
bill you know when we last time we dealt
 
05:01:59.930 --> 05:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
with it it was I had a lot of fire
 
05:02:01.730 --> 05:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
department a lot of fire people coming
 
05:02:03.170 --> 05:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
up to me and say
 
05:02:05.810 --> 05:02:05.820 align:start position:0%
we want the balanced Bill don't take
 
05:02:07.970 --> 05:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
that away from us and certainly don't
 
05:02:09.288 --> 05:02:09.298 align:start position:0%
take it away from them if you haven't
 
05:02:11.330 --> 05:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
solved the the issue of how we're going
 
05:02:14.270 --> 05:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
to get properly reimbursed for this
 
05:02:15.948 --> 05:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
equipment and for services
 
05:02:18.410 --> 05:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
so having said that I will uh take
 
05:02:21.590 --> 05:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative Abramson
 
05:02:22.788 --> 05:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like somebody's talking
 
05:02:24.410 --> 05:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
about amending the bill did anyone
 
05:02:26.570 --> 05:02:26.580 align:start position:0%
actually uh produce an amendment through
 
05:02:29.390 --> 05:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
oil lessons what she did she's saying
 
05:02:30.770 --> 05:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
how this bill is different than the
 
05:02:32.690 --> 05:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
previous Bill how the pre the previous
 
05:02:37.430 --> 05:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:42.410 --> 05:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:44.330 --> 05:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:02:44.340 --> 05:02:45.490 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

05:02:45.490 --> 05:02:45.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:49.970 --> 05:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
I think I have a concern that I I do
 
05:02:51.830 --> 05:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
support what representative Weston is
 
05:02:54.410 --> 05:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
saying I do believe that having uh taken
 
05:02:56.208 --> 05:02:56.218 align:start position:0%
a piece and working on a piece and then
 
05:02:58.610 --> 05:02:58.620 align:start position:0%
building to a better uh to a better
 
05:03:00.770 --> 05:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
resolution with later legislation is a
 
05:03:02.510 --> 05:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
really good idea
 
05:03:04.190 --> 05:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
um that leads me to believe that perhaps
 
05:03:06.110 --> 05:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
retaining might be the better option so
 
05:03:08.208 --> 05:03:08.218 align:start position:0%
that we can better set the foundation
 
05:03:11.930 --> 05:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
for that future work I do support
 
05:03:14.570 --> 05:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
um and applaud the work of
 
05:03:15.948 --> 05:03:15.958 align:start position:0%
Representative Weston and those that
 
05:03:17.990 --> 05:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
worked with her but that is my thought
 
05:03:20.090 --> 05:03:20.100 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
05:03:23.448 --> 05:03:23.458 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative Burroughs
 
05:03:26.628 --> 05:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
thank you um I I could live with it
 
05:03:28.190 --> 05:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
either way but in support of
 
05:03:30.530 --> 05:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
Representative Weston I feel that we're
 
05:03:33.650 --> 05:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
asking consumers to Bear the brunt of a
 
05:03:36.050 --> 05:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
problem of a broken of a broken business
 
05:03:39.110 --> 05:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
model on the side of the ambulances and
 
05:03:40.970 --> 05:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
I I don't think the consumers should be
 
05:03:45.770 --> 05:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:45.780 --> 05:03:47.090 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:03:47.090 --> 05:03:47.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:03:49.250 --> 05:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
uh I assume Connie that you just haven't
 
05:03:51.708 --> 05:03:51.718 align:start position:0%
put your hand down so any any other
 
05:03:53.810 --> 05:03:53.820 align:start position:0%

05:05:52.610 --> 05:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
more discussion on the motion I mean
 
05:05:54.530 --> 05:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
that's what it all said we met the
 
05:05:57.288 --> 05:05:57.298 align:start position:0%
motion it's retained so we're we're all
 
05:06:01.070 --> 05:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
done with executive sessions
 
05:06:01.080 --> 05:06:02.150 align:start position:0%
done with executive sessions
yeah

05:06:02.150 --> 05:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:06:06.110 --> 05:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:07.850 --> 05:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
yeah it sure is
 
05:06:10.010 --> 05:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
I I don't know why like Zoom just
 
05:06:12.050 --> 05:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
crashed on my computer I guess I don't
 
05:06:15.128 --> 05:06:15.138 align:start position:0%
know what happened but it just cracks
 
05:06:18.788 --> 05:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
all right uh so we're ready to go into
 
05:06:21.288 --> 05:06:21.298 align:start position:0%

310 relative to vehicle repairs
 
05:06:29.690 --> 05:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
and um I don't have my list in front of
 
05:06:32.090 --> 05:06:32.100 align:start position:0%

kenweiler are you there
 
05:06:42.050 --> 05:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
in there
 
05:06:45.230 --> 05:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:50.510 --> 05:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:52.070 --> 05:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
car broke down
 
05:06:52.080 --> 05:06:57.770 align:start position:0%
car broke down
[Laughter]

05:06:57.770 --> 05:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:01.550 --> 05:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh no Ken all right uh does someone
 
05:07:02.690 --> 05:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
have the bill in front who's the
 
05:07:02.700 --> 05:07:04.690 align:start position:0%
have the bill in front who's the
co-sponsor

05:07:04.690 --> 05:07:04.700 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor
 
05:07:06.948 --> 05:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll ask any of the attendees
 
05:07:10.730 --> 05:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
would like to introduce the bill for Ken
 
05:07:13.128 --> 05:07:13.138 align:start position:0%
um Representative Steven Smith and
 
05:07:16.128 --> 05:07:16.138 align:start position:0%
Stapleton are the two co-sponsors Smith
 
05:07:17.448 --> 05:07:17.458 align:start position:0%
was probably not going to be here
 
05:07:20.150 --> 05:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
because he's sharing and looking really
 
05:07:24.110 --> 05:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
I see Smith by itself Smith is that you
 
05:07:26.030 --> 05:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
raise your hand because that's you if
 
05:07:28.010 --> 05:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
you like to speak
 
05:07:30.470 --> 05:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
or maybe that's not
 
05:07:32.650 --> 05:07:32.660 align:start position:0%
just all it says is Smith
 
05:07:32.660 --> 05:07:34.190 align:start position:0%
just all it says is Smith
uh

05:07:34.190 --> 05:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:07:36.830 --> 05:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
because nobody nobody wants to introduce
 
05:07:39.708 --> 05:07:39.718 align:start position:0%
the bill for me the only other thought I
 
05:07:41.868 --> 05:07:41.878 align:start position:0%
have is that if there is a phone caller
 
05:07:44.208 --> 05:07:44.218 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that that's
 
05:07:46.970 --> 05:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
representative of color oh okay I got
 
05:07:50.090 --> 05:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
Walt Stapleton all right
 
05:07:52.310 --> 05:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know what Pam you have to turn me
 
05:07:54.770 --> 05:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
back on again because I uh coming back
 
05:07:57.530 --> 05:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
in I lost my
 
05:07:59.510 --> 05:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
head kept co-hosting you and then you
 
05:08:02.650 --> 05:08:02.660 align:start position:0%
disappeared again exactly
 
05:08:04.850 --> 05:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
all right there you go
 
05:08:09.170 --> 05:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:09.180 --> 05:08:11.330 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:08:11.330 --> 05:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:08:14.270 --> 05:08:14.280 align:start position:0%

05:08:16.970 --> 05:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Stapleton
 
05:08:19.128 --> 05:08:19.138 align:start position:0%

05:08:26.628 --> 05:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
for uh letting me be a speaker here and
 
05:08:28.970 --> 05:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
I was not prepared to present the bill
 
05:08:31.970 --> 05:08:31.980 align:start position:0%
but in absence of the two others
 
05:08:34.310 --> 05:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
um I thought I would at least make an
 
05:08:37.610 --> 05:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
effort to stand in I'm Walt Stapleton
 
05:08:40.190 --> 05:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
um representative from Claremont ward 3
 
05:08:43.550 --> 05:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County District Five
 
05:08:47.810 --> 05:08:47.820 align:start position:0%
and I am a co-sponsor third in line on
 
05:08:49.670 --> 05:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:08:49.680 --> 05:08:52.670 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

05:08:52.670 --> 05:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:56.448 --> 05:08:56.458 align:start position:0%
HP 310 relative to
 
05:08:56.458 --> 05:08:58.090 align:start position:0%
HP 310 relative to
um

05:08:58.090 --> 05:08:58.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:01.010 --> 05:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
vehicle repairs
 
05:09:03.948 --> 05:09:03.958 align:start position:0%
um I believe this bill
 
05:09:06.610 --> 05:09:06.620 align:start position:0%
is good for protection against
 
05:09:10.070 --> 05:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
incomplete inadequate repairs and unfair
 
05:09:12.708 --> 05:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
Insurance prescriptions and claim
 
05:09:12.718 --> 05:09:14.090 align:start position:0%
Insurance prescriptions and claim
practices

05:09:14.090 --> 05:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
practices
 
05:09:16.310 --> 05:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
that would uh
 
05:09:20.448 --> 05:09:20.458 align:start position:0%
um otherwise enable that uh it's
 
05:09:23.448 --> 05:09:23.458 align:start position:0%
essential that with the complex nature
 
05:09:25.550 --> 05:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
of automobiles today
 
05:09:29.770 --> 05:09:29.780 align:start position:0%
that manufactures recommendations
 
05:09:32.990 --> 05:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
and prescriptions for repairs are are
 
05:09:37.550 --> 05:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
done accurately and according to what
 
05:09:40.788 --> 05:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
the engineers have designed for those
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
Vehicles were
 
05:09:45.310 --> 05:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
traveling at high speed on highways
 
05:09:49.250 --> 05:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
there are millions of vehicles uh to
 
05:09:52.208 --> 05:09:52.218 align:start position:0%
have incomplete and inadequate repairs
 
05:09:55.190 --> 05:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
jeopardizes the safety of the highway
 
05:09:57.050 --> 05:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
traveling public
 
05:09:57.060 --> 05:09:58.550 align:start position:0%
traveling public
and

05:09:58.550 --> 05:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:10:01.430 --> 05:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
um the passengers in those cars
 
05:10:05.170 --> 05:10:05.180 align:start position:0%
as well as bystanders and pedestrians on
 
05:10:08.750 --> 05:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
Wayside city streets
 
05:10:08.760 --> 05:10:10.190 align:start position:0%
Wayside city streets
um

05:10:10.190 --> 05:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:13.368 --> 05:10:13.378 align:start position:0%
I I can't speak to any further of the
 
05:10:15.410 --> 05:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
detail of the bill this is not my area
 
05:10:19.490 --> 05:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
of expertise but I was proud to uh want
 
05:10:22.610 --> 05:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
to sponsor it because of the concern for
 
05:10:25.390 --> 05:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
safety and the complexity that modern
 
05:10:28.250 --> 05:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
automobiles have today
 
05:10:30.650 --> 05:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
um so I'm hoping that if you have
 
05:10:33.770 --> 05:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
questions of the technical nature that's
 
05:10:37.250 --> 05:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
some following speakers will can testify
 
05:10:38.990 --> 05:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
better too
 
05:10:41.270 --> 05:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
um than myself but if I can answer
 
05:10:43.910 --> 05:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
anything I would be glad to try
 
05:10:46.368 --> 05:10:46.378 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the opportunity to
 
05:10:49.310 --> 05:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
testify on the supporter and co-sponsor
 
05:10:51.948 --> 05:10:51.958 align:start position:0%
of 310. thank you
 
05:10:51.958 --> 05:10:52.990 align:start position:0%
of 310. thank you
okay

05:10:52.990 --> 05:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:10:58.010 --> 05:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:00.050 --> 05:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
remember the uh
 
05:11:02.990 --> 05:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
conversations about this bill it's a
 
05:11:03.000 --> 05:11:04.690 align:start position:0%
conversations about this bill it's a
pretty

05:11:04.690 --> 05:11:04.700 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
05:11:08.448 --> 05:11:08.458 align:start position:0%
intense actually but just for my
 
05:11:08.458 --> 05:11:10.190 align:start position:0%
intense actually but just for my
edification

05:11:10.190 --> 05:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
edification
 
05:11:15.350 --> 05:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:15.360 --> 05:11:16.868 align:start position:0%
 
the

05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:11:19.670 --> 05:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
rebuttal presumption appears in several
 
05:11:22.730 --> 05:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
aspects of our statutes relative to
 
05:11:22.740 --> 05:11:24.110 align:start position:0%
aspects of our statutes relative to
liability

05:11:24.110 --> 05:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
liability
 
05:11:28.190 --> 05:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
and it presumes um that there there is
 
05:11:30.530 --> 05:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
an expectation
 
05:11:30.540 --> 05:11:31.430 align:start position:0%
an expectation
um

05:11:31.430 --> 05:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:34.430 --> 05:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh or a freedom from
 
05:11:36.410 --> 05:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
um in the case of liability a freedom
 
05:11:40.010 --> 05:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
from liability that that is reputable
 
05:11:41.628 --> 05:11:41.638 align:start position:0%
um for instance
 
05:11:41.638 --> 05:11:42.368 align:start position:0%
um for instance
um

05:11:42.368 --> 05:11:42.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:45.650 --> 05:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
landowners who allow
 
05:11:48.948 --> 05:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
um our TV ATV trails snowmobile trails
 
05:11:51.770 --> 05:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
through their property are given a
 
05:11:55.788 --> 05:11:55.798 align:start position:0%
certain waiver of liability and that's a
 
05:11:58.010 --> 05:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption
 
05:12:00.650 --> 05:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
um and if they unless they do something
 
05:12:03.788 --> 05:12:03.798 align:start position:0%
untoward that would affect the Travelers
 
05:12:07.368 --> 05:12:07.378 align:start position:0%
otherwise Travelers on those Trails
 
05:12:10.090 --> 05:12:10.100 align:start position:0%
rights of way have uh
 
05:12:12.470 --> 05:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
and when they have an accident it can't
 
05:12:15.590 --> 05:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
go and Sue the landowner just because
 
05:12:18.230 --> 05:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
the landowner gave her permission but if
 
05:12:20.090 --> 05:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
the landowner did something like put
 
05:12:21.970 --> 05:12:21.980 align:start position:0%
something in the trail away
 
05:12:25.490 --> 05:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
then the rebuttable aspect enables that
 
05:12:29.990 --> 05:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
to person to challenge the waiver and uh
 
05:12:35.150 --> 05:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
sue for damages and injuries and in this
 
05:12:38.590 --> 05:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
case the rebuttable presumption on the
 
05:12:41.448 --> 05:12:41.458 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's recommendations are
 
05:12:41.458 --> 05:12:42.590 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's recommendations are
necessary

05:12:42.590 --> 05:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
05:12:47.090 --> 05:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
and if there is something uh variable in
 
05:12:50.150 --> 05:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
an accident claim situation then that
 
05:12:52.550 --> 05:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
can be brought to court in a lawsuit to
 
05:12:56.868 --> 05:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
rebut the Assumption of those necessary
 
05:12:59.750 --> 05:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
prescriptions for vehicle repairs
 
05:13:02.090 --> 05:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know does that help answer the
 
05:13:04.670 --> 05:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
question well this me uh yes can I
 
05:13:07.730 --> 05:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
continue chairman for the question so
 
05:13:10.250 --> 05:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
when it comes to car repairs
 
05:13:13.070 --> 05:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill is to allow
 
05:13:13.080 --> 05:13:14.930 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill is to allow
independent

05:13:14.930 --> 05:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
independent
 
05:13:14.940 --> 05:13:16.788 align:start position:0%
independent
uh

05:13:16.788 --> 05:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:13:16.798 --> 05:13:18.770 align:start position:0%
uh
shops

05:13:18.770 --> 05:13:18.780 align:start position:0%
shops
 
05:13:21.530 --> 05:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
access to
 
05:13:21.540 --> 05:13:22.250 align:start position:0%
access to
um

05:13:22.250 --> 05:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:23.930 --> 05:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
repair work
 
05:13:26.628 --> 05:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
even though the even though the uh
 
05:13:28.610 --> 05:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer May
 
05:13:30.830 --> 05:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
claim that uh
 
05:13:34.190 --> 05:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh they must do you know their their
 
05:13:36.650 --> 05:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
designated a dealership must do the
 
05:13:39.410 --> 05:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
repairs so the rebuttable presumption
 
05:13:43.730 --> 05:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
allows for the independent shop
 
05:13:47.270 --> 05:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
shop owner to do business
 
05:13:50.628 --> 05:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
on these cars is that correct
 
05:13:53.448 --> 05:13:53.458 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry I missed the last few words
 
05:13:55.430 --> 05:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
of that the the rebuttable presumption
 
05:13:58.910 --> 05:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
of people's independent shop to do what
 
05:14:02.208 --> 05:14:02.218 align:start position:0%
to do the repairs to do the repairs
 
05:14:02.218 --> 05:14:02.868 align:start position:0%
to do the repairs to do the repairs
um

05:14:02.868 --> 05:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:05.810 --> 05:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
I I would say so but the obligation on
 
05:14:08.570 --> 05:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
the individual shop is to be familiar
 
05:14:11.510 --> 05:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
with what uh the the
 
05:14:13.550 --> 05:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
um the manufacturer's recommendations
 
05:14:16.128 --> 05:14:16.138 align:start position:0%
would be relative to those repairs and
 
05:14:19.310 --> 05:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
if there's any recalls for instance
 
05:14:21.530 --> 05:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
um or industry practices that are
 
05:14:21.540 --> 05:14:23.030 align:start position:0%
um or industry practices that are
prescribed

05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
prescribed
 
05:14:25.490 --> 05:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
um it's a moving environment as
 
05:14:27.890 --> 05:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
Engineers modify some of the parts and
 
05:14:30.530 --> 05:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
some of the things that they uh they
 
05:14:33.170 --> 05:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
have that are going wrong or compromised
 
05:14:34.490 --> 05:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
on vehicles
 
05:14:36.730 --> 05:14:36.740 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it doesn't preclude
 
05:14:39.830 --> 05:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
independent shops from being able to do
 
05:14:39.840 --> 05:14:44.150 align:start position:0%
independent shops from being able to do
repairs

05:14:44.150 --> 05:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:47.690 --> 05:14:47.700 align:start position:0%
all right yep I'm good okay representing
 
05:14:47.700 --> 05:14:52.930 align:start position:0%
all right yep I'm good okay representing
him

05:14:52.930 --> 05:14:52.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:56.810 --> 05:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair
 
05:15:00.170 --> 05:15:00.180 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I have a a series of
 
05:15:00.180 --> 05:15:01.310 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I have a a series of
questions

05:15:01.310 --> 05:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:15:04.190 --> 05:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
um knowing a bit about vehicle repairs
 
05:15:05.810 --> 05:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
and my family having been in that
 
05:15:08.628 --> 05:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
business for 50 years
 
05:15:11.270 --> 05:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
um I just I just wonder
 
05:15:11.280 --> 05:15:12.350 align:start position:0%
um I just I just wonder
um

05:15:12.350 --> 05:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:15.050 --> 05:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
and I and I guess I heard it it covers
 
05:15:18.708 --> 05:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
all vehicles um snow machines or or cars
 
05:15:23.030 --> 05:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
I I guess this covers everything uh but
 
05:15:25.850 --> 05:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
uh back to the automobiles um is there
 
05:15:29.150 --> 05:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
any age of the vehicle or once the
 
05:15:32.270 --> 05:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle is out of warranty
 
05:15:34.070 --> 05:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
um I think I think it might be a little
 
05:15:37.730 --> 05:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
difficult for independent uh repair
 
05:15:37.740 --> 05:15:38.990 align:start position:0%
difficult for independent uh repair
shops

05:15:38.990 --> 05:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
shops
 
05:15:41.628 --> 05:15:41.638 align:start position:0%
um to be a hundred percent
 
05:15:43.810 --> 05:15:43.820 align:start position:0%
um familiar with all the
 
05:15:46.970 --> 05:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
manufacturers manufacturers
 
05:15:50.570 --> 05:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
um recommended everything as far as a
 
05:15:54.470 --> 05:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
car is concerned uh when the car is 12
 
05:15:58.010 --> 05:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
years old or or beyond beyond the
 
05:16:01.550 --> 05:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
ability to go to the um garage the
 
05:16:04.310 --> 05:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
dealer to have it repaired
 
05:16:07.128 --> 05:16:07.138 align:start position:0%
um I'm just I'm just wondering uh what
 
05:16:10.430 --> 05:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
what vehicles are covered under this
 
05:16:12.830 --> 05:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
right thank you for the question that's
 
05:16:14.270 --> 05:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
a great question
 
05:16:14.280 --> 05:16:14.930 align:start position:0%
a great question
um

05:16:14.930 --> 05:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:18.110 --> 05:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
I I happen to own and restoring uh used
 
05:16:21.590 --> 05:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
to drive a 1940 Pontiac
 
05:16:24.410 --> 05:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
um the only manufacturer's
 
05:16:26.810 --> 05:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
recommendations and I can Avail at this
 
05:16:28.970 --> 05:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
point are the older manuals repair
 
05:16:32.990 --> 05:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
manuals probably going up to about 1957
 
05:16:35.930 --> 05:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
or 58 beyond that it it kind of
 
05:16:38.208 --> 05:16:38.218 align:start position:0%
evaporates and disappears
 
05:16:40.430 --> 05:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
and later
 
05:16:43.550 --> 05:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
um earlier age vehicles uh you know in
 
05:16:46.070 --> 05:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
the 80s or the 90s there's still
 
05:16:48.410 --> 05:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
information available
 
05:16:51.288 --> 05:16:51.298 align:start position:0%
um out of out of very good technical
 
05:16:53.628 --> 05:16:53.638 align:start position:0%
manuals that you probably have used in
 
05:16:55.550 --> 05:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
your shop and have a collection of them
 
05:16:59.510 --> 05:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
on a on a desk and in files
 
05:17:03.590 --> 05:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
um I think the focus is for these later
 
05:17:06.350 --> 05:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
newer models of vehicles that are
 
05:17:08.770 --> 05:17:08.780 align:start position:0%
extremely complex
 
05:17:13.670 --> 05:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
and those where the sensitivity area is
 
05:17:13.680 --> 05:17:14.448 align:start position:0%
and those where the sensitivity area is
um

05:17:14.448 --> 05:17:14.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:17.270 --> 05:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know my 40 Pontiac doesn't have
 
05:17:20.448 --> 05:17:20.458 align:start position:0%
Direction segments and uh you know it
 
05:17:22.910 --> 05:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
has different brake capabilities than
 
05:17:25.190 --> 05:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
the new cars but the new cars can do all
 
05:17:27.470 --> 05:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
kinds of things especially with cameras
 
05:17:30.590 --> 05:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
on them they Park themselves this is
 
05:17:34.430 --> 05:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
high technical complexity and with that
 
05:17:37.250 --> 05:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
complexity we we need to have certain
 
05:17:39.530 --> 05:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
guidelines and to be able to follow them
 
05:17:41.448 --> 05:17:41.458 align:start position:0%
but it's no different than what we're
 
05:17:44.628 --> 05:17:44.638 align:start position:0%
experiencing with the zoom phenomenon uh
 
05:17:47.690 --> 05:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
with remote hearings
 
05:17:50.030 --> 05:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
um it's Technical and complex and
 
05:17:52.788 --> 05:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
sometimes difficult and gives us bugs
 
05:17:55.368 --> 05:17:55.378 align:start position:0%
and problems that are are tough to solve
 
05:17:58.610 --> 05:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
to get it working so we and when I'm
 
05:18:02.150 --> 05:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
going to do my vehicle repairs
 
05:18:03.890 --> 05:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
um and I'm underneath the car because
 
05:18:06.350 --> 05:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
I've done that for a number of years and
 
05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
I come across a difficult problem even
 
05:18:12.050 --> 05:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
on a newer car before I do anything I'll
 
05:18:13.788 --> 05:18:13.798 align:start position:0%
go to YouTube or I'll go to the
 
05:18:16.670 --> 05:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturer site and how to take this
 
05:18:18.948 --> 05:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
apart and how to assemble it properly so
 
05:18:22.010 --> 05:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
I don't have a a rework situation and a
 
05:18:24.350 --> 05:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
breakdown on the road so it is critical
 
05:18:26.868 --> 05:18:26.878 align:start position:0%
to continue to follow manufacturers
 
05:18:30.890 --> 05:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh where available
 
05:18:50.208 --> 05:18:50.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:52.750 --> 05:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
sorry I muted sorry I didn't I mute
 
05:18:56.690 --> 05:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:59.628 --> 05:18:59.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my call and my
 
05:18:59.638 --> 05:19:01.010 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my call and my
question

05:19:01.010 --> 05:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:19:02.930 --> 05:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm not mechanically inclined by
 
05:19:04.368 --> 05:19:04.378 align:start position:0%
any means that's why I have my husband
 
05:19:07.070 --> 05:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:08.390 --> 05:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
um I asked him to help me understand
 
05:19:10.128 --> 05:19:10.138 align:start position:0%
this and I just want to make sure I
 
05:19:11.750 --> 05:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
05:19:14.570 --> 05:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
the way I'm reading this is basically
 
05:19:16.610 --> 05:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
with saying that the insurance companies
 
05:19:19.190 --> 05:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
are required we're requiring that the
 
05:19:21.230 --> 05:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
05:19:24.110 --> 05:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
if so there's an accident and my
 
05:19:26.030 --> 05:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
windshield breaks and they have specific
 
05:19:28.550 --> 05:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
things in my windshield
 
05:19:28.560 --> 05:19:29.690 align:start position:0%
things in my windshield
that

05:19:29.690 --> 05:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:19:31.910 --> 05:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
we're requiring the insurance company to
 
05:19:34.128 --> 05:19:34.138 align:start position:0%
cover that cost to make sure any
 
05:19:36.050 --> 05:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
calibrations that need to be done are
 
05:19:36.060 --> 05:19:37.490 align:start position:0%
calibrations that need to be done are
covered

05:19:37.490 --> 05:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
covered
 
05:19:40.330 --> 05:19:40.340 align:start position:0%
based off of the manufacturer's
 
05:19:43.910 --> 05:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations because what I I'm
 
05:19:45.590 --> 05:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
getting kind of confused at some of the
 
05:19:47.510 --> 05:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
questions because based on how I'm
 
05:19:50.150 --> 05:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
reading we're basically saying that if a
 
05:19:51.650 --> 05:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
vehicle is
 
05:19:55.070 --> 05:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
in an accident and it gets repaired that
 
05:19:57.288 --> 05:19:57.298 align:start position:0%
some of the insurance companies are not
 
05:19:59.690 --> 05:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
covering the cost of recalibrating some
 
05:20:02.690 --> 05:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
of these issues that can come up
 
05:20:05.448 --> 05:20:05.458 align:start position:0%
and that now the
 
05:20:07.610 --> 05:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
the owner of the vehicle now has to
 
05:20:08.990 --> 05:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
cover those calibrations because the
 
05:20:11.330 --> 05:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
insurance company isn't doing it and I
 
05:20:12.890 --> 05:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
just want to understand that that's what
 
05:20:15.650 --> 05:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get at
 
05:20:18.170 --> 05:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
I I believe so the
 
05:20:22.250 --> 05:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
um the tendency to understate or under
 
05:20:25.310 --> 05:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
award a claim I think has been too
 
05:20:28.330 --> 05:20:28.340 align:start position:0%
prevalent in many circumstances not all
 
05:20:31.250 --> 05:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
but again with these complex Vehicles
 
05:20:34.550 --> 05:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
today with cameras backup systems
 
05:20:36.970 --> 05:20:36.980 align:start position:0%
self-driving self-parking
 
05:20:40.128 --> 05:20:40.138 align:start position:0%
calibration is absolutely critical and
 
05:20:42.470 --> 05:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
we don't want the insurance companies to
 
05:20:44.810 --> 05:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
say well we're maybe it's fifteen
 
05:20:46.550 --> 05:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar repair but we're only
 
05:20:48.708 --> 05:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
going to give you a thousand and so he
 
05:20:50.570 --> 05:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
has to start start to take shortcuts
 
05:20:53.570 --> 05:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
with uh maybe a secondary piece of
 
05:20:55.670 --> 05:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
equipment and maybe not so much of the
 
05:20:59.390 --> 05:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
test and recalibration uh adjustment end
 
05:21:00.708 --> 05:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
of it
 
05:21:02.510 --> 05:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
um that that's what we want to avoid
 
05:21:07.670 --> 05:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
again targeting for safety and complete
 
05:21:09.590 --> 05:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
effective repair
 
05:21:11.510 --> 05:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
and we don't want the insurance
 
05:21:15.170 --> 05:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
companies to cut that effort short uh by
 
05:21:18.890 --> 05:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
short uh award on adjustments and um
 
05:21:21.170 --> 05:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
therefore the the bill coordinates
 
05:21:23.930 --> 05:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
repairs Insurance claim payments with
 
05:21:26.810 --> 05:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
the necessary repairs as recommended by
 
05:21:30.170 --> 05:21:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:32.448 --> 05:21:32.458 align:start position:0%
so you just felt more of the fact of
 
05:21:34.730 --> 05:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
like calibrating you know like wheel
 
05:21:38.030 --> 05:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
census sometimes or like I said the
 
05:21:39.830 --> 05:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
windshield or backup camera to make sure
 
05:21:43.070 --> 05:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
everything is in sync as it should be to
 
05:21:45.350 --> 05:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
make sure it's safe excuse me yeah
 
05:21:48.890 --> 05:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:48.900 --> 05:21:50.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:21:50.990 --> 05:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:21:52.970 --> 05:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead I'm sorry I missed the
 
05:21:55.788 --> 05:21:55.798 align:start position:0%
question the follow-up question on that
 
05:21:58.070 --> 05:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to make sure I'm I'm
 
05:22:00.708 --> 05:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
understanding what the request of this
 
05:22:03.530 --> 05:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
bill is is that you know it's basically
 
05:22:05.270 --> 05:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
making sure that the calibrations are
 
05:22:07.010 --> 05:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
done after an accident so that the
 
05:22:09.830 --> 05:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
vehicles are safe based on manufactured
 
05:22:11.750 --> 05:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
specifications and it's not being
 
05:22:16.510 --> 05:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
ignored as a as a need after an accident
 
05:22:19.788 --> 05:22:19.798 align:start position:0%
uh correct uh the safety aspect is of
 
05:22:22.850 --> 05:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
Paramount importance and the um we want
 
05:22:25.368 --> 05:22:25.378 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies to be sensitive
 
05:22:28.610 --> 05:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
to that and compliant with that uh and
 
05:22:32.750 --> 05:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
not uh short uh award any claims for
 
05:22:35.570 --> 05:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
repairs uh that might compromise the
 
05:22:38.150 --> 05:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
safety of the repair so uh we're
 
05:22:40.128 --> 05:22:40.138 align:start position:0%
pointing to the manufacturer's
 
05:22:43.128 --> 05:22:43.138 align:start position:0%
recommendations for all the aspects of
 
05:22:45.590 --> 05:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
that particular repair
 
05:22:51.350 --> 05:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:56.448 --> 05:22:56.458 align:start position:0%
okay uh next is I'm sorry
 
05:22:56.458 --> 05:22:58.208 align:start position:0%
okay uh next is I'm sorry
um

05:22:58.208 --> 05:22:58.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:02.810 --> 05:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:04.490 --> 05:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:23:04.500 --> 05:23:05.330 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

05:23:05.330 --> 05:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:06.770 --> 05:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton would you
 
05:23:08.090 --> 05:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
believe that we have been working on
 
05:23:10.550 --> 05:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
this bill for many years we've had study
 
05:23:12.230 --> 05:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
committees and there will probably be a
 
05:23:14.150 --> 05:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
lot of people behind you that could
 
05:23:16.310 --> 05:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
answer some of these questions
 
05:23:20.090 --> 05:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
yes I would believe that and yeah some
 
05:23:22.788 --> 05:23:22.798 align:start position:0%
some of these things are tough to get
 
05:23:25.368 --> 05:23:25.378 align:start position:0%
focused in on and nailed down and I
 
05:23:27.050 --> 05:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
appreciate all the work you've been
 
05:23:30.830 --> 05:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
doing uh on this um and I think we still
 
05:23:33.470 --> 05:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
have to strive for it until we we get it
 
05:23:35.150 --> 05:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
and get it done so that we can
 
05:23:37.730 --> 05:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
coordinate insurance with repairs for
 
05:23:37.740 --> 05:23:40.610 align:start position:0%
coordinate insurance with repairs for
safety

05:23:40.610 --> 05:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:40.620 --> 05:23:42.170 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:23:42.170 --> 05:23:42.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:23:45.470 --> 05:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative Abramson
 
05:23:47.330 --> 05:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:23:49.010 --> 05:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:23:51.190 --> 05:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
um was it your intent under this bill
 
05:23:53.990 --> 05:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
that some of these newer cars with those
 
05:23:57.050 --> 05:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
fancier equipment not use
 
05:23:58.850 --> 05:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
um you know recycled materials that they
 
05:24:02.270 --> 05:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
only use new OEM Parts not uh Parts off
 
05:24:08.990 --> 05:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:10.070 --> 05:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
um they
 
05:24:12.830 --> 05:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
for the safe repair
 
05:24:15.110 --> 05:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
um the OEM
 
05:24:19.430 --> 05:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
the part that meets the specification is
 
05:24:24.110 --> 05:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
is primary now can that part be from
 
05:24:26.750 --> 05:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
recycled materials or from different
 
05:24:26.760 --> 05:24:29.690 align:start position:0%
recycled materials or from different
manufacturers

05:24:29.690 --> 05:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
05:24:29.700 --> 05:24:30.530 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
um

05:24:30.530 --> 05:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:32.868 --> 05:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
that's that's a good question and a
 
05:24:35.690 --> 05:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
tough one to answer and I would have to
 
05:24:38.990 --> 05:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
say that if the um alternate
 
05:24:41.270 --> 05:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturer part or the recycled
 
05:24:43.490 --> 05:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
material part
 
05:24:46.368 --> 05:24:46.378 align:start position:0%
um doesn't meet the specifications then
 
05:24:49.810 --> 05:24:49.820 align:start position:0%
it should not be utilized for the repair
 
05:24:52.788 --> 05:24:52.798 align:start position:0%
the determination may be that the
 
05:24:55.850 --> 05:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
difficult uh fact and sometimes the
 
05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturers will specify only use
 
05:25:03.170 --> 05:25:03.180 align:start position:0%
original OEM parts for this particular
 
05:25:03.180 --> 05:25:04.250 align:start position:0%
original OEM parts for this particular
repair

05:25:04.250 --> 05:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
repair
 
05:25:07.010 --> 05:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
and so that's our Flagger warning now
 
05:25:08.570 --> 05:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
they're going to want to protect their
 
05:25:11.448 --> 05:25:11.458 align:start position:0%
line of trade and business in doing that
 
05:25:13.970 --> 05:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
but there's also a safety aspect for
 
05:25:16.850 --> 05:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
that recommendation as well
 
05:25:20.570 --> 05:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
um in my my experience of my own car
 
05:25:24.170 --> 05:25:24.180 align:start position:0%
repairs I've used both
 
05:25:27.890 --> 05:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
a secondary market parts as well as OEM
 
05:25:30.590 --> 05:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
Parts sometimes the secondary markets
 
05:25:33.530 --> 05:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
work sometimes not so bad much and I've
 
05:25:36.948 --> 05:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
gone to replacing with the dealer uh
 
05:25:39.230 --> 05:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturer part even though it's more
 
05:25:42.830 --> 05:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
money that's generally more reliable and
 
05:25:45.410 --> 05:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
so as I grow older and want to be
 
05:25:47.570 --> 05:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
underneath the automobile less and less
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
especially at winter conditions I'm
 
05:25:52.610 --> 05:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
inclined to go to the dealer and get the
 
05:25:56.690 --> 05:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
OEM part and if there's a problem I got
 
05:25:59.390 --> 05:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
the dealer to bring it back to and then
 
05:26:01.610 --> 05:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
your view is the right part so if
 
05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
there's something that breaks down and
 
05:26:06.170 --> 05:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
it creates a liability I think I've got
 
05:26:10.010 --> 05:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
a better chance at a defense in court
 
05:26:10.020 --> 05:26:14.030 align:start position:0%
a better chance at a defense in court
follow-up

05:26:14.030 --> 05:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:16.670 --> 05:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
oh he's gone here I'll just ask him all
 
05:26:18.770 --> 05:26:18.780 align:start position:0%
right yeah go ahead sorry you may
 
05:26:18.780 --> 05:26:20.030 align:start position:0%
right yeah go ahead sorry you may
inquire

05:26:20.030 --> 05:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
inquire
 
05:26:23.750 --> 05:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh so sometimes when I repair my car
 
05:26:25.970 --> 05:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
when I'm looking for parts sometimes I
 
05:26:25.980 --> 05:26:26.770 align:start position:0%
when I'm looking for parts sometimes I
use

05:26:26.770 --> 05:26:26.780 align:start position:0%
use
 
05:26:30.410 --> 05:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
uh new copies that are just as good and
 
05:26:33.288 --> 05:26:33.298 align:start position:0%
sometimes they use uh used OEM Parts
 
05:26:34.970 --> 05:26:34.980 align:start position:0%
like what you find at a junkyard you
 
05:26:36.590 --> 05:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
know you know what Max I I hate to do
 
05:26:37.910 --> 05:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
this to you but
 
05:26:40.490 --> 05:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
um we have other people who are are much
 
05:26:42.470 --> 05:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
more intimate exactly what this bill is
 
05:26:43.850 --> 05:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
and I know like you have a sense of
 
05:26:44.810 --> 05:26:44.820 align:start position:0%
where you're going with your questions
 
05:26:46.788 --> 05:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:26:48.110 --> 05:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
um I think I think some of the other
 
05:26:49.190 --> 05:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
people who are going to come up are
 
05:26:50.510 --> 05:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
probably more appropriate to ask these
 
05:26:52.368 --> 05:26:52.378 align:start position:0%
questions to because they'll explain to
 
05:26:54.288 --> 05:26:54.298 align:start position:0%
you this you know the law is if you have
 
05:26:55.788 --> 05:26:55.798 align:start position:0%
a brand new car
 
05:26:58.310 --> 05:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
um we're we're the statute requires you
 
05:27:00.770 --> 05:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
to have to put in uh manufacture the
 
05:27:03.230 --> 05:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
manufactured Parts but OEM stuff comes
 
05:27:05.090 --> 05:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
in later so I think it's probably best
 
05:27:07.610 --> 05:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
that we you hear from other people
 
05:27:10.368 --> 05:27:10.378 align:start position:0%
um who will testify who can get more uh
 
05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
articulate what you're I think you're
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
going with it well no I was actually
 
05:27:17.270 --> 05:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
just asking what the co-sponsor's intent
 
05:27:20.208 --> 05:27:20.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:22.010 --> 05:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
what he's trying to accomplish from the
 
05:27:22.020 --> 05:27:24.948 align:start position:0%
what he's trying to accomplish from the
bill

05:27:24.948 --> 05:27:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:24.958 --> 05:27:26.288 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:27:26.288 --> 05:27:26.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:30.830 --> 05:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
I would I would say that the safety and
 
05:27:33.470 --> 05:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
the coordinate those uh mandate
 
05:27:35.570 --> 05:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
insurance payments and cover the correct
 
05:27:37.910 --> 05:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
repair of
 
05:27:37.920 --> 05:27:38.810 align:start position:0%
repair of
um

05:27:38.810 --> 05:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:41.090 --> 05:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
of the manufacturer's recommendations
 
05:27:45.050 --> 05:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
and parks for safety of customer quality
 
05:27:47.448 --> 05:27:47.458 align:start position:0%
and safety
 
05:27:49.250 --> 05:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
05:27:51.410 --> 05:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
um representative Grayson
 
05:27:53.628 --> 05:27:53.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:27:55.970 --> 05:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
representative Staples and and Mr
 
05:27:57.650 --> 05:27:57.660 align:start position:0%
chairman it may be that I'll have to
 
05:27:59.810 --> 05:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
defer my question until some sometime
 
05:28:02.030 --> 05:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
later but I'll ask and then you tell me
 
05:28:05.390 --> 05:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
if I need to uh if I need to hold off my
 
05:28:08.990 --> 05:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
question my question is does this bill
 
05:28:12.350 --> 05:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
enable manufacturers to so specialize
 
05:28:15.110 --> 05:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
their parts that requires so many
 
05:28:17.868 --> 05:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
special tools that would require so many
 
05:28:20.390 --> 05:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
special recommendations as to basically
 
05:28:22.550 --> 05:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
put your local repair shop out of
 
05:28:22.560 --> 05:28:26.270 align:start position:0%
put your local repair shop out of
business

05:28:26.270 --> 05:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:29.868 --> 05:28:29.878 align:start position:0%
well that's a good question and um we
 
05:28:32.810 --> 05:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
are already there relative to um
 
05:28:35.448 --> 05:28:35.458 align:start position:0%
the specialty technical aspects of
 
05:28:38.270 --> 05:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles and special tools and special
 
05:28:38.280 --> 05:28:39.788 align:start position:0%
vehicles and special tools and special
procedures

05:28:39.788 --> 05:28:39.798 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
05:28:43.730 --> 05:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
I know myself I don't I won't work on a
 
05:28:45.550 --> 05:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
uh a a
 
05:28:49.670 --> 05:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
2020 automobile uh work on my 1940
 
05:28:52.550 --> 05:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
Pontiac but uh the old the newer the
 
05:28:55.910 --> 05:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
vehicles got the more complex they are I
 
05:28:58.128 --> 05:28:58.138 align:start position:0%
don't think it's an intent to drive the
 
05:28:59.930 --> 05:28:59.940 align:start position:0%
smaller shop out of business I think
 
05:29:01.670 --> 05:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's a challenge for the small business
 
05:29:04.430 --> 05:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
to keep up with the vehicle the new
 
05:29:07.368 --> 05:29:07.378 align:start position:0%
vehicle safety and the repair standards
 
05:29:07.378 --> 05:29:08.750 align:start position:0%
vehicle safety and the repair standards
and

05:29:08.750 --> 05:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:29:11.448 --> 05:29:11.458 align:start position:0%
um I was in the computer business some
 
05:29:13.670 --> 05:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
years ago and I got out of it because I
 
05:29:15.590 --> 05:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't keep up with it now that wasn't
 
05:29:18.830 --> 05:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
the intent of the manufacturers and the
 
05:29:21.708 --> 05:29:21.718 align:start position:0%
Progressive Insurance Hardware it was
 
05:29:23.690 --> 05:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
just the fact that if I'm going to be a
 
05:29:25.910 --> 05:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
dealer I've got to keep up with the
 
05:29:29.208 --> 05:29:29.218 align:start position:0%
latest and be compliant
 
05:29:31.970 --> 05:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
I think it's just a natural a phenomenon
 
05:29:35.570 --> 05:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
of an advancing market and and Mark at
 
05:29:38.690 --> 05:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:42.230 --> 05:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Herbert you've
 
05:29:46.310 --> 05:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:50.150 --> 05:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
my questions to the chair okay
 
05:29:52.910 --> 05:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
um and having gone through some of the
 
05:29:56.150 --> 05:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
hearings in previous sessions yeah my
 
05:29:58.490 --> 05:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
question to you is
 
05:30:00.948 --> 05:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
what are the what is the likelihood
 
05:30:02.990 --> 05:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
of us actually
 
05:30:07.368 --> 05:30:07.378 align:start position:0%
fixing this bill one way or the other uh
 
05:30:08.570 --> 05:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
this year
 
05:30:08.580 --> 05:30:10.190 align:start position:0%
this year
hey

05:30:10.190 --> 05:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
hey
 
05:30:13.430 --> 05:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
um should we retain it we we might want
 
05:30:15.948 --> 05:30:15.958 align:start position:0%
to retain it uh you know the history of
 
05:30:17.810 --> 05:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
this bill just for everyone to say
 
05:30:21.110 --> 05:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
because uh if I I believe the issue is
 
05:30:21.120 --> 05:30:22.490 align:start position:0%
because uh if I I believe the issue is
that

05:30:22.490 --> 05:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:30:26.930 --> 05:30:26.940 align:start position:0%
um the um Auto Body companies uh feel
 
05:30:29.510 --> 05:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
that the insurance companies are trying
 
05:30:33.470 --> 05:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
to cut corners on getting cars repaired
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
is what the issue of this bill is about
 
05:30:39.530 --> 05:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
so we can take it from there
 
05:30:41.810 --> 05:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
um it yes we've had this bill multiple
 
05:30:45.890 --> 05:30:45.900 align:start position:0%
times and and it hasn't done so well it
 
05:30:47.830 --> 05:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
did pass the committee last year
 
05:30:50.448 --> 05:30:50.458 align:start position:0%
with a different you know
 
05:30:53.628 --> 05:30:53.638 align:start position:0%
it was great difficulty and a great
 
05:30:55.490 --> 05:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
difficulty and different committee mix
 
05:30:58.250 --> 05:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
yes okay you guys gonna raise your lower
 
05:31:01.368 --> 05:31:01.378 align:start position:0%
your hands just so I feel okay about uh
 
05:31:04.010 --> 05:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
okay so um I normally would call on
 
05:31:07.070 --> 05:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
George russos but I'm Scott Robertson uh
 
05:31:10.190 --> 05:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
as as in a time frame so time limit so
 
05:31:13.430 --> 05:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to uh invite him to testify at
 
05:31:15.050 --> 05:31:15.060 align:start position:0%
this point I have
 
05:31:17.750 --> 05:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I have anybody I
 
05:31:19.368 --> 05:31:19.378 align:start position:0%
certainly don't have anybody who's in
 
05:31:20.868 --> 05:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
support of the bill who wants to speak
 
05:31:23.390 --> 05:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't say to the attendees if
 
05:31:25.070 --> 05:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
you want to support the bill please
 
05:31:27.110 --> 05:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
raise your hand so I can get you next
 
05:31:30.050 --> 05:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
after Scott go ahead Scott hi my name is
 
05:31:32.690 --> 05:31:32.700 align:start position:0%
Scott Robertson and I am the current
 
05:31:35.090 --> 05:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
president of the Automotive recyclist
 
05:31:38.208 --> 05:31:38.218 align:start position:0%
Association where the um for the
 
05:31:40.010 --> 05:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
association of of
 
05:31:42.530 --> 05:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
um Auto Salvage facilities throughout
 
05:31:43.490 --> 05:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
the world
 
05:31:46.190 --> 05:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
I'm also owner and president of
 
05:31:48.948 --> 05:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
Robertson's Auto Salvage in Wareham
 
05:31:51.350 --> 05:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and our family of
 
05:31:54.708 --> 05:31:54.718 align:start position:0%
businesses include a brand new GMC truck
 
05:31:57.170 --> 05:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
dealership and a body shop
 
05:31:59.150 --> 05:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
so I'd say that I pretty much represent
 
05:32:02.150 --> 05:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
all three I've managed our body shop
 
05:32:04.670 --> 05:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
our Salvage facilities and under the
 
05:32:07.070 --> 05:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
same roof as our dealership I have all
 
05:32:07.080 --> 05:32:07.910 align:start position:0%
same roof as our dealership I have all
three

05:32:07.910 --> 05:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:32:10.910 --> 05:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
and make no doubt about it this bill
 
05:32:14.750 --> 05:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
here is an oem repair procedure bill
 
05:32:17.448 --> 05:32:17.458 align:start position:0%
it's just taken a different route
 
05:32:20.208 --> 05:32:20.218 align:start position:0%
it states within this bill vehicle is
 
05:32:22.788 --> 05:32:22.798 align:start position:0%
repaired with applicable manufacturer's
 
05:32:22.798 --> 05:32:24.230 align:start position:0%
repaired with applicable manufacturer's
recommendations

05:32:24.230 --> 05:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
05:32:26.930 --> 05:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
while the vehicle manufacturers they
 
05:32:29.628 --> 05:32:29.638 align:start position:0%
only recommend vehicles to be repaired
 
05:32:32.930 --> 05:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
with their parts and only their parts
 
05:32:35.150 --> 05:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
they don't allow the use of new
 
05:32:38.690 --> 05:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
aftermarket they don't allow the the use
 
05:32:42.830 --> 05:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
of new opt OEM which is a brand new part
 
05:32:45.410 --> 05:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
that was manufactured by A supplier of
 
05:32:48.890 --> 05:32:48.900 align:start position:0%
General Motors or Ford or Chrysler but
 
05:32:51.230 --> 05:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
sold out a different Channel not sold
 
05:32:53.090 --> 05:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
through the dealership Channel
 
05:32:55.490 --> 05:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
and it certainly doesn't allow the use
 
05:32:58.030 --> 05:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
of recycled original equipment parts
 
05:33:01.310 --> 05:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
most most of you know that that is used
 
05:33:02.690 --> 05:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
auto parts
 
05:33:02.700 --> 05:33:03.230 align:start position:0%
auto parts
[Music]

05:33:03.230 --> 05:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:33:03.240 --> 05:33:03.948 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

05:33:03.948 --> 05:33:03.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:06.530 --> 05:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
this restricts the consumer's choice and
 
05:33:09.230 --> 05:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
where and how a vehicle is repaired thus
 
05:33:11.990 --> 05:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
driving up the costs of the repair
 
05:33:13.970 --> 05:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
a recycled original equipment part is
 
05:33:16.190 --> 05:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
not only cheaper but is far better from
 
05:33:18.230 --> 05:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
the environment than using a new part in
 
05:33:20.330 --> 05:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
repairs the automotive recycling
 
05:33:23.570 --> 05:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
industry is actually carbon negative
 
05:33:25.550 --> 05:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
I know there's a big big push now with
 
05:33:27.288 --> 05:33:27.298 align:start position:0%
the new Administration about being green
 
05:33:30.590 --> 05:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
when you buy a used auto part you you're
 
05:33:32.930 --> 05:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
helping the environment
 
05:33:32.940 --> 05:33:34.550 align:start position:0%
helping the environment
but

05:33:34.550 --> 05:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:33:38.570 --> 05:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
the real crust of this bill is safety
 
05:33:40.670 --> 05:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
and it's all I hear is safety this bill
 
05:33:42.890 --> 05:33:42.900 align:start position:0%
mentions safety all the time
 
05:33:46.070 --> 05:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
it was truly about safety why is it only
 
05:33:48.530 --> 05:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
for insurance repairs and offer all
 
05:33:48.540 --> 05:33:50.628 align:start position:0%
for insurance repairs and offer all
repairs

05:33:50.628 --> 05:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
repairs
 
05:33:53.690 --> 05:33:53.700 align:start position:0%
ask yourself that question is the safety
 
05:33:56.810 --> 05:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
of a person driving is is there a life
 
05:33:59.448 --> 05:33:59.458 align:start position:0%
worth more if if they're insured and or
 
05:34:00.830 --> 05:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
not insured
 
05:34:03.288 --> 05:34:03.298 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it be for all repairs if it's
 
05:34:05.510 --> 05:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
truly about safety
 
05:34:07.910 --> 05:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
now the manufacturers have a long
 
05:34:11.448 --> 05:34:11.458 align:start position:0%
history of putting profits before safety
 
05:34:13.310 --> 05:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
and I've testified in front of you many
 
05:34:15.410 --> 05:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
times and I've always said that they've
 
05:34:17.090 --> 05:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
done that in the past
 
05:34:20.208 --> 05:34:20.218 align:start position:0%
just look back at the GM ignition switch
 
05:34:23.570 --> 05:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
GM waited 10 years until recalling and
 
05:34:25.490 --> 05:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
fixing a known problem because the
 
05:34:27.770 --> 05:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
injury settlements were cheaper than the
 
05:34:27.780 --> 05:34:29.208 align:start position:0%
injury settlements were cheaper than the
recall

05:34:29.208 --> 05:34:29.218 align:start position:0%
recall
 
05:34:32.810 --> 05:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
leopards don't change their spots
 
05:34:35.208 --> 05:34:35.218 align:start position:0%
profits over safety
 
05:34:37.250 --> 05:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
I just don't think you can trust the
 
05:34:38.930 --> 05:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
vehicle manufacturers to do the right
 
05:34:38.940 --> 05:34:40.208 align:start position:0%
vehicle manufacturers to do the right
thing

05:34:40.208 --> 05:34:40.218 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:34:45.250 --> 05:34:45.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:48.590 --> 05:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
I'll take that as a hand up Jane yes it
 
05:34:50.330 --> 05:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
is a handout it was easier for me to do
 
05:34:50.340 --> 05:34:51.890 align:start position:0%
is a handout it was easier for me to do
this

05:34:51.890 --> 05:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:34:54.170 --> 05:34:54.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:34:58.310 --> 05:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
my question uh Mr Robertson is this the
 
05:35:00.830 --> 05:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
right to repair bill that we heard so
 
05:35:03.830 --> 05:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
much about in Massachusetts no the right
 
05:35:06.010 --> 05:35:06.020 align:start position:0%
to repay a bill was first passed in
 
05:35:10.128 --> 05:35:10.138 align:start position:0%
2012. and that was to um for the vehicle
 
05:35:12.288 --> 05:35:12.298 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to give the independent
 
05:35:15.708 --> 05:35:15.718 align:start position:0%
repair shop shops access to information
 
05:35:18.350 --> 05:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
uh the regular repair bill that was just
 
05:35:21.530 --> 05:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
passed now which now is in court is all
 
05:35:24.230 --> 05:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
about telematics now the cars nowadays
 
05:35:26.628 --> 05:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
are very smart and very complex I don't
 
05:35:29.270 --> 05:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
argue that question at all
 
05:35:31.190 --> 05:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
um it takes a lot of training to be able
 
05:35:33.170 --> 05:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
to fix these cars
 
05:35:36.110 --> 05:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
um but these cars can communicate and
 
05:35:38.628 --> 05:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
they send data back to the Vehicle
 
05:35:41.690 --> 05:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
Manufacturer it's where that data goes
 
05:35:44.510 --> 05:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
and who owns that data if you're driving
 
05:35:47.208 --> 05:35:47.218 align:start position:0%
a car you might want your car fixed at
 
05:35:49.490 --> 05:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
your brother-in-law's repair shop and
 
05:35:51.410 --> 05:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
you want your data to go over to his
 
05:35:52.910 --> 05:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
repair shop you don't want it to go to
 
05:35:55.490 --> 05:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
General Motors it you can't even point
 
05:35:57.350 --> 05:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
it to a dealership you want it to to go
 
05:36:00.110 --> 05:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
to it goes back to Detroit or wherever
 
05:36:02.090 --> 05:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
Kentucky where the car is built where
 
05:36:04.070 --> 05:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
the headquarters are and they decide
 
05:36:07.810 --> 05:36:07.820 align:start position:0%
what dealer is going to get that
 
05:36:10.788 --> 05:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
information to contact you to fix that
 
05:36:10.798 --> 05:36:11.868 align:start position:0%
information to contact you to fix that
car

05:36:11.868 --> 05:36:11.878 align:start position:0%
car
 
05:36:15.368 --> 05:36:15.378 align:start position:0%
all right thanks thanks for that okay
 
05:36:20.330 --> 05:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:22.970 --> 05:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you and just to be sure that uh
 
05:36:25.010 --> 05:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
recycled parts are almost always OEM
 
05:36:28.310 --> 05:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
parts that is correct
 
05:36:30.948 --> 05:36:30.958 align:start position:0%
so you're saying so now with if they're
 
05:36:34.730 --> 05:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
not using recycled OEM parts to the uh
 
05:36:37.010 --> 05:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
repair shops sometimes use uh other than
 
05:36:40.670 --> 05:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
OEM parts for example knockoffs
 
05:36:43.070 --> 05:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
yes they will use what's called an uh
 
05:36:44.810 --> 05:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
what What's called an aftermarket part
 
05:36:46.368 --> 05:36:46.378 align:start position:0%
now if you speak to a Vehicle
 
05:36:49.368 --> 05:36:49.378 align:start position:0%
Manufacturer they call every part that's
 
05:36:52.250 --> 05:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
not theirs in aftermarket parts
 
05:36:55.010 --> 05:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
but in in my industry an aftermarket
 
05:36:57.230 --> 05:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
part is is a brand new park
 
05:37:00.288 --> 05:37:00.298 align:start position:0%
that was made by someone other than the
 
05:37:02.868 --> 05:37:02.878 align:start position:0%
Vehicle Manufacturer it's sort of like
 
05:37:04.128 --> 05:37:04.138 align:start position:0%
going into
 
05:37:08.868 --> 05:37:08.878 align:start position:0%
um a CVS and instead of buying a Motrin
 
05:37:10.670 --> 05:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
you buy a CBS
 
05:37:14.810 --> 05:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
uh Motrin it's it's it's cheaper
 
05:37:16.670 --> 05:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
it does the same thing
 
05:37:18.708 --> 05:37:18.718 align:start position:0%
you know affects your body the same way
 
05:37:22.368 --> 05:37:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:24.650 --> 05:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
all right fair enough well said
 
05:37:26.390 --> 05:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you very much Mr
 
05:37:29.270 --> 05:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh the chair will call on

05:39:34.190 --> 05:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
for some reason the screen is not in
 
05:39:37.490 --> 05:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
sync with the phone I don't know why
 
05:39:39.948 --> 05:39:39.958 align:start position:0%

all right I've been working on this
 
05:39:58.490 --> 05:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
issue since sharing a study committee in
 
05:39:58.500 --> 05:40:09.050 align:start position:0%
issue since sharing a study committee in
2018.

05:40:09.050 --> 05:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:11.208 --> 05:40:11.218 align:start position:0%
you still there
 
05:40:13.970 --> 05:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
yeah they're still there I'm I'm
 
05:40:15.650 --> 05:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
distracted by looking at the screen
 
05:40:17.570 --> 05:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
because it's it's two minutes off or
 
05:40:19.730 --> 05:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
something don't don't
 
05:40:26.270 --> 05:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:28.670 --> 05:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh I've been working on this issue since
 
05:40:31.010 --> 05:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
chairing a study committee in 2018. we
 
05:40:32.930 --> 05:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
heard from many independent repair shops
 
05:40:34.610 --> 05:40:34.620 align:start position:0%
that were not getting a fair deal from
 
05:40:36.410 --> 05:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
an insurance companies and paying for
 
05:40:38.330 --> 05:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
vehicle repair
 
05:40:40.250 --> 05:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies would pay one
 
05:40:40.260 --> 05:40:46.550 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies would pay one
rate

05:40:46.550 --> 05:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:51.110 --> 05:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know what's going on all right
 
05:41:01.628 --> 05:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:03.770 --> 05:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
I can hear a little something in the
 
05:41:07.788 --> 05:41:07.798 align:start position:0%
background but yeah getting dropped out
 
05:41:10.310 --> 05:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
no I'm talking still
 
05:41:14.510 --> 05:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
the repair shops would pay one rate uh
 
05:41:16.310 --> 05:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
for dealers but would expect to pay less
 
05:41:20.510 --> 05:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:22.190 --> 05:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
some of the gimmicks used by the
 
05:41:24.230 --> 05:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
insurers were sure to find a shop that
 
05:41:26.270 --> 05:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
would pay bid for Less on the repairs
 
05:41:30.350 --> 05:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:32.868 --> 05:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
some laws referred to only using parts
 
05:41:39.110 --> 05:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:39.120 --> 05:41:40.310 align:start position:0%
 
but

05:41:40.310 --> 05:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:41:43.090 --> 05:41:43.100 align:start position:0%
the Philippines
 
05:41:45.708 --> 05:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
all right some law is referred to only
 
05:41:49.970 --> 05:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
parts of like kind and quality referred
 
05:41:53.690 --> 05:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
to as LKQ so one company was selling
 
05:41:57.368 --> 05:41:57.378 align:start position:0%
used parts labeled themselves LKQ
 
05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
disagreements between the repair shops
 
05:42:01.670 --> 05:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
and the insurance company went to the
 
05:42:03.770 --> 05:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
insurance department to be settled the
 
05:42:05.208 --> 05:42:05.218 align:start position:0%
shops felt that the department was
 
05:42:06.890 --> 05:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
always biased in favor of the insurance
 
05:42:08.570 --> 05:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
company even though the department
 
05:42:10.850 --> 05:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
admitted that their officials that were
 
05:42:12.830 --> 05:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
sent out to look at the parts were not
 
05:42:15.708 --> 05:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
qualified repairs sometimes they just
 
05:42:17.090 --> 05:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
looked at pictures
 
05:42:18.948 --> 05:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
we passed an earlier bill in this
 
05:42:20.510 --> 05:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
committee to deal with the problem it's
 
05:42:23.390 --> 05:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
just about exactly the same bill it also
 
05:42:25.970 --> 05:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
passed the Senate the Commissioners sure
 
05:42:28.788 --> 05:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
Insurance went to the commission of
 
05:42:30.830 --> 05:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
insurance no that had nothing to do with
 
05:42:33.770 --> 05:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
uh and then it went to the Senate where
 
05:42:35.868 --> 05:42:35.878 align:start position:0%
it was tabled along with so much of our
 
05:42:37.910 --> 05:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
other good work
 
05:42:39.890 --> 05:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
so this bill makes it clear that the
 
05:42:41.448 --> 05:42:41.458 align:start position:0%
insurance companies cannot ask any
 
05:42:43.970 --> 05:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
repair to do less than the work that the
 
05:42:46.730 --> 05:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
vehicles manufacturer says is needed to
 
05:42:48.410 --> 05:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
restore it to the standard to which it
 
05:42:49.430 --> 05:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
was made
 
05:42:51.770 --> 05:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
I had proposed an amendment to the
 
05:42:54.650 --> 05:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
earlier Bill to have disputes on repairs
 
05:42:56.810 --> 05:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
judged by a neutral party which you may
 
05:42:58.850 --> 05:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
still think is necessary such as
 
05:43:00.948 --> 05:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety vehicle inspectors
 
05:43:03.410 --> 05:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
that amendment was not adopted but you
 
05:43:06.948 --> 05:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
might consider it but this is Bill is
 
05:43:09.230 --> 05:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
the same as you passed last year and
 
05:43:11.270 --> 05:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
went to the Senate and it passed the
 
05:43:14.030 --> 05:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
house on a roll call vote I think 216 to
 
05:43:16.628 --> 05:43:16.638 align:start position:0%
106. thank you
 
05:43:19.788 --> 05:43:19.798 align:start position:0%
thank you uh will you be able to take
 
05:43:19.798 --> 05:43:25.010 align:start position:0%
thank you uh will you be able to take
questions

05:43:25.010 --> 05:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:27.770 --> 05:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
I guess not okay
 
05:43:29.690 --> 05:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:43:32.750 --> 05:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
can you you all said Ken
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
yeah what I'm watching on the screen
 
05:43:35.930 --> 05:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
John is about two minutes behind what
 
05:43:38.030 --> 05:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
we're doing on the phone I was telling
 
05:43:39.530 --> 05:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
you to stop doing that don't watch on
 
05:43:43.030 --> 05:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:46.850 --> 05:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
watch what I'll do okay I'll mute it if
 
05:43:48.350 --> 05:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
he's watching YouTube That's there's a
 
05:43:50.650 --> 05:43:50.660 align:start position:0%
delay on that oh the YouTube
 
05:43:53.090 --> 05:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
YouTube all right
 
05:43:57.170 --> 05:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
I'm off of YouTube okay great uh where
 
05:43:59.330 --> 05:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
are you willing to take questions
 
05:44:01.970 --> 05:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
I am okay representative greeson has a
 
05:44:01.980 --> 05:44:03.170 align:start position:0%
I am okay representative greeson has a
question

05:44:03.170 --> 05:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:44:06.048 --> 05:44:06.058 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:44:08.690 --> 05:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler uh what happens if
 
05:44:12.708 --> 05:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
a car cannot be repaired
 
05:44:16.128 --> 05:44:16.138 align:start position:0%
to the pre-accident condition as
 
05:44:18.890 --> 05:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
determined by the manufacturer yet would
 
05:44:21.890 --> 05:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
still be safe enough to pass a state
 
05:44:23.990 --> 05:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
inspection otherwise
 
05:44:26.810 --> 05:44:26.820 align:start position:0%
what what happens then
 
05:44:29.350 --> 05:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
well in some instances this has happened
 
05:44:32.868 --> 05:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
and then they had an accident and the
 
05:44:35.750 --> 05:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
accident was not survivable uh somebody
 
05:44:38.990 --> 05:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
brought up a case in Texas where a roof
 
05:44:40.910 --> 05:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
was welded on rather than glued on and
 
05:44:43.010 --> 05:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
you couldn't tell that but the people
 
05:44:44.868 --> 05:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
died and there was a huge lawsuit
 
05:44:47.628 --> 05:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't done to the specs you
 
05:44:48.770 --> 05:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
know somebody tried to sue the
 
05:44:50.150 --> 05:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturer because the people should
 
05:44:51.830 --> 05:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
have survived it but they didn't survive
 
05:44:54.470 --> 05:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
it because the car was repaired in a way
 
05:44:57.230 --> 05:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
that was not uh to the manufacturer's
 
05:44:59.090 --> 05:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
specs so that's one of the reasons why
 
05:45:01.610 --> 05:45:01.620 align:start position:0%
some of the repairers thought you've got
 
05:45:03.410 --> 05:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
to go by manufacturer specs because
 
05:45:05.628 --> 05:45:05.638 align:start position:0%
they're looking at other repair shops
 
05:45:08.510 --> 05:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
that give them a Bad Name by covering up
 
05:45:13.730 --> 05:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:16.250 --> 05:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason you could possibly
 
05:45:18.530 --> 05:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
drive it but it you wouldn't expect to
 
05:45:21.410 --> 05:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
have the same warranty and protection
 
05:45:21.420 --> 05:45:22.548 align:start position:0%
have the same warranty and protection
okay

05:45:22.548 --> 05:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:45:25.128 --> 05:45:25.138 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:45:26.690 --> 05:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
05:45:28.850 --> 05:45:28.860 align:start position:0%
uh see none we're all set okay well
 
05:45:30.590 --> 05:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Ken so you can stay on and
 
05:45:32.030 --> 05:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
listen in
 
05:45:36.410 --> 05:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you John and uh all right okay uh
 
05:45:40.670 --> 05:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
George russos is now
 
05:45:43.010 --> 05:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak I turned your video
 
05:45:45.948 --> 05:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
off George oh okay so you have to turn
 
05:45:47.868 --> 05:45:47.878 align:start position:0%
your video back on if you want one video
 
05:45:49.930 --> 05:45:49.940 align:start position:0%
or I guess I can turn it back on you
 
05:45:52.490 --> 05:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
stopped it I'm gonna I'm gonna say ask
 
05:45:54.948 --> 05:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
to start video there we go there we go
 
05:45:54.958 --> 05:45:57.788 align:start position:0%
to start video there we go there we go
okay

05:45:57.788 --> 05:45:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:00.770 --> 05:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman members
 
05:46:01.910 --> 05:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
05:46:06.350 --> 05:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
uh this is uh a topic that is other
 
05:46:08.930 --> 05:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
speakers have said has been around for
 
05:46:11.930 --> 05:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
a long time and it's about as
 
05:46:14.030 --> 05:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
controversial an issue as I've dealt
 
05:46:18.110 --> 05:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
with uh over the years and um I think
 
05:46:20.930 --> 05:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
that it's a frustrating issue for a lot
 
05:46:24.110 --> 05:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
of us to deal with and I would like to
 
05:46:25.850 --> 05:46:25.860 align:start position:0%
explain why
 
05:46:25.860 --> 05:46:26.690 align:start position:0%
explain why
um

05:46:26.690 --> 05:46:26.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:28.670 --> 05:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
and I think a good starting point
 
05:46:32.390 --> 05:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
because I think that a lot of what folks
 
05:46:34.970 --> 05:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
have said expressing concerns about the
 
05:46:37.970 --> 05:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
current system is based on a lack of to
 
05:46:40.128 --> 05:46:40.138 align:start position:0%
be candidate a lack of understanding of
 
05:46:42.948 --> 05:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
how things work today
 
05:46:44.750 --> 05:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
um this has been pitted as a battle
 
05:46:48.590 --> 05:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
between the uh the auto repairs and the
 
05:46:52.250 --> 05:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
insurance company send naturally there's
 
05:46:54.830 --> 05:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
going to be a tension between the two
 
05:46:59.690 --> 05:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
the the objective of the auto repair
 
05:47:02.090 --> 05:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
um like any businessman is to maximize
 
05:47:02.100 --> 05:47:03.830 align:start position:0%
um like any businessman is to maximize
profits

05:47:03.830 --> 05:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
profits
 
05:47:06.288 --> 05:47:06.298 align:start position:0%
the objective of the insurance company
 
05:47:10.070 --> 05:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
is to have work done safely in a timely
 
05:47:10.080 --> 05:47:11.030 align:start position:0%
is to have work done safely in a timely
manner

05:47:11.030 --> 05:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
manner
 
05:47:15.288 --> 05:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
and at the lowest cost and so there's
 
05:47:17.270 --> 05:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
always going to be tensions and that's
 
05:47:19.310 --> 05:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
why we've seen this bill and other bills
 
05:47:22.970 --> 05:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
I think over the years proposed by the
 
05:47:26.868 --> 05:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
automobile dealers and
 
05:47:29.750 --> 05:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
if I may say I think that it's certainly
 
05:47:33.530 --> 05:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
not your job to do something to help
 
05:47:36.230 --> 05:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and we don't ask you
 
05:47:38.750 --> 05:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
to do that uh I don't think it's your
 
05:47:43.190 --> 05:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
job to help the auto repairs either the
 
05:47:44.930 --> 05:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
largest of them are the automobile
 
05:47:44.940 --> 05:47:46.190 align:start position:0%
largest of them are the automobile
dealers

05:47:46.190 --> 05:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
dealers
 
05:47:49.310 --> 05:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
who I believe it's so make more money
 
05:47:52.430 --> 05:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
repairing Vehicles than selling them
 
05:47:55.310 --> 05:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
so it's a big business and it's a
 
05:47:57.708 --> 05:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
business that is increasingly becoming
 
05:48:00.650 --> 05:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
as automobile repairs become more and
 
05:48:02.810 --> 05:48:02.820 align:start position:0%
more sophisticated as others have
 
05:48:05.930 --> 05:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh with the diagnostic tools
 
05:48:09.110 --> 05:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
that didn't exist 10 years ago and the
 
05:48:11.690 --> 05:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
ones that are coming in the next five or
 
05:48:15.548 --> 05:48:15.558 align:start position:0%
ten years uh as it becomes more complex
 
05:48:19.190 --> 05:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh fewer and fewer shops are able to do
 
05:48:20.090 --> 05:48:20.100 align:start position:0%
the work
 
05:48:23.090 --> 05:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
and the work is going to some
 
05:48:25.490 --> 05:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
independent large independent shops they
 
05:48:28.010 --> 05:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
can afford the Machinery to do scans and
 
05:48:31.190 --> 05:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
calibrations and repairs uh and a lot of
 
05:48:32.990 --> 05:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
it to the dealers
 
05:48:35.030 --> 05:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
now I'm just gonna
 
05:48:36.650 --> 05:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit
 
05:48:36.660 --> 05:48:38.288 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit
about

05:48:38.288 --> 05:48:38.298 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:48:38.298 --> 05:48:39.850 align:start position:0%
about
manufacturers

05:48:39.850 --> 05:48:39.860 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
05:48:42.770 --> 05:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
recommendations and I think someone who
 
05:48:44.930 --> 05:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
follows me may go into some more
 
05:48:47.208 --> 05:48:47.218 align:start position:0%
specifics about that but
 
05:48:50.750 --> 05:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
man this is not a uh this is not an
 
05:48:52.448 --> 05:48:52.458 align:start position:0%
instruction manual
 
05:48:56.150 --> 05:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
this manufacturer's recommendation uh
 
05:48:56.160 --> 05:48:57.770 align:start position:0%
this manufacturer's recommendation uh
includes

05:48:57.770 --> 05:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
includes
 
05:49:00.410 --> 05:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
all kinds thousands and thousands of
 
05:49:03.110 --> 05:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
communications each vehicle in each
 
05:49:05.750 --> 05:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
model has its own recommendations that
 
05:49:07.670 --> 05:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
come from the manufacturer
 
05:49:09.770 --> 05:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
some of them are sound some of them
 
05:49:13.610 --> 05:49:13.620 align:start position:0%
clearly uh are not things that uh should
 
05:49:16.910 --> 05:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
be followed a manufacturer can recommend
 
05:49:18.410 --> 05:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
whatever they want
 
05:49:20.628 --> 05:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
there's no control there's no agency
 
05:49:23.090 --> 05:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
that regulates what a manufacturer
 
05:49:26.510 --> 05:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
recommends and under this bill
 
05:49:28.670 --> 05:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
anything that is recommended by the
 
05:49:31.570 --> 05:49:31.580 align:start position:0%
manufacturer is presumed uh to be
 
05:49:35.330 --> 05:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
correct and that goes way too far and
 
05:49:37.850 --> 05:49:37.860 align:start position:0%
they're examples that can be given some
 
05:49:38.948 --> 05:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
have been
 
05:49:40.910 --> 05:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
alluded to
 
05:49:43.250 --> 05:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh where the manufacturer for example
 
05:49:43.260 --> 05:49:44.868 align:start position:0%
uh where the manufacturer for example
says

05:49:44.868 --> 05:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
says
 
05:49:46.810 --> 05:49:46.820 align:start position:0%
you can only use
 
05:49:50.708 --> 05:49:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:53.690 --> 05:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
or it says you can only have the part
 
05:49:58.128 --> 05:49:58.138 align:start position:0%
repaired with the following uh tools
 
05:50:01.788 --> 05:50:01.798 align:start position:0%
or only by a certified dealer which is
 
05:50:03.590 --> 05:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
more and more what's going on this is a
 
05:50:07.788 --> 05:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
very Dynamic field and and repairs the
 
05:50:10.250 --> 05:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
manufacturers I think it's
 
05:50:14.208 --> 05:50:14.218 align:start position:0%
very fair to say I prefer the deal with
 
05:50:17.930 --> 05:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
fewer uh repairs that they have
 
05:50:20.510 --> 05:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
relationships with and so these
 
05:50:23.628 --> 05:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
recommendations cut out the independent
 
05:50:25.368 --> 05:50:25.378 align:start position:0%
dealer that I think a lot of you are
 
05:50:28.190 --> 05:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
trying to protect and are concerned
 
05:50:31.670 --> 05:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
about in favor of the large economically
 
05:50:36.110 --> 05:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
powerful uh repair so again on
 
05:50:37.788 --> 05:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
manufacturers then there's tons of
 
05:50:42.650 --> 05:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
examples but one that I recall uh I I
 
05:50:45.590 --> 05:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
don't remember the manufacturer but uh
 
05:50:48.470 --> 05:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
it said that if there's any accident
 
05:50:50.868 --> 05:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
that causes any damage
 
05:50:53.690 --> 05:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
to the body of the car
 
05:50:57.128 --> 05:50:57.138 align:start position:0%
the recommendation is that the repair
 
05:51:00.470 --> 05:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
removes the steering wheel
 
05:51:00.480 --> 05:51:01.310 align:start position:0%
removes the steering wheel
um

05:51:01.310 --> 05:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:05.990 --> 05:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh look at the sensors and then replace
 
05:51:07.910 --> 05:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
it which is a two three hundred dollar
 
05:51:11.448 --> 05:51:11.458 align:start position:0%
repair if I if I recall now Common Sense
 
05:51:16.310 --> 05:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
tells you uh when and when not to uh to
 
05:51:19.850 --> 05:51:19.860 align:start position:0%
to perform such a a recommendation of
 
05:51:22.250 --> 05:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer but under this bill
 
05:51:24.410 --> 05:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
there's no control whatsoever there's no
 
05:51:27.048 --> 05:51:27.058 align:start position:0%
check or balance on the part of the
 
05:51:29.448 --> 05:51:29.458 align:start position:0%
insurance company to be sure that
 
05:51:32.390 --> 05:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary repairs are not performed
 
05:51:34.910 --> 05:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
let alone that they're not performed at
 
05:51:38.330 --> 05:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
a at a price that is excessive
 
05:51:38.340 --> 05:51:39.850 align:start position:0%
a at a price that is excessive
so

05:51:39.850 --> 05:51:39.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:43.730 --> 05:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
the question arose under this bill what
 
05:51:48.170 --> 05:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:48.180 --> 05:51:50.628 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:51:50.628 --> 05:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:53.208 --> 05:51:53.218 align:start position:0%
insurance adjusters and repairs have
 
05:51:55.490 --> 05:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
been dealing with one another for a
 
05:51:57.288 --> 05:51:57.298 align:start position:0%
hundred years now
 
05:51:57.298 --> 05:51:59.510 align:start position:0%
hundred years now
remember

05:51:59.510 --> 05:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
remember
 
05:52:01.730 --> 05:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge has there been a
 
05:52:04.610 --> 05:52:04.620 align:start position:0%
standard of rebuttable presumption to
 
05:52:07.610 --> 05:52:07.620 align:start position:0%
guide them in negotiating repair costs
 
05:52:09.770 --> 05:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
or what repairs are necessary
 
05:52:13.250 --> 05:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
that's a newly invented phrase when
 
05:52:16.250 --> 05:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
applied to this and it takes the
 
05:52:20.208 --> 05:52:20.218 align:start position:0%
bargaining power uh from an equal one to
 
05:52:23.208 --> 05:52:23.218 align:start position:0%
one where the repair
 
05:52:26.448 --> 05:52:26.458 align:start position:0%
uh is presumed if he follows the
 
05:52:30.890 --> 05:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's recommendation to uh to
 
05:52:31.850 --> 05:52:31.860 align:start position:0%
be correct
 
05:52:33.708 --> 05:52:33.718 align:start position:0%
puts a burden on the insurance company
 
05:52:38.270 --> 05:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
to then say uh no um here's evidence
 
05:52:40.610 --> 05:52:40.620 align:start position:0%
that you're incorrect no that's not a
 
05:52:43.128 --> 05:52:43.138 align:start position:0%
that's not a workable way to to do
 
05:52:43.138 --> 05:52:44.570 align:start position:0%
that's not a workable way to to do
business

05:52:44.570 --> 05:52:44.580 align:start position:0%
business
 
05:52:47.690 --> 05:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
also under the bill and perhaps one of
 
05:52:50.270 --> 05:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
the most important issues that the bill
 
05:52:52.610 --> 05:52:52.620 align:start position:0%
presents is at the end they talk about
 
05:52:54.770 --> 05:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
paint and materials
 
05:52:56.690 --> 05:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
now you can talk about safety and
 
05:53:00.288 --> 05:53:00.298 align:start position:0%
suggest that safety is an issue
 
05:53:03.048 --> 05:53:03.058 align:start position:0%
it really is not an issue and I can talk
 
05:53:05.030 --> 05:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
a little about that but let's assume
 
05:53:06.590 --> 05:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
you're right
 
05:53:08.510 --> 05:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
and you're concerned about safety and we
 
05:53:10.788 --> 05:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
all are concerned about safety
 
05:53:12.650 --> 05:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
what do you say about the last part of
 
05:53:13.788 --> 05:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:53:18.048 --> 05:53:18.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:20.868 --> 05:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
at least with respect to that part I
 
05:53:22.070 --> 05:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
think we could all agree it has nothing
 
05:53:24.110 --> 05:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
whatsoever to do with safety
 
05:53:26.868 --> 05:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
the quality of the of the paint job and
 
05:53:29.628 --> 05:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
safety are unrelated what we are talking
 
05:53:31.250 --> 05:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
about is cost
 
05:53:33.770 --> 05:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
and it's estimated that over half the
 
05:53:37.190 --> 05:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
cost of repair to a vehicle
 
05:53:40.128 --> 05:53:40.138 align:start position:0%
is paint and materials sounds like an
 
05:53:42.650 --> 05:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
awful lot but that's a statistic that I
 
05:53:45.410 --> 05:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
think is uh holds up
 
05:53:45.420 --> 05:53:47.330 align:start position:0%
think is uh holds up
so

05:53:47.330 --> 05:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:53:49.490 --> 05:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
about half of the increased cost in this
 
05:53:53.270 --> 05:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
bill comes from the paint materials uh
 
05:53:54.830 --> 05:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
section which has nothing to do with
 
05:53:54.840 --> 05:53:55.970 align:start position:0%
section which has nothing to do with
safety

05:53:55.970 --> 05:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
safety
 
05:53:58.850 --> 05:53:58.860 align:start position:0%
the insurance department has estimated
 
05:54:00.948 --> 05:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
that this bill would increase Insurance
 
05:54:05.990 --> 05:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:08.030 --> 05:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
and that excuse me that is consistent
 
05:54:10.850 --> 05:54:10.860 align:start position:0%
with what insurance companies uh
 
05:54:10.860 --> 05:54:12.048 align:start position:0%
with what insurance companies uh
estimate

05:54:12.048 --> 05:54:12.058 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
05:54:14.930 --> 05:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
now why in the world with this
 
05:54:17.830 --> 05:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
legislature want to subject its
 
05:54:22.868 --> 05:54:22.878 align:start position:0%
constituents to an increase in Insurance
 
05:54:26.030 --> 05:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
costs and I know you will weigh that
 
05:54:29.990 --> 05:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
carefully why would you do so well
 
05:54:32.990 --> 05:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
I think that there's two reasons that
 
05:54:35.750 --> 05:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
are kind of some of it below the surface
 
05:54:37.970 --> 05:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
a little bit and some of it right out in
 
05:54:42.530 --> 05:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
the open and uh uh one is that the
 
05:54:44.330 --> 05:54:44.340 align:start position:0%
it's presented that the The Little
 
05:54:47.270 --> 05:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
Dealer is is not getting a fair shake
 
05:54:50.990 --> 05:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
from the big insurance company and
 
05:54:55.670 --> 05:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
um the other is that cars are not uh
 
05:54:59.030 --> 05:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
safely uh repaired now
 
05:55:03.288 --> 05:55:03.298 align:start position:0%
the safety issue is one that has no
 
05:55:06.110 --> 05:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
evidence behind it with respect
 
05:55:08.390 --> 05:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler talks about a
 
05:55:09.770 --> 05:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
Texas case that every time there's
 
05:55:12.110 --> 05:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill they drag out
 
05:55:14.150 --> 05:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
this Texas case involving sheet metal
 
05:55:17.090 --> 05:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
six years ago that uh others have looked
 
05:55:19.070 --> 05:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
at and said that's kind of questionable
 
05:55:20.690 --> 05:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
to refer to that case in the first place
 
05:55:23.030 --> 05:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
but if that's the all the only evidence
 
05:55:25.490 --> 05:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
you have to suggest that vehicles are
 
05:55:29.150 --> 05:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
being repaired unsafely uh that's that's
 
05:55:31.910 --> 05:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
not enough to draw any conclusions from
 
05:55:36.350 --> 05:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh it seems obvious that if
 
05:55:38.810 --> 05:55:38.820 align:start position:0%
the motor vehicles in our state were not
 
05:55:42.048 --> 05:55:42.058 align:start position:0%
safely repaired we don't know about it
 
05:55:44.390 --> 05:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
we'd all know about it
 
05:55:46.788 --> 05:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
I tell you too it's in the interest of
 
05:55:49.610 --> 05:55:49.620 align:start position:0%
an insurance company that he to have a
 
05:55:51.170 --> 05:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
satisfied customer
 
05:55:54.048 --> 05:55:54.058 align:start position:0%
we want the car to be repaired safely
 
05:55:57.830 --> 05:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
and in a timely manner so in essence
 
05:56:02.390 --> 05:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
what is the relationships here are that
 
05:56:02.400 --> 05:56:03.170 align:start position:0%
what is the relationships here are that
the

05:56:03.170 --> 05:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:56:03.180 --> 05:56:05.390 align:start position:0%
the
insurance

05:56:05.390 --> 05:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
05:56:05.400 --> 05:56:06.048 align:start position:0%
insurance
um

05:56:06.048 --> 05:56:06.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:08.090 --> 05:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
the insurance company stands in the
 
05:56:09.350 --> 05:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
shoes of the
 
05:56:11.628 --> 05:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
person who buys Insurance of their
 
05:56:11.638 --> 05:56:13.430 align:start position:0%
person who buys Insurance of their
insured

05:56:13.430 --> 05:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
insured
 
05:56:16.490 --> 05:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
and if you look at it on a standpoint
 
05:56:18.230 --> 05:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
that you had no insurance
 
05:56:20.690 --> 05:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
your car was damaged in an accident what
 
05:56:22.070 --> 05:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
would you do
 
05:56:24.110 --> 05:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
well you'd want to get the best price
 
05:56:25.310 --> 05:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you
 
05:56:28.250 --> 05:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
'd want to have it repaired properly And
 
05:56:28.260 --> 05:56:29.208 align:start position:0%
'd want to have it repaired properly And
Timely

05:56:29.208 --> 05:56:29.218 align:start position:0%
Timely
 
05:56:31.250 --> 05:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
but it's the best price and that's
 
05:56:34.250 --> 05:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
exactly what the insurance companies do
 
05:56:34.260 --> 05:56:36.230 align:start position:0%
exactly what the insurance companies do
so

05:56:36.230 --> 05:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:56:39.650 --> 05:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of ground that I could
 
05:56:41.510 --> 05:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
be covered here
 
05:56:41.520 --> 05:56:42.470 align:start position:0%
be covered here
um

05:56:42.470 --> 05:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:46.910 --> 05:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
it is I I've found it uh
 
05:56:49.310 --> 05:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
it used to be an interesting issue and
 
05:56:51.530 --> 05:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
now it's getting to be kind of an old
 
05:56:53.530 --> 05:56:53.540 align:start position:0%
issue and I'm sure it is for some of you
 
05:56:56.510 --> 05:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh but I hope you will think carefully
 
05:56:59.510 --> 05:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh and and I think too I'm not sure what
 
05:57:02.090 --> 05:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
the insurance department uh will say to
 
05:57:04.910 --> 05:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
you today but uh in the past the
 
05:57:06.830 --> 05:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
insurance department has said
 
05:57:10.730 --> 05:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
that it opposes this bill it poses it
 
05:57:14.448 --> 05:57:14.458 align:start position:0%
because of the increased cost and the
 
05:57:18.470 --> 05:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
bill benefits uh it benefits the
 
05:57:18.480 --> 05:57:19.850 align:start position:0%
bill benefits uh it benefits the
uh

05:57:19.850 --> 05:57:19.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:57:22.730 --> 05:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
the automobile repair is the big repairs
 
05:57:24.948 --> 05:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
at the expense of the insurance buying
 
05:57:24.958 --> 05:57:25.788 align:start position:0%
at the expense of the insurance buying
public

05:57:25.788 --> 05:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:57:28.548 --> 05:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
and I I think that that's true
 
05:57:32.030 --> 05:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:36.170 --> 05:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
any questions for attorney Russo's
 
05:57:37.970 --> 05:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh I would say
 
05:57:40.368 --> 05:57:40.378 align:start position:0%
um well James Fox is not here today I'm
 
05:57:43.190 --> 05:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
not quite he was not able to make it but
 
05:57:45.230 --> 05:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
his position was neutral
 
05:57:48.948 --> 05:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
George so just so you know
 
05:57:52.670 --> 05:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
okay as I see no questions for attorney
 
05:57:52.680 --> 05:57:54.430 align:start position:0%
okay as I see no questions for attorney
russos

05:57:54.430 --> 05:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
russos
 
05:57:56.810 --> 05:57:56.820 align:start position:0%
uh again I
 
05:57:59.030 --> 05:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
um like is anybody who would like to
 
05:58:01.010 --> 05:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
speak in support of the bill I hope you
 
05:58:02.690 --> 05:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
could raise your hand if you're one of
 
05:58:04.490 --> 05:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
the attendees
 
05:58:05.810 --> 05:58:05.820 align:start position:0%
um so that we have a nice balanced
 
05:58:07.490 --> 05:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
hearing here
 
05:58:07.500 --> 05:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
hearing here
um

05:58:07.560 --> 05:58:07.570 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:07.570 --> 05:58:09.410 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

05:58:09.410 --> 05:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:58:13.548 --> 05:58:13.558 align:start position:0%
otherwise uh Jim Hayden is next
 
05:58:17.868 --> 05:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:19.910 --> 05:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
here we go
 
05:58:22.670 --> 05:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you Mr chairman uh members
 
05:58:24.830 --> 05:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh Jim Hayden again on
 
05:58:27.110 --> 05:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
behalf of State Farm insurance companies
 
05:58:30.048 --> 05:58:30.058 align:start position:0%
which uh frankly is one of those
 
05:58:32.150 --> 05:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
countries in New Hampshire's largest
 
05:58:35.510 --> 05:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
insurer of automobiles
 
05:58:37.610 --> 05:58:37.620 align:start position:0%
um we uh have
 
05:58:40.368 --> 05:58:40.378 align:start position:0%
been opposed to this bill and this idea
 
05:58:42.830 --> 05:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
since the first day it was introduced
 
05:58:46.250 --> 05:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
uh two or three years ago
 
05:58:48.410 --> 05:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm not too sure of what variation of
 
05:58:50.810 --> 05:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
the build this is now
 
05:58:53.208 --> 05:58:53.218 align:start position:0%
um but it is I think where it left off
 
05:58:55.070 --> 05:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:58:56.990 --> 05:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
um and I think in the best way to
 
05:58:59.270 --> 05:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
explain our opposition to this bill is
 
05:59:01.850 --> 05:59:01.860 align:start position:0%
to really go back and touch on a few
 
05:59:03.770 --> 05:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
points that George mentioned but try to
 
05:59:06.170 --> 05:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
put it in the context of how water
 
05:59:08.570 --> 05:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
repairs are handled under the laws of
 
05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and you know I think we
 
05:59:13.730 --> 05:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
need to First Focus uh on the fact that
 
05:59:15.708 --> 05:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
under our existing lives you know
 
05:59:17.750 --> 05:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are not allowed to
 
05:59:21.410 --> 05:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
steer business to automobile repairs
 
05:59:23.510 --> 05:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
um if you're in an accident or in your
 
05:59:26.090 --> 05:59:26.100 align:start position:0%
car is damaged you are free to choose
 
05:59:28.970 --> 05:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
any consumers free to choose uh the auto
 
05:59:31.670 --> 05:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
body of his or her choice
 
05:59:31.680 --> 05:59:32.948 align:start position:0%
body of his or her choice
um

05:59:32.948 --> 05:59:32.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:36.650 --> 05:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
basically uh in that context you know
 
05:59:38.810 --> 05:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
the insurer is required to pay for the
 
05:59:43.190 --> 05:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
repairs but he's not required to uh pay
 
05:59:44.690 --> 05:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
more than the fair and reasonable price
 
05:59:47.750 --> 05:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
for the repairs and by this process it
 
05:59:50.930 --> 05:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
allows the consumers their choice but it
 
05:59:52.970 --> 05:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
also protects the insurance company from
 
05:59:55.430 --> 05:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
being overcharged for those repairs and
 
05:59:57.948 --> 05:59:57.958 align:start position:0%
effectively this bill tries to wipe out
 
06:00:00.830 --> 06:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
that whole dynamic
 
06:00:04.850 --> 06:00:04.860 align:start position:0%
um when an automobile is damaging an
 
06:00:07.490 --> 06:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
insured accident an insurance adjuster
 
06:00:09.708 --> 06:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
or the repair shop identifies the
 
06:00:12.890 --> 06:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
repairs uh required to restore the
 
06:00:14.930 --> 06:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
vehicle to the pre-loss condition
 
06:00:17.270 --> 06:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
there's an estimate prepared to listen
 
06:00:20.628 --> 06:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
it details what needs to be done and
 
06:00:23.390 --> 06:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
once that estimate is prepared there are
 
06:00:25.430 --> 06:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
discussions and negotiations between the
 
06:00:26.810 --> 06:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
insurance adjuster and the repair
 
06:00:28.970 --> 06:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
facility regarding the scope of the
 
06:00:31.730 --> 06:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
repairs in this specific parts we needed
 
06:00:35.448 --> 06:00:35.458 align:start position:0%
and the vast majority of cases I mean
 
06:00:38.350 --> 06:00:38.360 align:start position:0%
the entirely vast amount of times
 
06:00:40.910 --> 06:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
those I worked out without any real
 
06:00:40.920 --> 06:00:42.948 align:start position:0%
those I worked out without any real
disputes

06:00:42.948 --> 06:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
disputes
 
06:00:44.990 --> 06:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
um but in this process and in this
 
06:00:47.570 --> 06:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
negotiation and in this discussion you
 
06:00:50.330 --> 06:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
know the insurers uh and repairs know
 
06:00:52.670 --> 06:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
that the auto manufacturers have an
 
06:00:54.410 --> 06:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
informed perspective about how to repair
 
06:00:57.530 --> 06:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
a car uh the auto repairs have review
 
06:00:59.810 --> 06:00:59.820 align:start position:0%
have views on the property pairs because
 
06:01:02.510 --> 06:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
they've learned how to fix them and the
 
06:01:04.670 --> 06:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
insurance company has views on how it
 
06:01:07.070 --> 06:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
should be done because frankly they
 
06:01:09.590 --> 06:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
adjust thousands and thousands of auto
 
06:01:12.230 --> 06:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
repairs and they everybody shares a
 
06:01:14.330 --> 06:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
common goal of a proper repair of an
 
06:01:14.340 --> 06:01:15.410 align:start position:0%
common goal of a proper repair of an
automobile

06:01:15.410 --> 06:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
automobile
 
06:01:18.230 --> 06:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
but it's only the insurers
 
06:01:20.750 --> 06:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh goal of ensuring that the price is
 
06:01:23.990 --> 06:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
not excessive and that's because they
 
06:01:26.448 --> 06:01:26.458 align:start position:0%
ultimately would need to pass the cost
 
06:01:29.510 --> 06:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the repairs along to their customers
 
06:01:31.670 --> 06:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
and no company would ever want to do
 
06:01:34.730 --> 06:01:34.740 align:start position:0%
that if and be forced to pass along an
 
06:01:36.890 --> 06:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
unnecessary cost
 
06:01:39.530 --> 06:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
um this bill really tries to eliminate
 
06:01:40.910 --> 06:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
the insurance company from that
 
06:01:44.448 --> 06:01:44.458 align:start position:0%
discussion and and that is really why it
 
06:01:46.970 --> 06:01:46.980 align:start position:0%
disrupts the economics of an auto repair
 
06:01:49.250 --> 06:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
process and that by itself should be the
 
06:01:52.730 --> 06:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
reason to reject the bill as a whole
 
06:01:55.548 --> 06:01:55.558 align:start position:0%
um we have heard that
 
06:01:55.558 --> 06:01:57.288 align:start position:0%
um we have heard that
um

06:01:57.288 --> 06:01:57.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:59.510 --> 06:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
um we have heard before that the
 
06:02:01.788 --> 06:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
06:02:04.730 --> 06:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
um was concerned about how this bill or
 
06:02:06.410 --> 06:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
how this type of Bill could raise rates
 
06:02:09.770 --> 06:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
it is the reason that the governor
 
06:02:12.890 --> 06:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
vetoed the bill two sessions ago
 
06:02:14.448 --> 06:02:14.458 align:start position:0%
um and I think that you know the
 
06:02:16.788 --> 06:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
proponents of this bill would rather not
 
06:02:20.150 --> 06:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
think about these types of things and I
 
06:02:21.650 --> 06:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
think we need to have to confront them
 
06:02:23.448 --> 06:02:23.458 align:start position:0%
here today
 
06:02:23.458 --> 06:02:24.530 align:start position:0%
here today
um

06:02:24.530 --> 06:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:24.540 --> 06:02:25.670 align:start position:0%
um
um

06:02:25.670 --> 06:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:29.990 --> 06:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
but we also can focus on
 
06:02:30.000 --> 06:02:30.788 align:start position:0%
but we also can focus on
um

06:02:30.788 --> 06:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:34.010 --> 06:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
the the need to save for safe repairs
 
06:02:36.530 --> 06:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
because if you read between the lines
 
06:02:38.448 --> 06:02:38.458 align:start position:0%
you know to the extent any of this is
 
06:02:41.090 --> 06:02:41.100 align:start position:0%
driven by safe repairs this bill is
 
06:02:43.090 --> 06:02:43.100 align:start position:0%
actually inconsistent because it really
 
06:02:47.628 --> 06:02:47.638 align:start position:0%
uh allows an auto repair to ignore a
 
06:02:49.430 --> 06:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's procedures because it
 
06:02:51.590 --> 06:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't require that all person all
 
06:02:53.390 --> 06:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
prepares all the manufacturers
 
06:02:56.030 --> 06:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
procedures it just says if they choose
 
06:02:58.490 --> 06:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
to follow them an insurance company has
 
06:03:01.788 --> 06:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
to pay for and that means that they
 
06:03:04.430 --> 06:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
would necessarily have an incentive to
 
06:03:06.470 --> 06:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
choose the most expensive repair when an
 
06:03:10.128 --> 06:03:10.138 align:start position:0%
insurance company was paying for
 
06:03:13.310 --> 06:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
um and they frankly argue that
 
06:03:16.490 --> 06:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
the they themselves so the sole arbit of
 
06:03:19.910 --> 06:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
of repairs and the safety of cars and
 
06:03:22.970 --> 06:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
the fact is that's not true at all state
 
06:03:25.970 --> 06:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
farming 110 other insurance companies
 
06:03:28.490 --> 06:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
show their support for Highway Safety
 
06:03:30.470 --> 06:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
and the safety cars through their
 
06:03:32.990 --> 06:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
support of the Insurance Institute for
 
06:03:35.390 --> 06:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
Highway Safety uh and they're the folks
 
06:03:38.470 --> 06:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
who inform all of us about the safety of
 
06:03:40.930 --> 06:03:40.940 align:start position:0%
automobiles through independent
 
06:03:43.810 --> 06:03:43.820 align:start position:0%
scientific and educational
 
06:03:46.548 --> 06:03:46.558 align:start position:0%
organizational studies
 
06:03:46.558 --> 06:03:48.230 align:start position:0%
organizational studies
sorry

06:03:48.230 --> 06:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
06:03:51.048 --> 06:03:51.058 align:start position:0%
um so we learned from their hard work
 
06:03:55.430 --> 06:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
um and so with that uh
 
06:03:58.368 --> 06:03:58.378 align:start position:0%
there's at least some overtone that this
 
06:03:59.570 --> 06:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
bill would
 
06:03:59.580 --> 06:04:00.288 align:start position:0%
bill would
um

06:04:00.288 --> 06:04:00.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:03.170 --> 06:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
support small body shops and allow them
 
06:04:05.510 --> 06:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
to flourish I think you've heard earlier
 
06:04:07.368 --> 06:04:07.378 align:start position:0%
testimony how
 
06:04:09.708 --> 06:04:09.718 align:start position:0%
um it would there's most of the small
 
06:04:12.650 --> 06:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
body shops are not associated with
 
06:04:15.650 --> 06:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and I mean and auto
 
06:04:15.660 --> 06:04:17.330 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and I mean and auto
dealers

06:04:17.330 --> 06:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
dealers
 
06:04:19.490 --> 06:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
um it's while it may have some small
 
06:04:21.830 --> 06:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
benefit to smaller body shops it would
 
06:04:25.490 --> 06:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
have a disproportionate uh benefit to
 
06:04:28.070 --> 06:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
the larger body shops
 
06:04:30.770 --> 06:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
um and I thought that George alluded to
 
06:04:34.250 --> 06:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
you know how this bill might work and
 
06:04:37.850 --> 06:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's tied to procedures
 
06:04:41.510 --> 06:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
um and I called all data it's in all
 
06:04:44.990 --> 06:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
caps which is uh is a website that
 
06:04:47.208 --> 06:04:47.218 align:start position:0%
provides manufacturing prayer procedures
 
06:04:51.170 --> 06:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
to to the collision repair industry and
 
06:04:53.448 --> 06:04:53.458 align:start position:0%
when I asked him ask the person on the
 
06:04:54.770 --> 06:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
other under the phone the customer
 
06:04:57.230 --> 06:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
service rep how many repair procedures
 
06:04:59.390 --> 06:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
are out there he said well frankly he
 
06:05:02.090 --> 06:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
grunted and said a lot and estimated
 
06:05:05.628 --> 06:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
that their database holds 10 000 or more
 
06:05:09.650 --> 06:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
OEM procedures and I thought I would
 
06:05:13.730 --> 06:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
share with you uh a short uh slide a few
 
06:05:17.090 --> 06:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
slides that I prepared that shows you
 
06:05:20.628 --> 06:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
how these procedures play into uh the
 
06:05:22.970 --> 06:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
repair process and how it would impact
 
06:05:25.548 --> 06:05:25.558 align:start position:0%
the adjustment of a claim and the cost
 
06:05:28.250 --> 06:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
of that claim and I will try to share a
 
06:05:30.110 --> 06:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
screen right now
 
06:05:32.448 --> 06:05:32.458 align:start position:0%
I hope this is short
 
06:05:35.330 --> 06:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
and I will make it short yeah we want
 
06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
the edited verb version
 
06:05:38.638 --> 06:05:40.448 align:start position:0%
the edited verb version
okay

06:05:40.448 --> 06:05:40.458 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:05:42.770 --> 06:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
06:05:46.030 --> 06:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
this is the this is a picture of a
 
06:05:49.310 --> 06:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
2015 Altima
 
06:05:52.548 --> 06:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
um you can see in the front where the
 
06:05:54.288 --> 06:05:54.298 align:start position:0%
license plate there's some small damage
 
06:05:56.270 --> 06:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
to the license plate holder and the
 
06:05:56.280 --> 06:05:57.288 align:start position:0%
to the license plate holder and the
bumper

06:05:57.288 --> 06:05:57.298 align:start position:0%
bumper
 
06:05:59.750 --> 06:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh there's a closer shot
 
06:06:03.230 --> 06:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
of the bumper and the damage and in the
 
06:06:05.628 --> 06:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
normal course the adjuster for the
 
06:06:09.350 --> 06:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
insurance company would uh look at this
 
06:06:13.128 --> 06:06:13.138 align:start position:0%
and make a visual inspection and uh and
 
06:06:15.890 --> 06:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
decide how much it would cost just to
 
06:06:18.350 --> 06:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
fix the what's obviously broken and what
 
06:06:21.170 --> 06:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
they can see uh from with the naked eye
 
06:06:24.590 --> 06:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
but that also its industry standard that
 
06:06:27.410 --> 06:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
they would also uh allow the repair shop
 
06:06:30.830 --> 06:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
to come back and identify uh additional
 
06:06:33.530 --> 06:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
damage that was not seen by the naked
 
06:06:33.540 --> 06:06:35.330 align:start position:0%
damage that was not seen by the naked
eye

06:06:35.330 --> 06:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
eye
 
06:06:38.750 --> 06:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
um and this is a screenshot of the
 
06:06:41.690 --> 06:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
repairs and the parts and the processes
 
06:06:44.390 --> 06:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
that would be conducted uh in order to
 
06:06:46.670 --> 06:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
repair the car properly and you can see
 
06:06:51.410 --> 06:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
the cost there is 746 dollars
 
06:06:53.390 --> 06:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
um then when you start looking at the
 
06:06:56.150 --> 06:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's procedures uh you can see
 
06:06:56.160 --> 06:06:57.230 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's procedures uh you can see
that

06:06:57.230 --> 06:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:06:59.330 --> 06:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
um you know in this accident the driver
 
06:07:02.030 --> 06:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
airbag was not activated but as uh Mr
 
06:07:04.368 --> 06:07:04.378 align:start position:0%
russos mentioned you know this procedure
 
06:07:07.310 --> 06:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
would require the removal of the airbag
 
06:07:09.650 --> 06:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
and the checking of the cover and the
 
06:07:11.930 --> 06:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
terminals uh even though it's obvious
 
06:07:14.448 --> 06:07:14.458 align:start position:0%
that the damage was not so severe that
 
06:07:18.650 --> 06:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
there would be any impact on the airbag
 
06:07:20.868 --> 06:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
um and you can see further on
 
06:07:23.690 --> 06:07:23.700 align:start position:0%
where the procedure would require some
 
06:07:25.970 --> 06:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
investigation of the center pillar in a
 
06:07:28.730 --> 06:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
place that seat belt tensioner
 
06:07:30.350 --> 06:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
um you can see where it would require
 
06:07:32.948 --> 06:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
removal of a seat assembly
 
06:07:36.410 --> 06:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
and I could go on but by the time you
 
06:07:39.590 --> 06:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
end up adding up all those repairs the
 
06:07:43.310 --> 06:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
repair uh the repair estimate grows
 
06:07:46.850 --> 06:07:46.860 align:start position:0%
substantially in time and parts and the
 
06:07:49.868 --> 06:07:49.878 align:start position:0%
total cost ends up being 2
 
06:07:53.030 --> 06:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
256.26 nearly three times the current
 
06:07:57.350 --> 06:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
cost and the issue with respect to this
 
06:08:00.970 --> 06:08:00.980 align:start position:0%
bill Mr chairman is
 
06:08:04.070 --> 06:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
on the screen share
 
06:08:04.080 --> 06:08:04.788 align:start position:0%
on the screen share
um

06:08:04.788 --> 06:08:04.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:06.410 --> 06:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:08:06.420 --> 06:08:09.410 align:start position:0%
is that
you

06:08:09.410 --> 06:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:11.990 --> 06:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
all right see you did it went to your
 
06:08:15.350 --> 06:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
desktop no it did okay so um
 
06:08:16.730 --> 06:08:16.740 align:start position:0%
now you got to turn off your screen
 
06:08:16.740 --> 06:08:19.310 align:start position:0%
now you got to turn off your screen
sharing

06:08:19.310 --> 06:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:21.470 --> 06:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
all right so am I back to where I should
 
06:08:24.350 --> 06:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
be Mr chairman as far as I still see
 
06:08:25.670 --> 06:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
screen sharing you got you haven't
 
06:08:27.048 --> 06:08:27.058 align:start position:0%
turned it off
 
06:08:29.690 --> 06:08:29.700 align:start position:0%
oh I was doing pretty well for most of
 
06:08:31.570 --> 06:08:31.580 align:start position:0%
that yeah
 
06:08:36.948 --> 06:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:38.448 --> 06:08:38.458 align:start position:0%
um he should be able to do it like stop
 
06:08:43.970 --> 06:08:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:46.010 --> 06:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
do we have
 
06:08:48.650 --> 06:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
I don't see that I can stop sharing I
 
06:08:50.690 --> 06:08:50.700 align:start position:0%
can stop I see I stopped participating
 
06:08:53.208 --> 06:08:53.218 align:start position:0%
sharing oh you just cut off the ability
 
06:08:57.048 --> 06:08:57.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:59.090 --> 06:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know thank you I was just
 
06:09:01.850 --> 06:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
catching up to my end so to to wrap up
 
06:09:03.650 --> 06:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
you know I think you'd see fairly
 
06:09:06.170 --> 06:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
dramatically how you know what in one
 
06:09:08.930 --> 06:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
situation how just the blind adherents
 
06:09:11.510 --> 06:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
the procedures uh really has an
 
06:09:13.190 --> 06:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
inflationary aspect on the cost of
 
06:09:15.110 --> 06:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
repairs and if the insurance company
 
06:09:17.690 --> 06:09:17.700 align:start position:0%
does not have the ability to push back
 
06:09:21.288 --> 06:09:21.298 align:start position:0%
and reject uh these unnecessary repairs
 
06:09:23.570 --> 06:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
um the cost of that would inevitably
 
06:09:25.430 --> 06:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
flow through back to the cost of
 
06:09:28.788 --> 06:09:28.798 align:start position:0%
premiums and for this reason and for
 
06:09:31.310 --> 06:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
many others uh State Farm opposes this
 
06:09:34.548 --> 06:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
bill in any form in this idea in any
 
06:09:36.470 --> 06:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
form thank you
 
06:09:39.230 --> 06:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
thank you is anybody have any questions
 
06:09:42.970 --> 06:09:42.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:46.970 --> 06:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh seeing none thank you very much Jim
 
06:09:55.970 --> 06:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:59.510 --> 06:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
and I'll invite you to speak Andreas

06:10:24.830 --> 06:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
for giving me the opportunity to testify
 
06:10:28.490 --> 06:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
in opposition to house bill 310.
 
06:10:30.948 --> 06:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
uh LKQ is the leading provider of
 
06:10:33.350 --> 06:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
alternative and Specialty Parts repair
 
06:10:35.510 --> 06:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
and accessorize Automobiles and vehicles
 
06:10:37.628 --> 06:10:37.638 align:start position:0%
I know we got into it a little bit about
 
06:10:41.030 --> 06:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
aftermarket parts and recycled Parts
 
06:10:43.310 --> 06:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
well we're you know we're one of the
 
06:10:44.810 --> 06:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
biggest sellers of both of those
 
06:10:48.470 --> 06:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
Nationwide we have two facilities in New
 
06:10:50.570 --> 06:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one in Manchester and one in
 
06:10:50.580 --> 06:10:52.368 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one in Manchester and one in
Londonderry

06:10:52.368 --> 06:10:52.378 align:start position:0%
Londonderry
 
06:10:55.128 --> 06:10:55.138 align:start position:0%
um but I'm not going to focus on the
 
06:10:57.350 --> 06:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
part so much today is I'm going to focus
 
06:10:59.448 --> 06:10:59.458 align:start position:0%
on the scanning and calibration aspect
 
06:11:02.150 --> 06:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
of this uh through the years we've
 
06:11:05.510 --> 06:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
Diversified we own paint companies we
 
06:11:07.548 --> 06:11:07.558 align:start position:0%
own uh
 
06:11:08.930 --> 06:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
we're getting into more of the
 
06:11:13.430 --> 06:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
telematics but also uh We've also
 
06:11:15.288 --> 06:11:15.298 align:start position:0%
created a company called Elite Tech
 
06:11:19.670 --> 06:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle services now uh delete Tech is a
 
06:11:21.048 --> 06:11:21.058 align:start position:0%
scanning a mobile scanning and
 
06:11:23.330 --> 06:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
calibration company in fact we are now
 
06:11:25.850 --> 06:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
the largest U.S provider of mobile and
 
06:11:28.730 --> 06:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
on-site calibrations Diagnostics and
 
06:11:30.708 --> 06:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
programming vehicle services for fleets
 
06:11:32.330 --> 06:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
and auto repairs
 
06:11:34.310 --> 06:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
we fully support restoring repairing and
 
06:11:37.190 --> 06:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
calibrating the Adas systems which are
 
06:11:40.310 --> 06:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
your backup cameras and your lane stay
 
06:11:43.368 --> 06:11:43.378 align:start position:0%
in the lane type technology so we fully
 
06:11:45.230 --> 06:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
support repairing those to a proper
 
06:11:47.448 --> 06:11:47.458 align:start position:0%
working order and as a matter of public
 
06:11:49.670 --> 06:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
safety policy makers should encourage
 
06:11:51.708 --> 06:11:51.718 align:start position:0%
technicians insurers and vehicle owners
 
06:11:54.110 --> 06:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
to maintain those systems to the
 
06:11:56.410 --> 06:11:56.420 align:start position:0%
industry to the best industry standards
 
06:11:59.570 --> 06:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
however we support ongoing development
 
06:12:02.510 --> 06:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
for a professional certifications for
 
06:12:04.610 --> 06:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
automotive service Excellence which is
 
06:12:07.850 --> 06:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
one of these uh certifications instead
 
06:12:11.930 --> 06:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
of following uh the manufacturer's own
 
06:12:14.990 --> 06:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh procedures the issues in this bill
 
06:12:16.910 --> 06:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
have been continue to be controversial
 
06:12:20.270 --> 06:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
for those involved on all parts for a
 
06:12:22.910 --> 06:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
long time now uh it seems to address
 
06:12:25.610 --> 06:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
vehicle repair procedures as they relate
 
06:12:27.830 --> 06:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
to skin and calibrations of these Adas
 
06:12:27.840 --> 06:12:28.850 align:start position:0%
to skin and calibrations of these Adas
systems

06:12:28.850 --> 06:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
systems
 
06:12:31.128 --> 06:12:31.138 align:start position:0%
and however the use of the main word
 
06:12:33.650 --> 06:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
manufacturer recommendations inevitably
 
06:12:35.510 --> 06:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
limits innovation
 
06:12:38.030 --> 06:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
competition and impacts the type of
 
06:12:40.610 --> 06:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
parts that are used to repair vehicles
 
06:12:43.310 --> 06:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
while these Adas systems are complex the
 
06:12:44.930 --> 06:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
underlying challenge is not that
 
06:12:47.208 --> 06:12:47.218 align:start position:0%
technical in nature rather these
 
06:12:48.830 --> 06:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
automakers the oems through
 
06:12:52.208 --> 06:12:52.218 align:start position:0%
mystification and often via their
 
06:12:54.730 --> 06:12:54.740 align:start position:0%
monopolistic practices they create
 
06:12:57.230 --> 06:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
barriers to servicing and repairing
 
06:13:00.110 --> 06:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
their own products bottom line they want
 
06:13:02.750 --> 06:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
you to go to their shop using their
 
06:13:05.810 --> 06:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
equipment using their parts
 
06:13:11.030 --> 06:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
by mandating the recurs and insurers uh
 
06:13:13.970 --> 06:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
follow these these rules you'd be
 
06:13:15.830 --> 06:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
limiting many modern more efficient
 
06:13:17.948 --> 06:13:17.958 align:start position:0%
methods to scan and calibrate Vehicles
 
06:13:20.628 --> 06:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes these procedures for preparing
 
06:13:23.208 --> 06:13:23.218 align:start position:0%
a car may be 10 years old they're not
 
06:13:25.310 --> 06:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
always updated in that amount of time
 
06:13:27.890 --> 06:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
better and more efficient after-market
 
06:13:29.990 --> 06:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
tools are used to calibrate now do you
 
06:13:31.070 --> 06:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
want to
 
06:13:33.530 --> 06:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
calibrate your vehicle with a string and
 
06:13:35.270 --> 06:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
a dongle or do you want to use a lake
 
06:13:36.590 --> 06:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
you want them using the newest
 
06:13:38.750 --> 06:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
technology something that we would use
 
06:13:41.208 --> 06:13:41.218 align:start position:0%
well this Bell essentially would prevent
 
06:13:43.190 --> 06:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
us from using newer better technology
 
06:13:46.628 --> 06:13:46.638 align:start position:0%
and force us to use some outdated older
 
06:13:48.948 --> 06:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
manufacturer procedures that might not
 
06:13:51.048 --> 06:13:51.058 align:start position:0%
be the best for repairing your vehicle
 
06:13:51.058 --> 06:13:53.208 align:start position:0%
be the best for repairing your vehicle
anymore

06:13:53.208 --> 06:13:53.218 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
06:13:55.250 --> 06:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
in addition having to follow these
 
06:13:56.810 --> 06:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
recommendations will often Force
 
06:13:58.548 --> 06:13:58.558 align:start position:0%
customers to get their cars repaired at
 
06:14:02.208 --> 06:14:02.218 align:start position:0%
an oem repair shop I.E the dealer this
 
06:14:03.770 --> 06:14:03.780 align:start position:0%
instead of going to an independent
 
06:14:06.948 --> 06:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
repair these shops only use new OEM
 
06:14:08.990 --> 06:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
Parts meaning that the alternative Parts
 
06:14:11.628 --> 06:14:11.638 align:start position:0%
like recycled and aftermarket are left
 
06:14:14.208 --> 06:14:14.218 align:start position:0%
out of the loop recycled aftermarket
 
06:14:16.070 --> 06:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
parts often provide consumers with
 
06:14:18.590 --> 06:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
better warranties better prices better
 
06:14:21.230 --> 06:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
availability and the limiting these
 
06:14:23.270 --> 06:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
creates an unlevel playing field against
 
06:14:25.250 --> 06:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
the alternative Parts industry in favor
 
06:14:27.470 --> 06:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
of the car manufacturers
 
06:14:30.470 --> 06:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
without competition the oems are free to
 
06:14:32.448 --> 06:14:32.458 align:start position:0%
charge whatever they want for their
 
06:14:34.910 --> 06:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
parts and the cost of repairs and the
 
06:14:38.990 --> 06:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:40.670 --> 06:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much all I have to say I
 
06:14:42.708 --> 06:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
don't want to repeat what some of uh the
 
06:14:45.230 --> 06:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
other opponents have said but uh if
 
06:14:46.788 --> 06:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
there are any questions
 
06:14:49.128 --> 06:14:49.138 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to answer them but we we
 
06:14:51.830 --> 06:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
hope that you have heard my arguments
 
06:14:54.170 --> 06:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
and vote no on this issue it's just not
 
06:14:56.448 --> 06:14:56.458 align:start position:0%
ready to go there's a lot more going on
 
06:14:59.090 --> 06:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes than than it appears
 
06:15:02.390 --> 06:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's not about safety as we've beaten
 
06:15:04.670 --> 06:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
this to death that we're about safety
 
06:15:07.670 --> 06:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
then the men then it would be on the
 
06:15:09.708 --> 06:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
repairer to follow these procedures
 
06:15:11.930 --> 06:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
every time and then they would be on the
 
06:15:14.868 --> 06:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
hook for liability not putting it over
 
06:15:16.490 --> 06:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
to the insurers only on insurance
 
06:15:19.310 --> 06:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
repairs thank you very much
 
06:15:21.830 --> 06:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
06:15:24.770 --> 06:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee
 
06:15:27.230 --> 06:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh seeing none thank you very much for
 
06:15:29.990 --> 06:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you I have one more
 
06:15:31.970 --> 06:15:31.980 align:start position:0%

06:17:30.350 --> 06:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
presumption which technically means it's
 
06:17:32.208 --> 06:17:32.218 align:start position:0%
true unless somebody comes forward to
 
06:17:35.208 --> 06:17:35.218 align:start position:0%
contest and prove it otherwise that
 
06:17:36.590 --> 06:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
Automotive manufacturer's
 
06:17:38.030 --> 06:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations for scans and
 
06:17:39.948 --> 06:17:39.958 align:start position:0%
calibrations are necessary for vehicle
 
06:17:39.958 --> 06:17:41.330 align:start position:0%
calibrations are necessary for vehicle
repair

06:17:41.330 --> 06:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
repair
 
06:17:43.128 --> 06:17:43.138 align:start position:0%
um you know over the last 10 years
 
06:17:44.750 --> 06:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturers have been much more
 
06:17:47.330 --> 06:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
aggressive in their efforts to force
 
06:17:49.850 --> 06:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
recycled original equipment parts out of
 
06:17:51.910 --> 06:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
the market by releasing these position
 
06:17:55.250 --> 06:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
statements uh repair specifications and
 
06:17:58.070 --> 06:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
procedures that are often biased and
 
06:17:59.990 --> 06:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
based on week or no apparent scientific
 
06:18:02.570 --> 06:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
research claiming that recycled OEM
 
06:18:06.110 --> 06:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
parts are inferior to new OEM parts
 
06:18:10.070 --> 06:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh we we feel that house bill 310 is
 
06:18:12.590 --> 06:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
just another attempt to do just that uh
 
06:18:15.288 --> 06:18:15.298 align:start position:0%
we're also bothered by the references to
 
06:18:17.810 --> 06:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
the paint material guidelines uh that
 
06:18:20.628 --> 06:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
they're necessary and uh I think you've
 
06:18:23.270 --> 06:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
seen examples of how that could it could
 
06:18:26.270 --> 06:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
go awry in many many many ways so we're
 
06:18:30.410 --> 06:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
urging uh this committee uh to consider
 
06:18:32.048 --> 06:18:32.058 align:start position:0%
the consumer
 
06:18:36.350 --> 06:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
aspects of this and uh we we urgently
 
06:18:39.590 --> 06:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
oppose the uh or ask you to oppose the
 
06:18:41.990 --> 06:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
legislation today uh thank you for
 
06:18:43.850 --> 06:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
testifying or thank you for allowing me
 
06:18:46.548 --> 06:18:46.558 align:start position:0%
to testify and I do have I am a former
 
06:18:47.868 --> 06:18:47.878 align:start position:0%
Auto Recycler so if you have any
 
06:18:49.610 --> 06:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
questions for me I'll be glad to ask
 
06:18:51.470 --> 06:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
them from that perspective as well thank
 
06:18:53.628 --> 06:18:53.638 align:start position:0%
you yay
 
06:18:56.030 --> 06:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh any questions representative aberson
 
06:18:57.530 --> 06:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
06:18:59.750 --> 06:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you oh the
 
06:19:02.150 --> 06:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
video is not starting
 
06:19:03.830 --> 06:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
there you are you are can you see me now
 
06:19:07.670 --> 06:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
yes we can sorry about that uh so I've
 
06:19:09.530 --> 06:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
always thought that questions like these
 
06:19:11.628 --> 06:19:11.638 align:start position:0%
uh should be made by the consumer but
 
06:19:13.610 --> 06:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if there's some possible
 
06:19:17.208 --> 06:19:17.218 align:start position:0%
way to uh let consumers choose the
 
06:19:18.708 --> 06:19:18.718 align:start position:0%
higher priced
 
06:19:22.070 --> 06:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh option versus the uh
 
06:19:24.948 --> 06:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
allowing them to use uh allowing the
 
06:19:27.170 --> 06:19:27.180 align:start position:0%
repair facility to use uh something
 
06:19:29.750 --> 06:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
other than OEM equipment or allowing
 
06:19:32.150 --> 06:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
them to use uh recycled equipment or
 
06:19:33.350 --> 06:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
calibration you know different
 
06:19:40.190 --> 06:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:46.788 --> 06:19:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:49.430 --> 06:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
I feel it's as a consumer myself and and
 
06:19:52.128 --> 06:19:52.138 align:start position:0%
somebody who's who has many vehicles
 
06:19:55.430 --> 06:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere from a 1927 all the way up to
 
06:19:59.510 --> 06:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
2020. I can tell you that um
 
06:20:02.150 --> 06:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
our business that we had for many years
 
06:20:04.548 --> 06:20:04.558 align:start position:0%
in Albuquerque New Mexico
 
06:20:04.558 --> 06:20:05.288 align:start position:0%
in Albuquerque New Mexico
um

06:20:05.288 --> 06:20:05.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:09.170 --> 06:20:09.180 align:start position:0%
95 of our business was was wholesale so
 
06:20:10.850 --> 06:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
we went directly to the repair
 
06:20:13.368 --> 06:20:13.378 align:start position:0%
facilities that trusted us for many
 
06:20:15.890 --> 06:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
years to give them a quality product to
 
06:20:18.288 --> 06:20:18.298 align:start position:0%
return to return their uh customers
 
06:20:21.410 --> 06:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
vehicle back to pre-loss condition
 
06:20:24.470 --> 06:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
um we really never had a lot of problems
 
06:20:28.548 --> 06:20:28.558 align:start position:0%
with consumers uh choosing our parts uh
 
06:20:31.010 --> 06:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact some of my
 
06:20:34.128 --> 06:20:34.138 align:start position:0%
warranties were uh better than some of
 
06:20:36.048 --> 06:20:36.058 align:start position:0%
the OE warranty so
 
06:20:38.030 --> 06:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
um for example every part that I sold
 
06:20:40.730 --> 06:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
came with a minimum of one year parts
 
06:20:42.830 --> 06:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
and labor so if anything happened to any
 
06:20:46.610 --> 06:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
part that I sold it was replaced uh and
 
06:20:48.708 --> 06:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
and they were paid to replace that part
 
06:20:51.530 --> 06:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
so I think at the end of the day
 
06:20:51.540 --> 06:20:52.190 align:start position:0%
so I think at the end of the day
um

06:20:52.190 --> 06:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:54.470 --> 06:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know today's vehicles are are
 
06:20:56.390 --> 06:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
technically Advanced but they've been
 
06:20:59.030 --> 06:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
technically Advanced every year as as
 
06:21:01.850 --> 06:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
time has gone along so this is not the
 
06:21:04.670 --> 06:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
first time that we've uh seen some of
 
06:21:07.070 --> 06:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
these situations as as the bodies of the
 
06:21:12.368 --> 06:21:12.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:16.128 --> 06:21:16.138 align:start position:0%
okay uh any other question sure miss
 
06:21:18.470 --> 06:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
Blue Line see none thank you very much
 
06:21:20.030 --> 06:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
06:21:25.190 --> 06:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:25.200 --> 06:21:27.670 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:21:27.670 --> 06:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:21:30.470 --> 06:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh or why can't I say oh there we go
 
06:21:32.890 --> 06:21:32.900 align:start position:0%
okay Tom Tucker
 
06:21:36.170 --> 06:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm Tom I'm promoting you up to the
 
06:21:41.030 --> 06:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:48.470 --> 06:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:48.480 --> 06:21:50.990 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:21:50.990 --> 06:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:21:53.570 --> 06:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
can you hear me Mr chairman yes we can
 
06:21:57.048 --> 06:21:57.058 align:start position:0%
all right good afternoon everyone Mr
 
06:21:59.930 --> 06:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee uh my
 
06:22:01.910 --> 06:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
name is Tom Tucker I am the senior
 
06:22:04.070 --> 06:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
director of government Affairs for the
 
06:22:06.470 --> 06:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
Auto Care Association the Auto Care
 
06:22:08.330 --> 06:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
Association is a national trade
 
06:22:11.270 --> 06:22:11.280 align:start position:0%

motor vehicle parts and accessories
 
06:22:21.170 --> 06:22:21.180 align:start position:0%
tools and equipment Nationwide in short
 
06:22:23.810 --> 06:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
we represent the entire supply chain of
 
06:22:26.270 --> 06:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
the Auto industry and on behalf of the
 
06:22:27.830 --> 06:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
industry we're opposed to house bill
 
06:22:30.830 --> 06:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
310. there's a lot been said today this
 
06:22:32.330 --> 06:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
has been a very long hearing so I'm
 
06:22:34.190 --> 06:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
going to be very brief with just two
 
06:22:36.350 --> 06:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
points I'd like to make to the committee
 
06:22:40.250 --> 06:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
uh first our main issue is with Section
 
06:22:42.890 --> 06:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
e of this bill section e says in this
 
06:22:44.628 --> 06:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
paragraph manufactures recommendations
 
06:22:47.390 --> 06:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
for scans and calibrations means a
 
06:22:49.430 --> 06:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's written procedures specs
 
06:22:50.570 --> 06:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
tolerance and other technical
 
06:22:50.580 --> 06:22:52.730 align:start position:0%
tolerance and other technical
requirements

06:22:52.730 --> 06:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
06:22:56.390 --> 06:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
um as you've already heard you know when
 
06:22:58.190 --> 06:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
you start talking about manufacturer's
 
06:23:00.230 --> 06:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation and procedures you're
 
06:23:02.810 --> 06:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
really getting into it's no longer about
 
06:23:04.750 --> 06:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
safety you're you're getting into
 
06:23:08.270 --> 06:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations that uh means using OEM
 
06:23:11.750 --> 06:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
tools for scanning and calibration uh
 
06:23:11.760 --> 06:23:14.150 align:start position:0%
tools for scanning and calibration uh
representative

06:23:14.150 --> 06:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:23:16.730 --> 06:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
um I can't think of her name she's she's
 
06:23:18.230 --> 06:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
no longer on the call but she asked the
 
06:23:19.610 --> 06:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
question earlier today does this have
 
06:23:21.410 --> 06:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
anything to do with right to repair
 
06:23:25.250 --> 06:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
and uh our my colleague Scott said no
 
06:23:27.230 --> 06:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
but it actually does
 
06:23:30.470 --> 06:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
when right to repair was uh first fought
 
06:23:33.110 --> 06:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts in 2015.
 
06:23:35.510 --> 06:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
there's a National Partnership between
 
06:23:37.788 --> 06:23:37.798 align:start position:0%
the vehicle manufacturers the Auto Care
 
06:23:39.470 --> 06:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
Association where I work for and we
 
06:23:41.930 --> 06:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
represent the aftermarket that
 
06:23:44.810 --> 06:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
partnership says that beginning in model
 
06:23:48.288 --> 06:23:48.298 align:start position:0%
year 2018. the vehicle manufacturers
 
06:23:51.230 --> 06:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
must send to every tool manufacturer or
 
06:23:53.330 --> 06:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
at least make it available in the cloud
 
06:23:56.170 --> 06:23:56.180 align:start position:0%
download any information
 
06:23:58.970 --> 06:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
dealing with scan tool equipment so
 
06:24:01.368 --> 06:24:01.378 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
06:24:04.490 --> 06:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
um security security information specs
 
06:24:08.170 --> 06:24:08.180 align:start position:0%
security patches updates so the Tool uh
 
06:24:10.510 --> 06:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturers can manufacture
 
06:24:13.910 --> 06:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
aftermarket scan tools the problem is
 
06:24:17.090 --> 06:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
today that technology is moving faster
 
06:24:19.970 --> 06:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
than legislation and the regulatory
 
06:24:22.490 --> 06:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
process and so the oems have now
 
06:24:25.128 --> 06:24:25.138 align:start position:0%
installed secure gateways that now
 
06:24:27.590 --> 06:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
blocks aftermarket scan tools from
 
06:24:30.590 --> 06:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
accessing of vehicle diagnostic
 
06:24:33.288 --> 06:24:33.298 align:start position:0%
computers computer systems
 
06:24:34.548 --> 06:24:34.558 align:start position:0%
so if you don't know what a secure
 
06:24:36.530 --> 06:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
Gateway is it's nothing more than a
 
06:24:39.288 --> 06:24:39.298 align:start position:0%
cyber barrier or a checkpoint that keeps
 
06:24:41.868 --> 06:24:41.878 align:start position:0%
unauthorized traffic from entering and
 
06:24:44.510 --> 06:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
organization's Network and so this is a
 
06:24:46.788 --> 06:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
major barrier and that's what this bill
 
06:24:49.850 --> 06:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
would require that you have to use the
 
06:24:52.990 --> 06:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
OEM Network because uh the the
 
06:24:55.010 --> 06:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
aftermarket systems would be blocked
 
06:24:59.448 --> 06:24:59.458 align:start position:0%
second if independent repair shops are
 
06:25:01.548 --> 06:25:01.558 align:start position:0%
using aftermarket scan tools which many
 
06:25:03.948 --> 06:25:03.958 align:start position:0%
are and they're being blocked then the
 
06:25:06.048 --> 06:25:06.058 align:start position:0%
car is going to end up having to go back
 
06:25:09.230 --> 06:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
to the OEM franchise dealer networks and
 
06:25:10.490 --> 06:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
they're going to ultimately use OEM
 
06:25:11.990 --> 06:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
Parts which is going to raise the cost
 
06:25:14.690 --> 06:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
of the repair this has now become the
 
06:25:16.610 --> 06:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive issue that impacts
 
06:25:18.288 --> 06:25:18.298 align:start position:0%
local and small businesses in your
 
06:25:20.390 --> 06:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
communities and so I certainly would ask
 
06:25:22.128 --> 06:25:22.138 align:start position:0%
you to think about the pandemic and
 
06:25:24.288 --> 06:25:24.298 align:start position:0%
what's happening and while our industry
 
06:25:26.510 --> 06:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
has been declared essential
 
06:25:29.030 --> 06:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
most people were staying at home they
 
06:25:31.548 --> 06:25:31.558 align:start position:0%
weren't getting repairs done and so the
 
06:25:33.890 --> 06:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
impact of the industry is uh businesses
 
06:25:36.530 --> 06:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
what business was not flowing at the
 
06:25:39.890 --> 06:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
same way before the pandemic so this
 
06:25:42.350 --> 06:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
bill will ultimately hurt local and
 
06:25:45.770 --> 06:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
small businesses uh in in the State uh
 
06:25:48.530 --> 06:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
finally OEM recommendations always
 
06:25:51.708 --> 06:25:51.718 align:start position:0%
specify the use of OEM parts
 
06:25:53.868 --> 06:25:53.878 align:start position:0%
um and while this is is not outlined in
 
06:25:55.850 --> 06:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
the bill it is an unintended consequence
 
06:25:58.430 --> 06:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
of this legislation and so for these
 
06:26:00.350 --> 06:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
reasons we respectfully ask you the vote
 
06:26:02.868 --> 06:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
knowing this bill and I thank you for
 
06:26:04.490 --> 06:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
your time and I'd be more than happy to
 
06:26:06.048 --> 06:26:06.058 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that anyone may
 
06:26:06.058 --> 06:26:07.548 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that anyone may
have

06:26:07.548 --> 06:26:07.558 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:26:10.250 --> 06:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
great thank you uh is there any
 
06:26:13.368 --> 06:26:13.378 align:start position:0%
questions from any committee members
 
06:26:16.430 --> 06:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
I think they're questioned out
 
06:26:18.288 --> 06:26:18.298 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you very
 
06:26:18.298 --> 06:26:19.490 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you very
much

06:26:19.490 --> 06:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
much
 
06:26:21.770 --> 06:26:21.780 align:start position:0%
all right so I don't see any more hands
 
06:26:21.780 --> 06:26:22.570 align:start position:0%
all right so I don't see any more hands
up

06:26:22.570 --> 06:26:22.580 align:start position:0%
up
 
06:26:27.230 --> 06:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh on either side of the aisle here
 
06:26:30.110 --> 06:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
um so I guess we can uh
 
06:26:33.708 --> 06:26:33.718 align:start position:0%
wrap up the public hearing here and I
 
06:26:36.650 --> 06:26:36.660 align:start position:0%
would just note that the
 
06:26:40.548 --> 06:26:40.558 align:start position:0%
um there was five five in support 14 to
 
06:26:42.770 --> 06:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
pose and two neutral
 
06:26:45.110 --> 06:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
on the bill and with that I will close
 
06:26:49.090 --> 06:26:49.100 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill 310.
 
06:26:53.510 --> 06:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
and uh that ends our
 
06:26:56.750 --> 06:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
hearings for today
