00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
briefly the uh one one of the items in
 
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
the minutes uh was um in reference to
 
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid for schools program and
 
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
that was uh it's listed under
 
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant but I I I think
 
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
I raised it um it's no big deal in the
 
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
minutes but I just want to make sure
 
00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
since it's says that the will the the
 
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
department will be here in October or
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
November to talk about the Medicaid for
 
00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
schools program I just want to make sure
 
00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
that we're working on November so
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
because it's it's a critical issue and
 
00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
update okay I see a nodding and that's
 
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 align:start position:0%

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 align:start position:0%
pleas did we approve the minutes I think
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
so yes we did all right uh next agenda
 
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
item emerging Medical Technology study
 
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
committee annual report representative
 
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
Jess Edwards for five minutes it's not
 
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
going to take five minutes I I spoke to
 
00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
it a little bit last uh session uh what
 
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
what we ended up doing is um is having
 
00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 align:start position:0%
the inaugural meeting kind of late in
 
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
the uh in September sometimes in
 
00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
September and um since it was the first
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
meeting what we were able to do is I I I
 
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
was elected uh as the chair of that
 
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
committee uh and I got enough guidance
 
00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 align:start position:0%
from the committee so that we could put
 
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
together an annual report the annual
 
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
report didn't have much uh to say um
 
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
because uh we just had the one meeting
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
but what we did agreed to doing is to
 
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
have another um is that the the
 
00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 align:start position:0%
committee probably can deliver some
 
00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
value we're going to give it a try we
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
think our first meeting of the next term
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
is going to be sometime in February so
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
that after the election we can get and
 
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
speakership and stuff we can get uh
 
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
folks nominated to the committee um i'
 
00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
I've beg begun to reach out to various
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
speakers um I have uh I've talked to um
 
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
at least two that could come in and give
 
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
us sort of an educational overview of
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
what emerging medical technology is is
 
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
out there and how it might impact the
 
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
healthcare system and um and I intend
 
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
after the election depending on the
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
results to write a letter to um the the
 
00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
the the the military agency that handles
 
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
Advanced Medical Technology emerging
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
medical technology to see if we can
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
establish some kind of a relationship
 
00:06:59.309 --> 00:06:59.319 align:start position:0%
with them so uh the hope of all of this
 
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
is is that if nothing else we gain some
 
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
more subject matter expertise within the
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
legislature so that we understand the
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
potential of emerging medical technology
 
00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
and what the implications are for uh
 
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
clinical trials and use here in the
 
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
state um and whether or not we need
 
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation to be in a position
 
00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
to consider it intelligently before it's
 
00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
too late in the process um and um and
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
and and that's sort of the this the hope
 
00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
uh coincidentally uh Representative
 
00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
Keith Ammon is trying to get a caucus
 
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
together to talk about emerging
 
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
technology in general without it having
 
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
the medical stove pipe to it and so I've
 
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
told them I'd be interested in
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
participating in that caucus um and uh
 
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
there may be a good deal of correlation
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
between them so so that's uh that's
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
that's my report I um we'll we we'll see
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
who's going to be involved
 
00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:04.759 align:start position:0%
come um post election um so that's all
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
if there are any questions I'll answer
 
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
them any
 
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you seeing
 
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:12.280 align:start position:0%

make the presentation on behalf of the
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner's update this morning my
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
name is Ellen Le Point and I am the CEO
 
00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:46.519 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire hospital and I am going
 
00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
to be sharing with you today you you
 
00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
have a slide deck um they it looks like
 
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
two slides per page you got it um and
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
I'll be reviewing this presentation with
 
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
you it's in regards to our high security
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
unit at New Hampshire hospital and I
 
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
want to create some clarity right from
 
00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959 align:start position:0%
the beginning because I'm using a phrase
 
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
um high security as opposed to the
 
00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
phrase forensic and I'd like to talk a
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
little bit more about why that is later
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
on in the presentation but just wanted
 
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that everyone knew I was
 
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
talking about the construction project
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
that's currently occurring at New
 
00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:25.310 align:start position:0%
that's currently occurring at New
Hampshire

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
hospital uh the the the size of of the
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
unit is uh 24 bits and that is in
 
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
parallel to the size of our existing
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
units the majority of our existing units
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire hospital so it's really
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
an additional unit that's going to be
 
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
added to the hospital there is some
 
00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
other components of this particular unit
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
given the population that it will serve
 
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
that does make it larger than our
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
current units um there are some specific
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
recreational areas for the patient
 
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
population that it will be
 
00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
serving and again just to create Clarity
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
that this will be attached to New
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital it's not going to be
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
on the side of the hospital it will be
 
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
attached to our existing structure as
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
well as the intent to have it be
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
accredited through the Joint Commission
 
00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
who the hospital is accredited with
 
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
currently and will not require a
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
separate accreditation in order to serve
 
00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.389 align:start position:0%
separate accreditation in order to serve
this

00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
population um so I'll go to the first
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
slide which is the agenda and we'll be
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
talking briefly just to keep you all
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
apprized that we have had several
 
00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:35.959 align:start position:0%
community outreach sessions to keep the
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
community informed of the progress today
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
we'll also be discussing how those
 
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
Outreach sessions can be accessed online
 
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
should you choose to view them and we'll
 
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
be talking about briefly about the
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
design of the unit the construction
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
timeline why we're building this unit
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
the patient population it will serve
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
some brief construction updates and also
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
some architectural renderings and this
 
00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
slide that you see in front of you that
 
00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:03.639 align:start position:0%
has the agenda on it also has a picture
 
00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:05.959 align:start position:0%
of the rendering um that was provided to
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
us by the
 
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
architect so the next slide is in
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
regards to the community outreach
 
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
sessions we've had six community
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
outreach sessions so far being held from
 
00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
October of
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
2021 through August 29th was our most
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
recent of 2024 to inform the public
 
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
those sessions have been well attended
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
they were more highly attended
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
in um the initial stages of the Outreach
 
00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:35.959 align:start position:0%
to the community our most recent session
 
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:39.160 align:start position:0%
had about a dozen participants yet still
 
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
some very informative questions and
 
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
ability to continue to create clarity
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
about the project so we've been pleased
 
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
with those sessions so
 
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:49.720 align:start position:0%
far according to our pre-established
 
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
timeline we do have at least one
 
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
additional community outreach session
 
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
that's scheduled for this early summer
 
00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
of next year 2025 however it's highly
 
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
likely that we will schedule additional
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
sessions as
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
well and you can see on there of course
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
the DHHS website if you wanted to view
 
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
or listen to any of the community
 
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
outreach sessions that have occurred so
 
00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
far they all were
 
00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
recorded and also include um copies of
 
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:19.240 align:start position:0%
the slide decks in
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
PDF uh next slide again just a little
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
bit more clarity as to where those
 
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
sessions can be found and we have
 
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
continuously provided this contacted
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
information it's the New Hampshire
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
Hospital's admin support mailbox so that
 
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
individuals who are viewing these
 
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
sessions or should happen to view them
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
after they occurred would still be able
 
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
to outreach to us should they have any
 
00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
questions and that has occurred I have
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
had folks reach out and we've been able
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
to create clarity as we've
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
progressed next slide you'll see the
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
construction time the design and
 
00:12:55.949 --> 00:12:55.959 align:start position:0%
construction timeline so of course
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
across the top you'll see the years that
 
00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
we've been uh
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
pretty kneed deep in this work although
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
many years prior to uh get us to this
 
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
point and the uh next swim Lane is the
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
quarters or corresponding quarters or
 
00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
months of those years so you can see we
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
are moving to the far right hand side of
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
the current timeline in quarter 3 of
 
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
2024 that yellow circle indicates the
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
August Outreach session that just
 
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
occurred and you can see below that we
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
are kneed deep in our construction
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
currently I'm sure that this timeline
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
will continue to get updated as time
 
00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:36.279 align:start position:0%
progresses but it's our current our most
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
currently sure yeah we can take
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
questions during the representative
 
00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
Edwards thank you so looking at the
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
Timeline it implies that uh you'll be
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
open for business at the end of Q2 of
 
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
2025 or or what is the projected
 
00:13:58.189 --> 00:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
completion date the projected completion
 
00:13:59.949 --> 00:13:59.959 align:start position:0%
date at this point we are still
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
approximately two years away from being
 
00:14:05.749 --> 00:14:05.759 align:start position:0%
able to occupy the facility I anticipate
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
that formal construction will be
 
00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
completed by the end of
 
00:14:12.749 --> 00:14:12.759 align:start position:0%
2026 based on the current timeline as
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
provided by the construction company
 
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
however that doesn't necessarily
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
immediately equate to occupancy because
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
there are permit processes that we have
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
to go through Fire Marshall checks it
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that we need to make sure
 
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
is present all of those internal
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
components that need to be in place
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
prior to occupancy right okay so so that
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
would be good for a future update to
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
know what our what we're expecting right
 
00:14:41.069 --> 00:14:41.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and then the may I and
 
00:14:43.629 --> 00:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
and so the two big questions typically
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
on something like this is uh are we on
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
time and are we on budget and I I I I
 
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
suspect we're not on time because of uh
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
some of the groundwater issues that we
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
ran into um that probably didn't help
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
the budget either though so so what how
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
are we from a budget perspective and
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
where's the money coming from the
 
00:15:04.829 --> 00:15:04.839 align:start position:0%
additional money thankfully from a
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
budget perspective we are aligned still
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
um I haven't heard otherwise from the
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
construction team or the architect or
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
the Department of Public Works we did
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
take longer than originally anticipated
 
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to perform the uh
 
00:15:23.949 --> 00:15:23.959 align:start position:0%
foundational work that has currently
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
occurred however I'm under the
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
impression that all of that timeline was
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
built in to our most recent uh budget
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
allocation for the work of course as
 
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
they continue to progress and continue
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
to dig um that may change but in it in
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
its current state I'm not we're not
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
concerned about the budget currently all
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
right thank you and thank you Mr
 
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
chair Senator Rosenwald thank you thank
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair good morning I just want to
 
00:15:57.069 --> 00:15:57.079 align:start position:0%
confirm that when this is open the
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
patients who are currently at the spu
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
moved thank you for the question Senator
 
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
Rosen Wald so that actually goes to the
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
point a bit that I'll um elaborate on a
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
little bit further in the presentation
 
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
but you're accurate the patient
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
population that we aim to serve
 
00:16:20.309 --> 00:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
immediately upon opening of the facility
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
will be the Civil committed individuals
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
you uh um okay if the current population
 
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
at sbu is going here who's going to
 
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.150 align:start position:0%
at sbu is going here who's going to
Hamstead

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
Hamstead
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
this correct got it thank
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
you so speaking of the patient
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
population um is our next slide and
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
there are primarily three patient
 
00:16:50.829 --> 00:16:50.839 align:start position:0%
populations who are going to be
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
considered for this unit and those are
 
00:16:55.309 --> 00:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
patients who have not committed an
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
unlawful act but because of their mental
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
illness are too dangerous to be treated
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
at a conventional Psychiatric Hospital
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
those are the primary members who will
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
be transitioning from the spu who are
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
essentially civy committed currently to
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
that location but are New Hampshire
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
hospital patients so they'll be
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
returning to us as I understand in the
 
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
current state there are approximately 22
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
of those individuals currently at spu
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
and just a reminder that this unit will
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
have an occupancy of 24
 
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
other patient populations are patients
 
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
who are involved in the criminal justice
 
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
system and suffering from a serious
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
mental illness and are actively
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
dangerous to themselves or
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
others in the third patient population
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
are patients who are accused of an
 
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
unlawful act but cannot go to trial
 
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
because of their illness and are acutely
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
dangerous to themselves or others or
 
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
incompetent to stand trial so I wanted
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
to take a moment here may I jump in at
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
that point please House built 1020
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
established a committee to look at
 
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
restoration to competency I was elected
 
00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
chairman of that we finished our first
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
year initial report because the bill
 
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
takes us into
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
2025 where looking at various ways where
 
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
restoration to competency can actually
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
be attempted intentionally because right
 
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
now if it happens it because it happens
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
um we
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
expressed Wonder as to to what degree
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
could this Center assist in restoration
 
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
of Competency we left it open because we
 
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to have a more of a conversation
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
which we hadn't had so I said then let's
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
not presume it but that's a conversation
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
we would like to have uh do you have any
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
thoughts going forward about that sure
 
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
representative um I think
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
that it might pose challenges to
 
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
consider that this unit would have the
 
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
ability to restore competency and that's
 
00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
for a couple of reasons one is that the
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
primary focus of both the department and
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital is to keep the
 
00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
patient in the center of our decision-
 
00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
making and our treatment in terms of
 
00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:23.799 align:start position:0%
Competency restoration the client in
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
those circumstances is primarily the
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
court system so it's not that that New
 
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital uh wouldn't be able
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
to treat these individuals and
 
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
competency may be able to be achieved
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
through that treatment however if you
 
00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
make the distinction that uh competency
 
00:19:44.909 --> 00:19:44.919 align:start position:0%
restoration belongs to New Hampshire
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
hospital or to the department it's not
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
quite in alignment with the Department's
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
mission in terms of serving the patient
 
00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
function senator rosenal
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman of the
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
22 current patients at the
 
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
spu are any of them from the county
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
jails yes I don't know the number off
 
00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
hand but yes that would be accurate okay
 
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.950 align:start position:0%
hand but yes that would be accurate okay
thank

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
you and let me follow up on mine um
 
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
while I was writing down I thank you for
 
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
that give me time to write it down
 
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
um where it exists
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
restoration of competence he an orphan
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
yeah and we are examining other states
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
to see who would be a good adoptive
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
parent to this in Haller part but uh
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could have a chat at some
 
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
point after the first of the year yeah
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy too thank you Mr chair
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
representative we had a question I'm
 
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
just curious this phrase means because I
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know what this restoration
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
mhm so for the chair are we talking
 
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.549 align:start position:0%
mhm so for the chair are we talking
about

00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
restoring people who are in uh group
 
00:21:15.789 --> 00:21:15.799 align:start position:0%
three so people accused of an unlawful
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
act but could not go to trial because of
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
their illness because of their lack of
 
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
Competency is that yes they're not able
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
consciously intentionally to assist in
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
their own defense right and so I just
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to express my
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
concern that going
 
00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
forward my my concern about the
 
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
conflation of
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
treatment and I think I'm speaking
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
mostly about the same thing you are but
 
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
there's there's a complete difference
 
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
between treatment as a therapeutic thing
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
and treatment for the purpose of
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
rendering somebody liable to punishment
 
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
and I think that if we are trying to
 
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
blend them in the same blender we're
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
going down a slippery slope that I would
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
be very sorry to see us go down and I
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
also think that um you know there are
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
things that lead to lack of Competency
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
that can be treated I mean the obvious
 
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
one I think of is malnutrition or an
 
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
underlying untreated medical condition
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
but beyond
 
00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:30.919 align:start position:0%
that um the reasons for incompetence are
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
so Myriad that um having that as a
 
00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
treatment goal seems to me to be very
 
00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:42.039 align:start position:0%
very problematical in many senses and I
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
know you're already studying that I just
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
wanted to get that on the record in this
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
hearing uh because I think that's
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
probably a rabbit hole we don't want to
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
go down right now no we have other
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
things to do but for the purposes of our
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
committee we have examined that and the
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh contos of is it ethical even to treat
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
somebody so they can stand trial on the
 
00:23:09.149 --> 00:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
other hand contos that is what about
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
Justice for the individuals what about
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
people who um are let out but have not
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
faced uh a judge we're aware of all of
 
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
that which is why I'm grateful we have
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
another whole year to play with that
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you okay keep
 
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
going oh sorry representative Merchant
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm trying to do
 
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
understand the difference between
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
treatment versus housing um and what I'm
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
not sure of yet is that if they're
 
00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
coming into the facility for
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
treatment how is that different because
 
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
the length of state has a lot to do with
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
occupancy as far as capacity M so if
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to be there for just the
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
treatment for a relatively short period
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
of time until either they go to trial go
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
on to some of facility if it becomes
 
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
more of a housing issue and they're
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
there for a
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
longterm what happens s to the capacity
 
00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
the ability to take on more
 
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
incoming U patients if you will my
 
00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
concern is the capacity issue between
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
coming in and staying there sure thank
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
you for the question but just to create
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
Clarity are you speaking specifically
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
about this unit or New Hampshire
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
hospital as a whole this particular unit
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
is that if they stay there for too long
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
of a period of time and they don't move
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
on then at that point in time we have a
 
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
log Jam agreed thank you for the
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
question it's definitely uh an important
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
one and something that should be
 
00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
considered because although I'm not a
 
00:24:35.389 --> 00:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
clinician I do understand that being
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
able to effectively treat this
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
population of individuals will take a
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
longer length of time than the the let's
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
say standard uh for for lack of a better
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
phrase patient that we treat currently
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire Hospital's existing
 
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
state so I I do think that um although
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
discharge planning is the primary goal
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
for all of our patients it will take
 
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
some additional time to treat this
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
patient population and we have to be
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
mindful of that given that it is only a
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
24 bed
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
unit representative Weber yeah follow up
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
first let let oh okay thank you thank
 
00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.389 align:start position:0%
first let let oh okay thank you thank
you

00:25:14.389 --> 00:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
Mr given the fact that there is a
 
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
capacity that we have to stay within
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
because it's only 24
 
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
beds what happens if we don't have the
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
ability to take in more patients what
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
where do they go how does the system
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
going to handle that issue if there's a
 
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
bottleneck there and then all of a
 
00:25:34.389 --> 00:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
sudden we have situation where back to
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
holding up other components because if
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
you think about at least I'm thinking
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
about it through there's different
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
grades of what you have to deal with
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
some can go to the hospital some have to
 
00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
go to the security Center um high
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
capacity or high security so what's the
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
plan if we have a bottleneck there how
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
do we deal with it again thank you I
 
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
think it's a great question and it is
 
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
questions that we've been asking
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
ourselves in trying to collaborate with
 
00:26:00.389 --> 00:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh the department of corrections to come
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
up with the best solution I will say
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
though that one of the things about this
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
model that we hope to be very beneficial
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
in that regard is the fact that it is
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
attached to New Hampshire hospital and
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
if in a point in time any of the 24
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
individuals residing in the high
 
00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
security space are stabilized enough
 
00:26:20.669 --> 00:26:20.679 align:start position:0%
that they can transition into New
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital's current civil
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
locations or units that we would have
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
the flexibility to do so and therefore
 
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
open up beds in the high security
 
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
space representative Weber and I guess
 
00:26:38.669 --> 00:26:38.679 align:start position:0%
my my question was the same from the
 
00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
opposite point of view we have a
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
population approximately the same size
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
right now at the
 
00:26:49.389 --> 00:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
spu and presumably that is subject to
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
the same kinds of considerations and
 
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
bottlenecks what we're doing is
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
transferring a present population from
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
one locality to another
 
00:27:05.789 --> 00:27:05.799 align:start position:0%
locality and yes all of those issues are
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
the same but they are the same issues
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
that we're currently dealing with in a
 
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
far less appropriate environment and so
 
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
let us all my comment would be let us
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
all hope that uh transferring to a more
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
therapeutically appropriate environment
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
might help actually releas some of that
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
bottleneck but understanding that these
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
are particularly difficult persons to
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
treat correct thank you for that um and
 
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
and I would completely agree although
 
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
the this plan won't necessarily add a
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of relief to capacity
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
in the overall system it is
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
transitioning individuals to a more
 
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
therapeutic environment and although the
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
spu works very hard and has some
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
wonderful people um employed there think
 
00:27:59.310 --> 00:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
and I've had the opportunity to visit
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
and collaborate with them especially in
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
the more recent months as we plan for
 
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
this unit um it's not a healthcare
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
environment so this is transitioning the
 
00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:09.519 align:start position:0%
population to a more therapeutic
 
00:28:12.029 --> 00:28:12.039 align:start position:0%
environment and as representative Weber
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
indicated in hopes that it will
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
perpetuate their ability to heal and
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
become more stabilized therefore helping
 
00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.389 --> 00:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
throughput um so if I could just pause
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
for a second although it's not on the
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
slide I did think that this was a good
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to create a little bit more
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
clarity around the term forensic so I
 
00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:34.519 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure folks
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
understood that forens the term forensic
 
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
is a bit of a misnomer in terms of the
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
plan that I just described for this unit
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
there was a previous iteration of the
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
plan that included upwards of 60 beds
 
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
for this build we were able to receive
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
funding to have 24 bits so the intention
 
00:28:58.990 --> 00:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
of this unit really is going to be
 
00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:02.519 align:start position:0%
transitioning those 22 patients from spu
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
who are essentially civil committed in
 
00:29:06.669 --> 00:29:06.679 align:start position:0%
Corrections into a healthcare
 
00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
environment those individuals may or may
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
not have forensic
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
involvement and currently in New
 
00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:15.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital's current state we
 
00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:17.799 align:start position:0%
treat forensic patients all the time
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the hospital um so using the
 
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
term forensic for this unit isn't
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
necessarily the most accurate
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
description of the individuals who will
 
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
okay yes so yeah representative Edwards
 
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so so that just gets
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
my mind wandering between potential
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
disconnect between the enabling law at
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
60 beds for forensic hospital and what
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
we're actually going to do and how we're
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're complying with
 
00:30:00.669 --> 00:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
the law or we're changing the law is and
 
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
maybe you're not the right one to ask
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
but I i' I'd like to know if we need to
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
do anything to tweak the law so that
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
we're not breaking the law in this
 
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
transition thank you for asking that
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
question and I'm happy to take that back
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
we have been looking at that especially
 
00:30:18.669 --> 00:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
as I said in the more recent months
 
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
because we've sort of gotten to this
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
point in our operational planning as we
 
00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:24.519 align:start position:0%
collaborate with the Department of
 
00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:27.519 align:start position:0%
Corrections and DHHS in the population
 
00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919 align:start position:0%
that will initially serving that it does
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's it's not the full 60 right
 
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
it's 24 and in the priority are the
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
individuals who are civil committed who
 
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
may or may not be forensic individuals
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
so um there is work happening behind the
 
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
scenes to make sure that all of that is
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
aligned and well intended in terms of um
 
00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:52.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
law followup and just to make it clear I
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
I I I'm just anticipating
 
00:31:01.629 --> 00:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
somebody someday wanting to sue us and I
 
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
would just like us to be uh
 
00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
operationally in compliance with the law
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
so that there's less less window of
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
vulnerability there agreed thank you I
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
would like that as
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
well Senator did you have your hand up
 
00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
would you like to have it up again thank
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman um couple
 
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
things one I think the term forensic
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
hospital was the department ments so
 
00:31:33.629 --> 00:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't us telling the department what to
 
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
call this place it was the
 
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
department telling us what it was and
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
the key point I think was Hospital
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
rather than basically cages in the
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
basement of the Men's prison um
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
secondly um when the
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
department proposed a 60 bed Hospital
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of
 
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
concern in the
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
legislature that it would
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
just uh well when beds exist they get
 
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
filled and there was a lot of concern
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
that the counties would be
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
sending difficult patients who they
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
didn't want to have to deal with and put
 
00:32:28.629 --> 00:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
them in the state's care and so building
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
a 24 bed unit was very
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
intentional on the legislator's part
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
like there was a need for 60 beds and we
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
just said too bad you can't have them we
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
looked at the population over the years
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
spu and found that 24 beds was really
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
reasonable and 60 beds was way too much
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
and way too much money that we didn't
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you Senator I definitely
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate those comments and by no
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
means um in bringing up the 60 beds was
 
00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:18.919 align:start position:0%
it was it meant to insinuate that we
 
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily get what we asked for
 
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
but just to create the clarity around
 
00:33:26.669 --> 00:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
the forensic component of the population
 
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
that will be served and and your
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
original Point as well uh it probably
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
was it was before my time actually
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
significantly before my time I think I
 
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
had documentation in my office um
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
talking about the need for this addition
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
from like the 1970s um so this has been
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
in conversation for quite some time and
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
the term forensic was used back then as
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
well so um hopefully um we can just
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
continue to help support and creating
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
Clarity around the intention of the
 
00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.990 align:start position:0%
Clarity around the intention of the
space

00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
space
 
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
follow up make one more comment on one
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
of your slides you refer to it as the
 
00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
forensic hospital when you talk about
 
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
the public outage
 
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
so um there seems like the department
 
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.389 align:start position:0%
so um there seems like the department
still

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
conflicted about what to call it thank
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
you for that so I did notice that on the
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
slide and the reason why I didn't change
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
the phrase on that particular slide is
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
cuz that's still the pathway on the
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
website uh for DHA HS and we haven't yet
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
updated that pathway to more accurate
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
language um but but otherwise I think I
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
I corrected it in the other slides but I
 
00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that feedback that it does
 
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.109 --> 00:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
confusion all right um so design review
 
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
I'll go through this one quick um so I
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned the 24 beds the design as per
 
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
the architect company um does allow for
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
additional beds to be added at a future
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
State should there be some level of
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
assessment or determine need at some
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
point in the in the future um the as I
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned design location is adjacent to
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital that will help
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
allow for efficiency economies of scale
 
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
access to Specialty and access to
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
Specialty Services that we do currently
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
provide and of course the design Focus
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
secure this issue comes up with the
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
Hamstead and the YDC and so I just want
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're we're okay in
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
this regard between the New Hampshire
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
hospital and the the new unit uh is is
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
the um the access between the buildings
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
is through a an interior secure Corridor
 
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
suitable for the movement of people in
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
the winter and rain and okay yes
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
entirely accurate it's completely
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
attached to the Hospital there will be
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
no need to transition to Outdoors or any
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
type of risk um for those patients to to
 
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
make that transition so so that's
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
outstanding because that's the way the
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
YDC needs to be um so uh but it's not
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
right now but thank
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
you um so the next couple of slides are
 
00:36:20.109 --> 00:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
really uh pictures to give you a little
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
bit more in-depth view of what we're
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
doing so the site selection you can see
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
a bird's eyee view of New Hampshire
 
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
hospital and where this new build is
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
occurring and then the next three slides
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
I believe are pictures of current
 
00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
progress that I'll walk through with you
 
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
and I actually took these pictures uh
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
primarily from my office on Wednesday of
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
this week so just two days ago um the
 
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
one that you'll see at the end is from
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
someone else's office a little further
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
down the line but the first picture you
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
can see where there's two green
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
dumpsters in the lower um right hand
 
00:36:59.550 --> 00:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
corner that is the pad where the
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
generator will be going and that's work
 
00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
that they just did more recently you can
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
see that they really um dug into that
 
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
Hillside to create the space for that
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
generator and um then you can see the
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
corner of the loading dock again in the
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
lower right hand side that's the
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
existing New Hampshire hospital loaded
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
loading dock but they did uh recently do
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
that work in that space as well to
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
create um a little bit more
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
stability and then sliding if you can
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
imagine towards the right this is the
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
current state of construction that we
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
have right now um this is just one
 
00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
section of the footprint of this new
 
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
build the next picture you'll be able to
 
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
see that they are starting digging in um
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
another location um but this we were
 
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
sort of really excited to see because
 
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
over the past year or so we've seen a
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
lot of dirt moving around with with
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
purpose we're sure but as non-engineers
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
it's hard to understand until we were
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
able to see some rebar and concrete come
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
to fruition so that's been really
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
exciting and then as I mentioned this
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
last picture is further to Sliding
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
further to the right and um them
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
broadening that footprint of the new
 
00:38:17.069 --> 00:38:17.079 align:start position:0%
construction and then the remaining
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
remaining two slides as I mentioned are
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
renderings that smrt the architect firm
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
has provided for us this first rendering
 
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
is when you drive into the the current
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
entry point to New Hampshire hospital
 
00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:32.839 align:start position:0%
you can see the on the left hand side
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
that is um the existing New Hampshire
 
00:38:37.309 --> 00:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
hospital and then on the right hand side
 
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
where you can see um an outside uh um
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
space for patient activity that has a
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
wall and you can see kind of that
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
mixture of green and tan that is the uh
 
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
new construction that's currently being
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
built yes representative
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
Weber just reminding you that we have
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
black and white white slides oh I'm so
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
sorry of course you do I apologize but
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
hopefully it made sense still I just
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
thought it was really
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
great thank you I'm looking at color
 
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
me representative
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
Edwards okay so we already have talked
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
about the parking problem and that this
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
is going to exacerbate it what are you
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
thinking these days about uh addressing
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
the employee and visitor parking issues
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question so the
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
parking uh well despite the winter
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
months coming um the parking shouldn't
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
get much worse than the current state um
 
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
so that's a win right um you know
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
barring significant snow this winter
 
00:39:42.309 --> 00:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
that that always makes parking
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
challenging on the campus however I do
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
um feel good about the support of the
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
campus broadly and that some folks have
 
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
really myself included um taken to
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
parking further away to get in a few
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
extra steps so it has manageable um on
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
any given day depending if there are a
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
number of remote employees um working
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
across the campus that's offered relief
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
of course New Hampshire hospital staff
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
are not remote but um have been willing
 
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
more so that was very nice but you said
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
that there is no
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
new there is no new proposal that I'm
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
aware of to increase parking
 
00:40:24.599 --> 00:40:25.750 align:start position:0%
aware of to increase parking
representative

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
question it's it's true with was said
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
before that if you add hospital beds
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
across the state you're going to fill
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
them up that just happens it's like a
 
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:40.839 align:start position:0%
void almost that just gets filled up so
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
my question is relative to the 20 versus
 
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079 align:start position:0%
the 64 or the 60 versus the 24 beds do
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
you feel that we are going to be taking
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
care of our patient the population
 
00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
you're describing in the state of New
 
00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire throughout the system are we
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
going to be able to take care of those
 
00:40:59.470 --> 00:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
patient as
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
well yes I sincerely hope so um I feel
 
00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
like uh New Hampshire hospital no matter
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
how many patients we have and of course
 
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm uh unbiased but does a
 
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
tremendous job so we they consistently
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
rise to the challenge in terms of
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
meeting the need um in terms of overall
 
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
capacity I'm not entirely sure yet um I
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
think we kind of have to see where
 
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:31.839 align:start position:0%
things go follow follow up thank you uh
 
00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
so my my question to go further is only
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
that and I I I imagine and I believe
 
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire hospital is doing a
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
great job thank you and I also believe
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
that you know no matter how many beds we
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
build they will be filled and you'll be
 
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
at capacity before you know it that just
 
00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
happens so what is the downward pressure
 
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
going to be on the counties you know if
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
if we are not able to house the patient
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
presentation I'm not sure that's a
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
question I'm prepared to answer today
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
okay simple question then is this going
 
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
to be the additional um uh units will
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
that be a vertical or horizontal build
 
00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
horizontal horizontal okay correct will
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
that impact parking it already has
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
impacted parking they've fenced off the
 
00:42:23.309 --> 00:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
entirety of that yellow outline space
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
you can't see yellow um but the space um
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
on that bir eye view of the hospital so
 
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
it has it has significantly impacted
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
parking already thank
 
00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:38.079 align:start position:0%
you so Senator Rosenwald thank you Mr
 
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:41.720 align:start position:0%
chair so representative Edwards and I
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
both sit on the fisal committee and um
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
even just last week we approved more
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
funding for transitional housing as the
 
00:42:59.470 --> 00:42:59.480 align:start position:0%
backo way out of New Hampshire hospital
 
00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
so people who don't need Hospital level
 
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
care anymore but can't be safely
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
discharged just right back out to the
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
community I mean aren't we managing both
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
the front door and the back
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
door with all of the arpa funds that we
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
have committed and moving forward with
 
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
this new high security Hospital
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Senator and
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
and um it's an entirely uh great
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
question yes the answer to that is yes
 
00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your support in terms
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
of Housing and funding allocation
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
because you're entirely correct that
 
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
from a systemwide perspective there's
 
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
been a tremendous amount of work to
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
create relief to um transitioning folks
 
00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
out of the acute care environment back
 
00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
into community so not just specific to
 
00:43:56.589 --> 00:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
this unit but of course they work with
 
00:43:56.599 --> 00:43:57.750 align:start position:0%
this unit but of course they work with
mission

00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
mission
 
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from kach and Julianne about
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
the tenure Mental Health Plan update
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
today um so a tremendous amount of
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
effort is going into offering some
 
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
relief representative Weber and just to
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
beat the parking issue to death um am I
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
correct in thinking that some of the
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
stresses at the moment are because of
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
00:44:22.109 --> 00:44:22.119 align:start position:0%
construction and so when the
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
construction is complete and the fencing
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's required for safety
 
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
um and movement of equipment and all the
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
rest of it is down will the parking be
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
adequate at that point thank you for the
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
question I I know that you're that is
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
correct that there will be some
 
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
additional relief offered based on the
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh footprint right now of the
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
construction there are construction
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
vehicles there's construction traffic
 
00:44:49.599 --> 00:44:51.069 align:start position:0%
vehicles there's construction traffic
there's

00:44:51.069 --> 00:44:51.079 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
construction materials um so I do
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
believe that we'll be able to get
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
additional parking spaces back once all
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
of that work is done I'm not I'm not
 
00:45:03.069 --> 00:45:03.079 align:start position:0%
entirely sure that it will be sufficient
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
enough especially with the intent of
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
adding additional staff members to
 
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
support this new unit however um we will
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
be able to obtain some additional spots
 
00:45:17.549 --> 00:45:17.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
you my last slide is just additional
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your report
 
00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
chair our recognizers Henry Lipman for
 
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enhancement uh for children and
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:02.200 align:start position:0%
also good morning again Henry lman for
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
the record State Medicaid director would
 
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
you like to have Sarah come up too sure
 
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
okay because I think the first report's
 
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
pretty short U I think you have it
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
electronically from from John Williams I
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
think I highlighted in green basically
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
the the change which is we now have one
 
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
year worth of um information in terms of
 
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
the number of women that were able to
 
00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:27.559 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the
 
00:46:27.559 --> 00:46:29.470 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the
expanded

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
expanded
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
um um postpartum coverage from 60 days
 
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
to a year and that was
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
381 um women were able to take advantage
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
of that um that began October 1 of 2023
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
we're still in the unwind period um the
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
tail end of the unwind period so you
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
know the number could be a little bit
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
higher in the next year now that we've
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
got basically a Year's worth of
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
experience we allow for some claim
 
00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
runout which is typically we allow six
 
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
months to get a you know a more complete
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
picture next report I'd like to come
 
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
back with some you know what what do we
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
see from metrics that would indicate
 
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
that the benefits that were used and I
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
think it'll take a little longer to look
 
00:47:16.589 --> 00:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
at the health outcomes component of it
 
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
but those are things that we're going to
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
build upon with each um subsequent
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
report I take any questions on that
 
00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:30.710 align:start position:0%
report I take any questions on that
component

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
the second part of the uh required
 
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
reporting is basically what we did to
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
ensure that um home health benefits
 
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
weren't restricted I think in the prior
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
report uh there's really no change we
 
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
made the legislative changes required in
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
22 um through Rule and uh I
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
not um from constituent standpoint I've
 
00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
not received concerns about how that's
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
working if if you've heard any issues on
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
that I'd love to hear those um but I
 
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
think we've got that issue sort of in
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
place um and you know um I suppose over
 
00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
time we could look at try to bring back
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
some metrics in terms of what the
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
differen is that's making in the health
 
00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
of our population but I think that's um
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
something that we could um build into uh
 
00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:25.270 align:start position:0%
something that we could um build into uh
future

00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
reporting any questions on this for Mr
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
Lipman or Dr
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
fny representative Edwards uh thank you
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh I'm just um again just
 
00:48:39.309 --> 00:48:39.319 align:start position:0%
thinking General thoughts and I'm I'm
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
wondering about the utility of this
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
report going forward do do you think
 
00:48:47.069 --> 00:48:47.079 align:start position:0%
we're always going to need this
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
quarterly report or do you see uh Sunset
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
I I hate to just keep adding
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
requirements to the department and never
 
00:48:58.349 --> 00:48:58.359 align:start position:0%
take any away I'm so glad you asked that
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
question it was your body language I
 
00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
could feel it no I I would like to
 
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
report to you because on the postpartum
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
part of it because I think that you what
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
we were looking to see was that it made
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
a difference in in outcomes for um you
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
know the concerns about what happens um
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
to our population um with uh either
 
00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:21.799 align:start position:0%
mental health issues you know postart
 
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
depression you know um you know part of
 
00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:26.799 align:start position:0%
the initiative to produce this
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
legislation I think uh was you know what
 
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
we've seen in terms of very unfortunate
 
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances you know I think there
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
were people who even came to the table
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
to testify who had family members who
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
had committed suicide Post delivery we
 
00:49:42.789 --> 00:49:42.799 align:start position:0%
also know that um cardiovascular
 
00:49:46.109 --> 00:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
conditions post uh in the postpartum
 
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
period are
 
00:49:50.349 --> 00:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
um something that we have an opportunity
 
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
to improve upon um and I think uh
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
the what I've seen from other states in
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
Mississippi presented at our last uh
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
national meeting about um you know the
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
the importance of the health of the
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
mother in terms of the outcomes of the
 
00:50:14.789 --> 00:50:14.799 align:start position:0%
child and I think you know that is
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
something else that I'd like to be able
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
to you know produce some metrics on
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
eventually that you know healthy mother
 
00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:24.799 align:start position:0%
um those has a better experience in
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
terms of raising the child which you
 
00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
know when when that doesn't happen well
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of the things that we deal with in
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Service come into play
 
00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
right um and so um I think those are
 
00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:39.640 align:start position:0%
important things to look at given all
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
that uh what should representative
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
Edwards put in his LSR in terms of
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
frequency of report I I think if we did
 
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
something that you know at least
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
annually would be if you want to um
 
00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
phase into it we could do a a six-month
 
00:50:57.870 --> 00:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
and then after in a subsequent year go
 
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
to annual so that you you're getting
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
regular information I think when you're
 
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
looking at metrics it's a year's time is
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
typically more valuable but I think you
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
know just updating you on enrollment um
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
of postpartum and then you know an
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
annual report on sort of quality metrics
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
would be what I'd like to see uh
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
representative I I'd be happy to do that
 
00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
I I could use some text to we' be happy
 
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
to put together and and then if it's an
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
annual report we just need to be clear
 
00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:32.799 align:start position:0%
on when the best time timing of that
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
would be yeah so we run the Managed Care
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
Program same thing with the state fiscal
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
year so I think um something that would
 
00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
be like six months after the close of
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year would give us you know a
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
time to to have mature claims data and a
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
chance to put something together
 
00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:53.230 align:start position:0%
chance to put something together
representative

00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.910 align:start position:0%
 
Weber

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
ah see I always ignore her but I'm now
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
looking this way representative Merchant
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and Mr liin thank you
 
00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
for your comment about the quality side
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
um many times we have things that are on
 
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
the quantity um but we always don't hear
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
about the quality and what I'm more
 
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about from this committee is
 
00:52:17.789 --> 00:52:17.799 align:start position:0%
how it's impacting patient care um it's
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
nice to have the numbers but I think
 
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
your point on the I want to say I thank
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
you for bringing it to our attention is
 
00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
looking also at the Quality side are we
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
actually doing something with patient
 
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
care to improve it so thank you thank
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
you representative Weber thank you um
 
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
following up on representative Edward's
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
question I'm I'm really comfortable with
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
that in the dental capacity because it
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
seems to me that we've rolled out the
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
plan and you know the question is how is
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
it working going forward and are there
 
00:52:57.069 --> 00:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
changes that are going to be needed
 
00:52:59.470 --> 00:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
um just speaking for myself and I kind
 
00:53:01.789 --> 00:53:01.799 align:start position:0%
of wonder about other members of the
 
00:53:05.069 --> 00:53:05.079 align:start position:0%
committee uh the postpartum care is
 
00:53:06.789 --> 00:53:06.799 align:start position:0%
something that I think I might want to
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
hear about more often as it's still sort
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
of newer and again there's there's more
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
in-depth quality of life issues to look
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
at there in that I noticed that the
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
report we have unless there's another
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
one that I haven't found in the papers
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
here is all on the dental and the there
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
isn't anything on the postpartum side
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
unless I've missed it John John um
 
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
Williams sent an electronic version only
 
00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
one page I'll find it he didn't but I I
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
don't know how maybe I'm just being too
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
fussy so I'd love to hear from other
 
00:53:44.589 --> 00:53:44.599 align:start position:0%
committee members as to whether they saw
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
a differential between those two things
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
um I do and I appreciate that and I
 
00:53:53.069 --> 00:53:53.079 align:start position:0%
think since it took a lot of persuading
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
amongst some of my colleagues that going
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
out to a year
 
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
is Nob brainer we might want to keep the
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
data a little bit more frequent until
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
this becomes the normal in some people's
 
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
minds sure we can put together some
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
language for um representative Edwards
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
and to we can share with the committee
 
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
and so representative Merchant just more
 
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
of a comment than is a question I want
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
us to say thank you to Dr Pinn about
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
having the dental clinic mobile dental
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
clinic going to Claremont it was so nice
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
to see this hopefully it's on it's on
 
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
radar and it's going to happen has been
 
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
postponed but I want to say thank you
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh that was definitely a
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
a high priority um I do have um a number
 
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
of comments that I'm I'm ready to share
 
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
with you when you're finished with uh Mr
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
lman I think we're finished with the HB
 
00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:56.839 align:start position:0%
2 chapter 79 report and if one more all
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
right okay so I'm I'm happy to submit a
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill I'm not looking
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
to cause any consternation about a fight
 
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
over frequency I just raised the
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
question theoretically you know whether
 
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
the report timing is still accurate so I
 
00:55:17.069 --> 00:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
I I'm totally willing to defer to your
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
sense of need I I think I think we can
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
work together on that if the department
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
might be kind enough Mr Williams to
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
provide us with some language then you
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
co sponsor
 
00:55:33.069 --> 00:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
sure Mr Williams has been volunteered to
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
provide language thank
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
discussion and now Medicaid Program
 
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
adult Dental Medicaid expansion updates
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
Andy Lipman and Dr Sarah finny um thank
 
00:55:52.109 --> 00:55:52.119 align:start position:0%
you very much for your time this morning
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman and committee um I have
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of of good information to share
 
00:56:02.829 --> 00:56:02.839 align:start position:0%
with you if you turn to um go past the
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
cover page on the slide deck to the
 
00:56:08.029 --> 00:56:08.039 align:start position:0%
first slide which is service utilization
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
and program Administration I'm happy to
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
say that we are over 16,000 members
 
00:56:16.829 --> 00:56:16.839 align:start position:0%
served uh since the beginning of the
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
plan um in April of 23 and that
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
continues to grow every month uh if you
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
look at the chart of claims PID and
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
monthly members scene um you'll see that
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
there are some seasonal dips but um our
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
summertime dip this year was actually
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
less significant than in
 
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
2023 we are consistently running between
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
2700 3400 claims per month and 2200 to
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
2600 unique members a month being served
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
which are is very good for the age of
 
00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:54.750 align:start position:0%
which are is very good for the age of
this

00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
benefit um and then before I forget I
 
00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
want to link back to um the postpartum
 
00:57:03.309 --> 00:57:03.319 align:start position:0%
uh program that Mr Lipman was talking
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
about because we do have um a piece in
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
the the dental benefit pertaining
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
specifically to pregnant women and that
 
00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:15.400 align:start position:0%
is that um those individuals do get an
 
00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
additional cleaning uh that is part of
 
00:57:21.789 --> 00:57:21.799 align:start position:0%
the benefit during um their pregnancy
 
00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
and this is to start to address what we
 
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
know can be some um um side effects of
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
poor uh oral health on um both the um
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
time the the length of the pregnancy and
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
and early
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
delivery um so we are not only um
 
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
including that as part of the plan but
 
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
one of our quality measures is
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
specifically on what are the results how
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
is it working so you know obviously
 
00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
we're in the first year of this quality
 
00:57:57.789 --> 00:57:57.799 align:start position:0%
improvement project but we're looking at
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know how are the were the mothers
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
informed how are the providers informed
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
of this benefit and what support is
 
00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
given to make sure that the benefit is
 
00:58:11.069 --> 00:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
being used and um so I I will hopefully
 
00:58:13.029 --> 00:58:13.039 align:start position:0%
next year be able to share with you what
 
00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
the results of that are and um so you
 
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
know we're definitely trying to look at
 
00:58:22.589 --> 00:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
quality in this benefit um and I
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
realized this morning when I was going
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
over my slides I meant to include a link
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
to the adult Dental quality page on the
 
00:58:33.789 --> 00:58:33.799 align:start position:0%
state's um Quality uh website and so I
 
00:58:36.029 --> 00:58:36.039 align:start position:0%
will email that out to all of you with
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
the direct link to go directly to the
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
adult Dental benefit and you'll see that
 
00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.470 align:start position:0%
adult Dental benefit and you'll see that
we

00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
have probably at this point um somewhere
 
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
between 30 and 40 different measures and
 
00:58:51.549 --> 00:58:51.559 align:start position:0%
of course again because this is a young
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
program we're just now getting to the
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
point where we have a Year's worth of
 
00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
experience that we can start to look at
 
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
the data and and get some meaningful
 
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:03.799 align:start position:0%
information out of that but we're
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
definitely um you know sticking to the
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
plan that this should be value based and
 
00:59:11.789 --> 00:59:11.799 align:start position:0%
that it should be prevention oriented
 
00:59:14.029 --> 00:59:14.039 align:start position:0%
and so everything that we're doing is
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
keeping that in mind and trying to
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
encourage our members to not see this as
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
an emergency plan like what they had in
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
the past but this truly is a more
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
traditional plan where you get your
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
urgent needs met but then you also
 
00:59:34.349 --> 00:59:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
prevention representative Merchant thank
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um in regards to the
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
quality is there in the
 
00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:47.720 align:start position:0%
metrics a link between oral health and
 
00:59:49.069 --> 00:59:49.079 align:start position:0%
physical health in other words what I'm
 
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
trying to get to is that if people have
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
um dental care doesn't have a pronounced
 
00:59:59.789 --> 00:59:59.799 align:start position:0%
impact or any impact on the rest of the
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
physical care looking at if you will
 
01:00:03.549 --> 01:00:03.559 align:start position:0%
driving down medical costs because
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
they've been able to take care of the
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
dental right and that is is coming in
 
01:00:11.549 --> 01:00:11.559 align:start position:0%
the future uh but also what we have
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
provided right from the outset is Extra
 
01:00:16.589 --> 01:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
Care Management for individuals with
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
special Health Care needs so that they
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
are not you know falling to the side um
 
01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
so that's how we're starting and we are
 
01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
building the relationship between the
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
dental organization and the mcos um to
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
that end because we realize that we need
 
01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
together yes
 
01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.950 align:start position:0%
together yes
sorry

01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you Mr chairman
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
um can you tell us a little bit about
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
what how what the utilization Trends are
 
01:00:57.309 --> 01:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
is it cleanings mostly or is it
 
01:01:01.069 --> 01:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
restorative or what are people coming in
 
01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
for and also what are the weight List
 
01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
look like that's a very good question
 
01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question and I was
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
actually going to get to that when I
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit more about mobile
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
services but I'll certainly answer that
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
question now I think that um initially
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
it was more urgent needs that needed to
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
be met we've seen a lot of extractions
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
which which is what we expected but very
 
01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
interestingly in August Sal Healthcare
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
came to us and said that they wanted to
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
add hygiene services in addition to what
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
was currently offered during the mobile
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
visits so now we have basically doubled
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
the number of visits that are available
 
01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
for each mobile event by adding another
 
01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:52.119 align:start position:0%
hygienist there because what is
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
happening a a large number of the
 
01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:56.359 align:start position:0%
individuals who were treated did
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
restoratively in the U beginning months
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
of the program have now started to
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
transition to needing more preventive
 
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
services so this is what you would hope
 
01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.430 align:start position:0%
services so this is what you would hope
to

01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
see Sarah com the
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
weekend representative Merchant thank
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair one thing that I've um
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
shared with this committee before is
 
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
from the provider side and that's
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
looking at no shows and you know they're
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
kind enough to sign up for the program
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
usually it's not as advantageous
 
01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
financially as it would be a uh a
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
commercial payer if you will so are we
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
tracking or trying to get some feedback
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
my concern is with the providers that if
 
01:02:40.029 --> 01:02:40.039 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of no-shows that show up
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
clientele that they may decide to back
 
01:02:45.789 --> 01:02:45.799 align:start position:0%
out of the program so are we tracking
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
that any way to Ure that we're not
 
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
getting sort of a yeah um and that's
 
01:02:52.829 --> 01:02:52.839 align:start position:0%
also a very good question so thank you
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
for asking that um I have not
 
01:02:59.710 --> 01:02:59.720 align:start position:0%
gotten an unusual amount of commentary
 
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
about missed appointments what we are
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
doing within the program is uh there are
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
two codes their procedure codes that are
 
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
used to track either missed appointments
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
or late cancellations and we are
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
tracking those and part of the reason
 
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
besides you know wanting to have that
 
01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:20.599 align:start position:0%
data is that that information is shared
 
01:03:22.269 --> 01:03:22.279 align:start position:0%
with the care coordinators who are
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
reaching out to the specific individuals
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
who have missed appointments and trying
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
to speak with them to find out what was
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
it was it child care was it
 
01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
Transportation were you sick and to try
 
01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
to give the support to these individuals
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
to make sure that when they do make
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
future appointments that they're there
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
and if they really can't make the
 
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
appointment that they you know do the
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
Outreach that they need to to change it
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
so um I I would have to say I think
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
we're I think it's working because I
 
01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
have not gotten that as a
 
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
a as strong a comment from providers as
 
01:04:02.269 --> 01:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
past I didn't see this anywhere in the
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
handout maybe you're going to get to it
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
in your presentation but I'm interested
 
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
in changes total number of unique
 
01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
providers unique locations unique oral
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
surgeons unique oral surgeons location
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
have we pretty well plateaued in those
 
01:04:22.589 --> 01:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
things because you've got everybody
 
01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
signed up to do the procedures who sign
 
01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
up aable or
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
or all right I if you're finished with
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
questions on utilization I see
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards has
 
01:04:36.589 --> 01:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards is my next slide
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
okay so Mr Litman if if this isn't a
 
01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
50-50 match correct me I I think this is
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
a 50/50 match so individuals who on
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
granted advantage to be a 9010 match so
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
there is definitely 9010 money in here
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't have it with me but I can CH
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
that's all right um but it's at least 50
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
yes okay and and and the general funds
 
01:05:02.029 --> 01:05:02.039 align:start position:0%
portion is currently being paid for out
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
of the centine fund are we tracking I'm
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
sure you are but let me say that
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
differently I'd be curious to know the
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
burn rate of the centine money and the
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
implications that burn rate has on uh
 
01:05:21.269 --> 01:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
next year's budget we have actually our
 
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
last slide deals with that very question
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
um but I'll take it while you have asked
 
01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
it is that um we have uh forecasted that
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you we have forecasted that the um
 
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
the settlement money based on the level
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
of utilization is going to last us
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
through the next bium um and so we're
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
not expecting to ask have to ask for an
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation and the budget for for
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
dental for the adult dental program
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
which is longer you know when we sort of
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
built the initial budget we didn't have
 
01:05:56.109 --> 01:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
a sense of what the sign up and the use
 
01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
rates were going to be we use sort of
 
01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
national expectations and um and in the
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
last SL we'll also talk a little about
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
we protected ourselves from the state
 
01:06:08.269 --> 01:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
standpoint with a minimum medical loss
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
ratio um and so we're getting money back
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
that that was above or excuse me below
 
01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
what the expected spending was and
 
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
that's what's allowing us to to go all
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
the way out to 27 okay thank you Mr
 
01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
lman okay so now we can move on to the
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
next slide which is our Network
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
dashboard so um to answer your question
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson we have plateaued
 
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
to a certain extent
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
however um as I noted on this slide
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
there have been over 350 in-person
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
office Outreach visits um by a uh
 
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
provider relations representative from
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
DentaQuest that includes office that are
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
not currently enrolled as well as
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
circling back with current providers to
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
see if um if situations have changed
 
01:07:08.269 --> 01:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
that they're able to see more um members
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
than they were initially and to try to
 
01:07:14.109 --> 01:07:14.119 align:start position:0%
provide support to them if they have
 
01:07:16.589 --> 01:07:16.599 align:start position:0%
issues that may have gone
 
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
unmet um so we are actively working on
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
that and I can tell you that since I
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
received this dashboard dashboard on the
 
01:07:29.269 --> 01:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
11 of October I know that there are at
 
01:07:31.269 --> 01:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
least three more providers coming
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
through the pipeline that will be
 
01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
enrolled within the next few weeks um we
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
have not given up on on recruitment uh
 
01:07:44.109 --> 01:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
and I think that retention is just as
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
important which is why this
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
representative is still going around and
 
01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
meeting with the offices that are in
 
01:07:53.309 --> 01:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
network um to have a touch base with
 
01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
them um you know we are still meeting on
 
01:07:59.470 --> 01:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
a weekly basis just as we did when we
 
01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
were going through implementation we
 
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
have a standing agenda where items do
 
01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
not come off of there until those issues
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
have been completely addressed finalized
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
we bring new things on every week um I
 
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
can tell you that you know DHHS
 
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
Northeast Delta and DentaQuest and
 
01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
salair for that matter are at the desk
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
every week looking at what's working
 
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
what do we need to work on what can we
 
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
improve because we know we can't rest
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
we're not where we need to be entirely
 
01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
yet so um I think one of the things that
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
we have been trying to um let providers
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
know is that some of the classic things
 
01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:46.759 align:start position:0%
that were less tolerable about being a
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid provider that we have addressed
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
are coming true um we've tried to refine
 
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
credentialing as much as we possibly can
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know the the unfortunate piece is
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
that because this is a Medicaid Program
 
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
they not only have to enroll with a
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
dental organization but they have to
 
01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
enroll with the state as well so you
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
can't get around those two credentialing
 
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
um times but claims are processing very
 
01:09:14.669 --> 01:09:14.679 align:start position:0%
quickly if a clean C clean claim comes
 
01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
in it pays within a week
 
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.669 align:start position:0%
in it pays within a week
generally

01:09:18.669 --> 01:09:18.679 align:start position:0%
generally
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
sorry okay
 
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
um uh um you know claims uh processing
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
is going well we have minimal procedures
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
that have to have prior authorization
 
01:09:35.789 --> 01:09:35.799 align:start position:0%
because that was another sticking point
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
we have looked at the fee schedule and
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
changes have been targeted to certain
 
01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
procedures that we realized there was an
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
issue with um our reimbursement being a
 
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
little too slim and so I I think that if
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
we can all talk more about the positive
 
01:09:55.709 --> 01:09:55.719 align:start position:0%
parts of this program and we're we've
 
01:09:58.030 --> 01:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
really tried to listen to the providers
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
and the members for that matter um we
 
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
have tried to address those things uh to
 
01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
make the program better than your
 
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:12.669 --> 01:10:12.679 align:start position:0%
Program representative Murphy thank you
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um thank you for the report
 
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
I'm my question would be you know it may
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
be obvious that finances it's follow the
 
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
money you know type of thing but what is
 
01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
it in your experience now that uh
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
incentivizes or disincentivizes a
 
01:10:30.189 --> 01:10:30.199 align:start position:0%
provider should take on some of these
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
patients so is it is it no shows is it
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know the type of patient is it the
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursement what is it that now
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
actually one of and this is a very good
 
01:10:42.189 --> 01:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
question one of the major issues is the
 
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
workforce challenges that we have in
 
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
dentistry just like every other health
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
care profession and many of the
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
providers who have a limited um opening
 
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
for for our members to be seen it's
 
01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
because they don't have enough staff to
 
01:10:59.310 --> 01:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
increase the number of members they can
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
see so just follow up follow thank you
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
um what
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
percentage what what's the average
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of a
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
provider uh that has these patients on
 
01:11:17.229 --> 01:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
their um uh profile do you have an idea
 
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
of what percentage of a routin provider
 
01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
takes so for instance in New York City
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
you know the the goal is not to have
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
insurance you know if you don't have
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
insurance you are a star so my question
 
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
would be what percentage of the you know
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
the routine dental office has these Prof
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
panel commercial insurance or just
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid probably uh and
 
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
I am going off of numbers from the
 
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
health policy Institute of vaada of how
 
01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
many many dentists we have in the state
 
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I would say roughly
 
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
25% okay so I think your question may be
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
what's the payer mix of it so oh the P
 
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
um it's sry if you don't have it's
 
01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
that's really tough for me to answer
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
because because this is managed care I
 
01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
don't hold all of the
 
01:12:28.669 --> 01:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
um claims data and the information about
 
01:12:28.679 --> 01:12:29.590 align:start position:0%
um claims data and the information about
the

01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
offices and the volume that they're
 
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
seeing in our program um but I will take
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
that question back and see if I can get
 
01:12:42.189 --> 01:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate okay if I if I could maybe
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
provide a little bit more context here
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
you know um the New Hampshire Medicaid
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
Program is the fourth smallest in the
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
country um you know we have um one in
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
seven citizens are in the program you
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
know our neighboring states like Maine
 
01:12:59.790 --> 01:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
and Vermont are typically one in three
 
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
one in four maybe one in five at points
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
in time so in terms of what you would
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
expect of an overall um pair mix that um
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
you know I think the insurance
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
department was just reporting today in
 
01:13:13.709 --> 01:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
the commercial Market Medicaid
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
represents about 9% of of the the
 
01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:19.470 align:start position:0%
represents about 9% of of the the
business

01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
and yes followup so that generated
 
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
another follow-up question for me I
 
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
guess then um
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
if we rank in the fourth or fifth you
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
know percentile or number of where we
 
01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
are as far as the Medicaid Program goes
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
in this country um what what is our
 
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
rate so so on on the dental side we did
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
a study with um our actuary on that and
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
if I'm remembering the number right it's
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
like 72 or 73% of commercial which is
 
01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:51.400 align:start position:0%
part of the appropriation that was made
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
was I think to address that um component
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
and also so the the last uh legislative
 
01:13:59.790 --> 01:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
session allowed us to have the rates for
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
children and adult to be the same so
 
01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
there's not a disincentive to see adults
 
01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
and or children and so I think um as
 
01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
compared to other Medicaid programs I
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
think we're probably you know in the top
 
01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
courti now in terms of what Medicaid
 
01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
you okay um then we can move on to the
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
upcoming schedule for the mobile clinic
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
is the next slide um as you can see
 
01:14:33.149 --> 01:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
these are booked out a month and a half
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
to two months in advance um going over
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
the weekends they have added some
 
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
Fridays uh you know and again that has
 
01:14:43.149 --> 01:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
to do with
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
Staffing um the mobile clinics are are
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
having I think very good uh results in
 
01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
terms of no shows uh they are uh you
 
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
know confirming appointments and in a
 
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
multiple you know number of ways and
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
they also have weight lists so that if
 
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
someone does cancel they have the
 
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to try to get someone else
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
in to fill that slot and I think that
 
01:15:11.629 --> 01:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
their their methods have gotten better
 
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
as time has gone on um and as I said
 
01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
earlier they have recently uh Midway
 
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
through September added an additional
 
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
hygienist each weekend and that has
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
virtually doubled the number of
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
appointment slots that are available um
 
01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
at each event and so I think that as we
 
01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
look at our claims and and member
 
01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
treatment numbers moving forward that's
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
going to start to show that you're we're
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
going to see another um rise in both of
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
those things if somebody wishes to book
 
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
an appointment how does he or she do
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
that uh there is a specific phone number
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
um and I'm glad that you asked that
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
question because we have really tried to
 
01:15:55.629 --> 01:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
um notify our members in a number of
 
01:15:57.629 --> 01:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
ways how they can make
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
appointments um there is a flyer that is
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
posted on the New Hampshire Medicaid
 
01:16:06.189 --> 01:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
adult Dental web page um there is also
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
information on the member portion of the
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
dest portal where they can go online to
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
den aest and see what the the schedule
 
01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
is we also push out notifications in the
 
01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
department social media feeds so if you
 
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
watch over you know I think On th either
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
Wednesday or Thursday day there was a
 
01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
posting out there for um the visit to
 
01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
lonia this week and it includes a link
 
01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
um to those that flyer but also has the
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
phone number for that I have some
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid people in the medical practice
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
I oversee and I do not I'm not in the
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
clinical side so I would not know
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
whether some of these people would wish
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
to book an appointment could you tell me
 
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
the telephone number please I don't know
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
it offand but you know what I will do
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
when I get back to my laptop I will send
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
the flyer to each of you so that if you
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
have constituents who need that
 
01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
information you have the whole flyer
 
01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also
 
01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the information about the
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
mobile clinic um obviously social media
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
is well utilized one of the things I
 
01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
would like to do is again the same thing
 
01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
if we boost that into uh we had
 
01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
something called what's up Claremont
 
01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
which is well it's over 14,000 people
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
follow it I don't want to be doing
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
something that's going to cause more
 
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
heartburn so if I take the information
 
01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
and post it on the social media or post
 
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
it onto the um the city's um newsletter
 
01:17:40.629 --> 01:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
if you will I don't want to trip over
 
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
something all of a sudden have something
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
causing a problem that would not cause a
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
problem okay I mean we're really
 
01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
reaching out to our stakeholders like
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire um oral health
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
Coalition very graciously posts a lot of
 
01:17:55.149 --> 01:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
this information just for that reason we
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
want to get the information out there in
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
a number of places because hopefully you
 
01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
know every member will at least find one
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:12.760 align:start position:0%

01:18:29.629 --> 01:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
um as you can see we continue to meet
 
01:18:32.189 --> 01:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
with um a number of different
 
01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
organizations and groups because we want
 
01:18:37.709 --> 01:18:37.719 align:start position:0%

want that
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
information um and then in addition to
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
that there is both a provider advisory
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%

01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
that dent Quest has these meet quarterly

and with the intention that they have
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
direct conversations with the two groups
 
01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
that are most important to the benefit
 
01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
the providers and the members so that
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
they can really hear what's going on get
 
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
feedback directly from those individuals
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
and then work on um the information that
 
01:19:48.719 --> 01:19:49.870 align:start position:0%
and then work on um the information that
they

01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
receive do you want me to
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
mention that's all right I have two
 
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
um very happy uh updates to make number
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
one is um we recently found out that the
 
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
center for digital government uh in
 
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
their 2024 digital States survey gave
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire an A minus grade for
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
exemplary work in Health and Human
 
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
Services um Information Technology
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
systems specifically calling out the
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
work that we did with the adult Dental
 
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
benefit implementation and um the fact
 
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
that we really went from July uh 20122
 
01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
to April 1st 23 and stood up a benefit
 
01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
in that amount of time which really
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of very hard work so I'm
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
very proud to be part of that team I
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
want to say thank you um to all of you
 
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:50.320 align:start position:0%

I have to thank everyone at the
 
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
department and Northeast Delta and
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
enquest that worked on this um so that
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
we could bring the plan forward and then
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
the second um very hot off the press
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
information is that um our own as in
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
conquered z um Dr Richard Rado who is an
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
oral surgeon here in conquer was just
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%

01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
president next October he'll spend this
 
01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
year following the current president and
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
learning the ropes um rich is a a
 
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
wonderful human being has devoted
 
01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
himself um above and beyond um to oral
 
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
health and dentistry and I'm thrilled I
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
was able to be there um when he was
 
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
elected and to celebrate with him uh but
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
we should all be very proud that one of
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
our own is going to represent us on the
 
01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:51.350 align:start position:0%
our own is going to represent us on the
national

01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
level I asked this question a while ago
 
01:21:54.239 --> 01:21:55.669 align:start position:0%
level I asked this question a while ago
and

01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
I just wonder if there's anything new to
 
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
share any work on Contracting with
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
dentists to be or very newly minted
 
01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
dentists uh loan forgiveness in exchange
 
01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
for yes we continue to work there's the
 
01:22:19.149 --> 01:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
state loan repayment program which um in
 
01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
the past did not allow Private Practice
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
dentists to tap into those funds there's
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
a separate program for them so it's not
 
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
just dentists who are affiliated with
 
01:22:31.870 --> 01:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Centers and
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
community health centers so those are
 
01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
two state run programs um Northeast
 
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
Delta Dental has a program their own
 
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
student loan repayment program now for
 
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
Maine Vermont and New Hampshire they
 
01:22:48.669 --> 01:22:48.679 align:start position:0%
have already paid out probably close to
 
01:22:48.679 --> 01:22:49.669 align:start position:0%
have already paid out probably close to
$2

01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
$2
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
million um in the two years that that
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
has been operating um I also the
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
department has a recruitment contract
 
01:23:01.629 --> 01:23:01.639 align:start position:0%
with by state Primary Care Association
 
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
they go to dental schools to Career
 
01:23:08.189 --> 01:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
Fairs uh there's a whole recruitment
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
piece there going on um so we are we are
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
definitely looking at all the ways that
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
we can you know bring these dentists in
 
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
and all of those loan repayment programs
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
have a Medicaid piece to them that you
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
do have to see a certain um percentage
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
of of your
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
um patient mix is from from Medicaid and
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
the the amount varies from program to
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
program representative Murphy thank you
 
01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and for the record the new
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
president of the Ada his last name is
 
01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
you all right representative Edwards
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I saw the award the
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
a minus and I've heard a little bit
 
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
about it I I just want to make sure I
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
understand the uh how the dental program
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
tied into that digital Excellence award
 
01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
I am I right to
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
assume that it wasn't the clinical
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
aspect or or or of the program it was
 
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
the implementation of the eligibility
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
through the it systems and and if that's
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
the case was that an mmis
 
01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
uh adaptation I mean it's a great
 
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
program you know I love this program but
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to understand what the
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
award was was
 
01:24:38.109 --> 01:24:38.119 align:start position:0%
for it it was um New Hampshire
 
01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
doit deserves a lot of credit here in
 
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:43.400 align:start position:0%
terms but the way if you kind of think
 
01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
of it this way that the the the
 
01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure side is New Hampshire
 
01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
doit so when we're making system changes
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
to accommodate the the benefit we rely
 
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire doit to do work plus
 
01:25:01.149 --> 01:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
the vendor um that uh supplies conduit
 
01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
who supplies the the technology but
 
01:25:05.390 --> 01:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work that had to be
 
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
done in mmis which is where I think that
 
01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
the the the recognition is coming from
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
and and the work that they did you know
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
it was um U we we were told by CMS was
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
the second fastest ever benefit that
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
they ever saw stood up and dental and it
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
required I think New Hampshire doit to
 
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
adjust priorities and and to to work to
 
01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
recognize how important it was you know
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
I spent um we spent time at the
 
01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
beginning um just trying to share what
 
01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
the consequences of not meeting
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
deadlines were and um you know the um
 
01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner's team from doit were you
 
01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't have asked for a better partner
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
in doing that and I think that uh the
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
commitment they had to making something
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
stood up it wouldn't work without them
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
so very thankful for their
 
01:25:59.950 --> 01:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
partnership that that's outstanding I
 
01:26:01.629 --> 01:26:01.639 align:start position:0%
mean the state spends a lot of money on
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
mmis and on other infrastructure so it's
 
01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
nice to see sort of U an objective uh
 
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
quality achievement so everyone involved
 
01:26:17.070 --> 01:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
thank you there's also uh work that went
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
on on the elig I mean the the system
 
01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
that where we do the El hold the
 
01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
eligibility the new height system
 
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes um they they deserve credit as
 
01:26:29.149 --> 01:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
well in terms of um the work that they
 
01:26:31.149 --> 01:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
did to support standing it up because
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
they were a key part of the the um cost
 
01:26:37.149 --> 01:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
sharing uh the co-pays so there were a
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
lot there was a lot of technical work
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
this follow up so do I assume at some
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
point because so many moving parts were
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
in there there was like a a single
 
01:26:53.790 --> 01:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
person or maybe two people that were the
 
01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
project managers that coordinated and
 
01:26:59.229 --> 01:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
drove all of this if if if there's an
 
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
actual human that was the project
 
01:27:04.510 --> 01:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
manager of all this I would I I mean
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't just sort of a blob
 
01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
that moved it had to be somebody who
 
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
made it happen right I I'd like to know
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know who the that individual
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
is because i' I'd like to do something
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
to recognize the individual who maybe
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
spearheaded and coordinated this overall
 
01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:24.390 align:start position:0%
spearheaded and coordinated this overall
project

01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
think I you're here his name AI so we
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
can it's probably fair to say there's
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
project manager on on the technical side
 
01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire doit we can share
 
01:27:39.229 --> 01:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
share that and then from the Department
 
01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
side Sarah was obviously um instrumental
 
01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
but Olivia May who was on the Medicaid
 
01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:49.400 align:start position:0%
team um and Ken gagy who was on the doit
 
01:27:52.109 --> 01:27:52.119 align:start position:0%
team would probably be the two like
 
01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
quarterbacks of making sure that this
 
01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
happen on time right um You said gag and
 
01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
La yeah gagy and Lacy um Olivia o i v i
 
01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:10.280 align:start position:0%
a right May m a y and um Ken gagy g a g
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
NE um from New Hampshire dyt I'm sure
 
01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:17.719 align:start position:0%
there are other people but who the one
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
um Mike U Mike Williams is the other
 
01:28:24.109 --> 01:28:24.119 align:start position:0%
person from New Hampshire dyt who is was
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
was Ken's boss I think at the time right
 
01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:28.109 align:start position:0%
was Ken's boss I think at the time right
yeah

01:28:28.109 --> 01:28:28.119 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:28:28.119 --> 01:28:30.229 align:start position:0%
yeah
right

01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
Mr all right and representative Murphy I
 
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
would I would just say that before
 
01:28:38.669 --> 01:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards gets ahead of
 
01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
himself a bit if we give him time to uh
 
01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:43.639 align:start position:0%
think of others that may have been
 
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
involved um if you could email
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards with those names
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
as well so I appreciate it thank
 
01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
you anyone else from the committee
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant it's more of a
 
01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
comment than a question I just want to
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
say thank you for all the work you put
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
into this program it's made a tremendous
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
difference and I wanted to recognize
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you very much and I
 
01:29:09.109 --> 01:29:09.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate all of your support yeah and
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
you just in closing uh the last slide is
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
just shows the amount of money that we
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
expect to recover from the first 14mon
 
01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
period um you we used about I'm thinking
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
about 40% of the expected full premium
 
01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
in the first year um and um
 
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm I think also too a key element
 
01:29:39.310 --> 01:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
not all states have it was a minimum
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
spending on medical if they didn't meet
 
01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
that amount that gets rebated and so
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
we're forecasting about 6.4 million of
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's coming back to us and if you use
 
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
that number um compared to the 24.8
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
about 25% of this is um coming from the
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
state share if you will um so the way
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
these recruitments happen is the feds
 
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
get back their portion that they put in
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
and the state gets back its portion that
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
we put in and so you can see out of
 
01:30:09.790 --> 01:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
24.8 um we're expecting
 
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
6.44 um and uh 18.4 will go back to the
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
in thank you thank you wonderful thank
 
01:30:23.070 --> 01:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
you for all the time and the question
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
and now the 10e mental health plan
 
01:30:39.790 --> 01:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:52.280 align:start position:0%

morning two of our Bureau Chiefs um and
 
01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:10.760 align:start position:0%

01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
them on the spot to present the plan
 
01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
this morning um however it's important
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
for you to be able to match a name and a

Tenny who is the chief of the bureau of
 
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:28.520 align:start position:0%

joined us just earlier this
year

01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
great could we have that last name oh
 
01:31:50.910 --> 01:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and so we're really pleased to be
 
01:31:57.629 --> 01:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
here this morning to present our um key
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
accomplishments and our 10-year plan uh
 
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
report for this year um this is marking
 
01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:09.400 align:start position:0%
about the halfway mark for our 10e plan
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
and this is not one of those plans that
 
01:32:14.189 --> 01:32:14.199 align:start position:0%
sat has sat on a shelf this is something
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
that has really driven the policy the
 
01:32:20.910 --> 01:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
programs and the funding requests um
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
over the last 5 years and as we had in
 
01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:28.119 align:start position:0%
into the next vium so we started um
 
01:32:30.430 --> 01:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
getting together saying okay we got to
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
pull all the information together what
 
01:32:35.229 --> 01:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
do we have what have we done over the
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
last year and we're like oh there's not
 
01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
going to be much to report out and then
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
we started talking about it and then we
 
01:32:43.629 --> 01:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
started doing our inventory of looking
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
at what has been done um over the last
 
01:32:51.070 --> 01:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
year um as as we mark this
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
anniversary and so there is a lot that
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
has happened um so contrary to my first
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
line of thinking um you'll see that
 
01:33:05.550 --> 01:33:05.560 align:start position:0%
there has been continued work um and
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
progress in this Arena and so when I say
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
we you know we've accomplished a lot I
 
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
don't want you to think that I'm
 
01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
conveying that's the department has done
 
01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
this this has been done through a
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort through the
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
governor the
 
01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
legislature the all handson um approach
 
01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
from our stakeholders our Advocates our
 
01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
uh providers and also most importantly
 
01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
continue to be informed by the people
 
01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
that were serving and people with mental
 
01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:37.550 align:start position:0%
that were serving and people with mental
health

01:33:37.550 --> 01:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
conditions and this also reflects some
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
of the highlights that we'll be going
 
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
through um is really looking at um how
 
01:33:49.629 --> 01:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
we continue to transform our mental
 
01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
health system to meet today's needs but
 
01:33:54.669 --> 01:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
also that we're not not just
 
01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
transforming and constantly in a state
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
of chaos and change but that we really
 
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
need to take time to look at how we're
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
maturing those programs so what are we
 
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
doing to build them out and stabilize
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
our system um before jumping to the next
 
01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
new thing so we always are taking that
 
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
and balancing those two pieces so that
 
01:34:22.109 --> 01:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
we're not um again always um changing to
 
01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
the latest and the newest um but really
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the 10year plan as our um
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
goto and revisiting that um not that
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
we're not taking advantage of innovation
 
01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
and new things that come down the line
 
01:34:39.390 --> 01:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
but making sure that they're aligned and
 
01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
that we're um we're really investing in
 
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
what we already
 
01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
have um and we've been making use of
 
01:34:49.229 --> 01:34:49.239 align:start position:0%
one-time funds for infrastructure and I
 
01:34:51.870 --> 01:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
know that um is really important to the
 
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
legislature as especially as you're
 
01:34:57.990 --> 01:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
looking to this next upcoming um bium um
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that we could we
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
invested in uh bricks and mortar um and
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
then um we also are looking at how are
 
01:35:12.510 --> 01:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
we maturing those programs um through
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
such things as mobile crisis in 988 you
 
01:35:18.750 --> 01:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
probably or you may be aware that some
 
01:35:20.830 --> 01:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
of the um federal funds that have come
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
in if you sit on fiscal or pay attention
 
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council that we again
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
are using those funds to build out um
 
01:35:33.550 --> 01:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
those uh systems so what we want to do
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
I'll Orient you to what's before you you
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
have the introductory letter from the
 
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner you have the key
 
01:35:44.109 --> 01:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
accomplishments around the 12 areas and
 
01:35:46.270 --> 01:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
then we have some supplemental
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
information so there's information in
 
01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
your packet about Mission zero which I
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
hope that you have heard about there's
 
01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
is some
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
data and there is the last piece which
 
01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
we included uh last year but this is a
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
little bit more built out around the
 
01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
strongest Granite
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
campaign so um what we're going to do
 
01:36:12.189 --> 01:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
I'll pause there to see if there are any
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
Edwards thank you I it's labeled but I
 
01:36:18.990 --> 01:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that this label
 
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
is is is accurate this it says
 
01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
accomplishments in 2024
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
so Pages 3 through six are an itemized
 
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
bullet list of the things that you guys
 
01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
have done in the last 12 months yes okay
 
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
this is just outstanding I I um I'm I'm
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
really impressed I I I'd like to I'd
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
like to ask you about something that I
 
01:36:45.629 --> 01:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
don't see as accomplished in goal one
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
and and just ask you about it and and
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
that is um when we when we passed um I
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
think I think it was uh HB 49 a couple
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
years ago related to the new Youth
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
Development Center uh one of the things
 
01:37:04.629 --> 01:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
about the youth development center uh
 
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
was that we recognized that we were
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
moving to a trauma informed therapeutic
 
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
model and that for the length of time
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
that you would expect a kid to be in the
 
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
facility it would be inadequate to deal
 
01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
with their entire uh setup and treatment
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
and ongoing care so one of the key
 
01:37:29.709 --> 01:37:29.719 align:start position:0%
things that were considered conceptually
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
was that we wanted to actively use the
 
01:37:34.830 --> 01:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
Youth Development Center as an
 
01:37:37.470 --> 01:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity a point of care in the
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
Continuum to where we would connect out
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
to the system of care in an active way
 
01:37:46.030 --> 01:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
using virtual Technologies or or
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
whatever and so so I'm just curious if
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
if that's something you've made some
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
progress on or uh and just didn't list
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
or if or or what you think about the
 
01:37:59.950 --> 01:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
status of that and whether it's an
 
01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
active part of your plan so great Point
 
01:38:06.189 --> 01:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative Edwards thank you for
 
01:38:08.669 --> 01:38:08.679 align:start position:0%
raising that we did give a nod to it but
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
in a very more vague way than what you
 
01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
just um described so we could have been
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
U more clear about that but under the um
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
intervention intervening earlier so
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
under goal number three uh the last
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
bullet does um again give reference to
 
01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
that under Juvenile Justice
 
01:38:32.470 --> 01:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
transformation work and really looking
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
at that um aspect of it so good point um
 
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
it may be a revision that's forthcoming
 
01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
but that is a a part of our ongoing work
 
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
through the um work with DCF and
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
children's system of
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
care followup I I just want to restate
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
you know the importance of that
 
01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:54.229 align:start position:0%
you know the importance of that
connectivity

01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
connectivity
 
01:38:57.070 --> 01:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
um we're spending a whole lot of money
 
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
in a new Youth Development Center and
 
01:39:02.430 --> 01:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
we're doing it on the belief that we
 
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that these
 
01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
shot absolutely and we that connect I'm
 
01:39:25.149 --> 01:39:25.159 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm just trying to gather myself
 
01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
it's a personal issue but um just want
 
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that those kids are
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
connected to the community so that they
 
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
have the best chance sorry that's my
 
01:39:39.629 --> 01:39:39.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
impression so thank you and um I feel it
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
too I feel it
 
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
too I do want to raise um because um of
 
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
this critical piece and I just spoke
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
about this at the governor's commission
 
01:39:59.629 --> 01:39:59.639 align:start position:0%
about transitions in care and that has
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
been a significant amount of work that
 
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
we have focused on in all aspects of the
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
work that we are doing uh in the
 
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
department so transitions from
 
01:40:13.709 --> 01:40:13.719 align:start position:0%
residential treatment to community
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
transitions from a um incarcerated
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
setting to um lower levels of care and
 
01:40:24.990 --> 01:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
specifically to what you're speaking of
 
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
is that we are now working and um in a
 
01:40:33.550 --> 01:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
very expedited fashion to work um on a
 
01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
new opportunity through CMS um which
 
01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
requires the department to look at how
 
01:40:44.669 --> 01:40:44.679 align:start position:0%
we are engaging Our Youth and um
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
preparing them for uh transition to the
 
01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
community so adjudicated youth at YDC um
 
01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
um will we're going to be able to have a
 
01:40:59.629 --> 01:40:59.639 align:start position:0%
a limited Medicaid benefit that provides
 
01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
targeted case management for those
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
Services um before they transition into
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
the community so the whole emphasis is
 
01:41:12.589 --> 01:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
don't wait until they transition which
 
01:41:14.310 --> 01:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
we aren't but we're going to be able to
 
01:41:18.109 --> 01:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
take advantage of that Medicaid um
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
participation um the federal financial
 
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
support to be able to have those
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
Services um start 30 days prior to um
 
01:41:31.709 --> 01:41:31.719 align:start position:0%
their um release to the community and
 
01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
also have it continue on for um another
 
01:41:38.910 --> 01:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
30 days and so um I'm sure director
 
01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
Litman would be happy to talk a little
 
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
bit more about that but again it speaks
 
01:41:47.870 --> 01:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
really to what are we doing because we
 
01:41:51.470 --> 01:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
know how critical um those um services
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
are going to be for to make that
 
01:41:56.669 --> 01:41:56.679 align:start position:0%
transition reduce recidivism improve
 
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
Community ties improve Family Ties so um
 
01:42:03.149 --> 01:42:03.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for for raising that
 
01:42:03.159 --> 01:42:05.149 align:start position:0%
thank you for for raising that
representative

01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
Weber and I guess I would put in the
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
same plea on behalf of Youth who are
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
under the care of DCF and coming of age
 
01:42:16.669 --> 01:42:16.679 align:start position:0%
and who have many of whom not all of
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
whom but many of whom have ongoing
 
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
needs um and less capacity to manage
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
those needs than some people do so um I
 
01:42:31.229 --> 01:42:31.239 align:start position:0%
I I just put in a plug for that side of
 
01:42:33.149 --> 01:42:33.159 align:start position:0%
things does this grant cover them as
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
well actually it does it um is not only
 
01:42:40.750 --> 01:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
for those um who are 18 and under but it
 
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
also is for former foster children so
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
there are um this benefit will also be
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
part um of the adult uh correctional
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
system in the
 
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
State Prison and in counties and looking
 
01:42:58.750 --> 01:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
at providing that benefit for them as
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
well up to age
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
26 repres Senator Rosenwald thank you Mr
 
01:43:07.629 --> 01:43:07.639 align:start position:0%
chairman I have a couple of questions if
 
01:43:10.270 --> 01:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
I could but first I'd like to
 
01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
congratulate the department for having
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
Dart meth Hitchcock take over the
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
management the clinical management of
 
01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
Hamstead it's not on here but maybe
 
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
that's cuz it technically started with
 
01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
2025 but um congratulations on that I
 
01:43:33.149 --> 01:43:33.159 align:start position:0%
think that's going to make a big
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
difference to the population of
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
hospitalized children um I I sat down
 
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
this morning with my first cup of coffee
 
01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
and ReRe the state's tenure Mental
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
Health Plan and the first
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation was to increase Medicare
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
provider rates you have it in goal
 
01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:57.750 align:start position:0%
provider rates you have it in goal
number

01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
eight um so my question
 
01:44:07.229 --> 01:44:07.239 align:start position:0%
is we in the budget allocated something
 
01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
like 304 million dollar of total funds
 
01:44:16.109 --> 01:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
over the two years for Medicaid rates an
 
01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
average of
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
11% across all service lines what was
 
01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
the actual Medicaid rate increase to the
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health
 
01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
Centers so
 
01:44:38.430 --> 01:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
um I would invite um our director Litman
 
01:44:41.669 --> 01:44:41.679 align:start position:0%
to join us if you want to um specifics
 
01:44:44.830 --> 01:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:55.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
the question was for the Community
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers specifically what
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
was their actual Medicaid rating I have
 
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
that information I don't have it off the
 
01:45:06.910 --> 01:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
top of my head um but we do have we've
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
calculated that um and um you know in
 
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
addition to the the rate increase
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
themselves um for the Community Mental
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
Health Centers um you know we our
 
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
general goal was to Target to be um 100%
 
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
of Medicare for the Community Mental
 
01:45:26.430 --> 01:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
Health centers on our rates um and the
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
difference of that is kind of what we
 
01:45:30.669 --> 01:45:30.679 align:start position:0%
sort of measured would be that um and
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
then I think the other thing is the the
 
01:45:34.589 --> 01:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
way that we restructured the Managed
 
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
Care contract um there is no longer a
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort provision in the
 
01:45:42.629 --> 01:45:42.639 align:start position:0%
between the mcos and the Community
 
01:45:46.669 --> 01:45:46.679 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers and um we are now
 
01:45:48.669 --> 01:45:48.679 align:start position:0%
requiring that the rates that are paid
 
01:45:51.149 --> 01:45:51.159 align:start position:0%
to be a directed payment of the the
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
capitation rate that the actuary
 
01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
calculate so there's no leakage of of
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
dollars there so we think that in
 
01:45:58.669 --> 01:45:58.679 align:start position:0%
addition to what you appropriate as a
 
01:46:01.149 --> 01:46:01.159 align:start position:0%
legislature that between three and 5
 
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
million more based on how we've
 
01:46:04.709 --> 01:46:04.719 align:start position:0%
restructured the Managed Care contract
 
01:46:07.709 --> 01:46:07.719 align:start position:0%
will make its way to the um Community
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers but I will get you
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
the exact numbers thank you could could
 
01:46:16.030 --> 01:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
I follow up please so we've heard from
 
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
the community mental health centers that
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to discharge
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
patients who lose insurance coverage
 
01:46:32.189 --> 01:46:32.199 align:start position:0%
unlike other doctors who can discharge
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
pay patients for
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
non-payment um are we starting to catch
 
01:46:43.350 --> 01:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
up with redetermining the
 
01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
still eligible or are we still lagging
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
and that's affecting
 
01:46:54.589 --> 01:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
their um Financial
 
01:46:58.589 --> 01:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
Heth um I think actually today well sort
 
01:47:00.669 --> 01:47:00.679 align:start position:0%
of simultaneous with this there was a
 
01:47:02.229 --> 01:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
presentation by the insurance department
 
01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the market but also
 
01:47:05.470 --> 01:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday in health Affairs there was an
 
01:47:07.709 --> 01:47:07.719 align:start position:0%
article published on kind of what's
 
01:47:10.510 --> 01:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
happened in terms of you know the
 
01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
closures and and how many people have
 
01:47:14.830 --> 01:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
found their way to other insurance um
 
01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
and I think that um what we've seen is
 
01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
that it's you know when they lose
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
Medicaid coverage and become
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
commercially ensure that that there are
 
01:47:26.750 --> 01:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
differences in what will be covered
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
under and that that I think is something
 
01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
that you know in terms of a goal to work
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
on with the uh New Hampshire Department
 
01:47:36.109 --> 01:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
of Insurance and other stakeholders is
 
01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
you know how do we sort of close that
 
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
Gap because I think one of the key
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
Services is functional
 
01:47:44.990 --> 01:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
supports um that there's not necessary
 
01:47:46.629 --> 01:47:46.639 align:start position:0%
alignment in terms of How It's viewed as
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
being a medical service or not um we
 
01:47:52.350 --> 01:47:52.360 align:start position:0%
also know that coming up is another um
 
01:47:55.870 --> 01:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
effort by by um CMS around um looking at
 
01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
parody of services so I think we have a
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
ways to go in terms of really getting to
 
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
True parody um of what is a covered
 
01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
service and so I think that's where the
 
01:48:11.629 --> 01:48:11.639 align:start position:0%
the um mental health centers are are um
 
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
having the struggle if you will um and
 
01:48:17.709 --> 01:48:17.719 align:start position:0%
then we also legislature approved you
 
01:48:21.629 --> 01:48:21.639 align:start position:0%
know um continuing to um have an annual
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
update on the the In-N-Out what we're
 
01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
hoping to see there is that fewer people
 
01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:28.719 align:start position:0%
um they'll have less bad debt as a
 
01:48:32.189 --> 01:48:32.199 align:start position:0%
result of moving that um as opposed to
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
just on an um an ad hoc basis but on a
 
01:48:38.589 --> 01:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
continual basis moving it with the U
 
01:48:40.189 --> 01:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price
 
01:48:44.030 --> 01:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
Index and um I think the the other piece
 
01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to the community the
 
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
certified community behavioral health
 
01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
centers that um the funding there and
 
01:48:53.229 --> 01:48:53.239 align:start position:0%
that model
 
01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
um there's an enhanced Federal match
 
01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
that comes with our participation in the
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
in that demonstration um um for the non
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
um granted Advantage population because
 
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
we're already at 90% but there's a 15 so
 
01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
rather than getting 50% we'll get 60
 
01:49:14.270 --> 01:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
um 65% for that population and so I
 
01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
think that in terms of like Nashville
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
and Manchester which are the first two
 
01:49:21.149 --> 01:49:21.159 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers to to
 
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
look at doing this that um some of the
 
01:49:26.229 --> 01:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
funding that comes through that program
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
I think will help support um um that uh
 
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
care though they have an
 
01:49:36.310 --> 01:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
obligation beyond what is in sort of our
 
01:49:39.390 --> 01:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
general um within that demonstration to
 
01:49:42.510 --> 01:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
accept all that that come into the to
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
the center um and I I'll let you add to
 
01:49:49.709 --> 01:49:49.719 align:start position:0%
that getting out of my no um just that
 
01:49:51.310 --> 01:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
we do work with the Community Mental
 
01:49:53.310 --> 01:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
Health Centers we do know that the
 
01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
redeterminations are a factor in that
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
information um that there may be
 
01:50:01.709 --> 01:50:01.719 align:start position:0%
individuals who lost coverage who could
 
01:50:05.669 --> 01:50:05.679 align:start position:0%
be eligible so we continue even um I
 
01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
think we're meeting in another week or
 
01:50:10.109 --> 01:50:10.119 align:start position:0%
two with a specific Community Mental
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
Health Center and we're talking about
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
how we can keep um either maintain uh
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid coverage or obtain Medicaid
 
01:50:21.149 --> 01:50:21.159 align:start position:0%
coverage if appropriate and um they're
 
01:50:25.149 --> 01:50:25.159 align:start position:0%
eligible also um I will point out that
 
01:50:27.390 --> 01:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
there is a state law that says that
 
01:50:29.550 --> 01:50:29.560 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers will
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
serve might be an administrative rule um
 
01:50:35.109 --> 01:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
as well um that they will serve all
 
01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
comers regardless of ability to pay
 
01:50:42.069 --> 01:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
however in the um budgeting process
 
01:50:44.830 --> 01:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
since 2011 there's been a provision that
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
suspends that portion of the law that
 
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
allows them to have weight lists um and
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
um and so that's been their back stop um
 
01:50:58.709 --> 01:50:58.719 align:start position:0%
it's not preferred but of course it is a
 
01:51:01.709 --> 01:51:01.719 align:start position:0%
necessity when they're unable to cover
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
those that are um underinsured or
 
01:51:07.709 --> 01:51:07.719 align:start position:0%
uninsured so um there is so many efforts
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
that are going on in this space and um
 
01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
we continue to work to try to close the
 
01:51:15.149 --> 01:51:15.159 align:start position:0%
gap and make sure people have coverage
 
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
but also that our system um has
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
sustainable funds and that they're able
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
to be fiscally um whole
 
01:51:27.310 --> 01:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
thank you one more follow up I good so I
 
01:51:29.550 --> 01:51:29.560 align:start position:0%
think we were all disappointed that
 
01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:30.950 align:start position:0%
think we were all disappointed that
solution

01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
solution
 
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
Health um was rejected by the town of
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
London Derry uh for their freestanding
 
01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:40.470 align:start position:0%
London Derry uh for their freestanding
psychiatric

01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
psychiatric
 
01:51:44.910 --> 01:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
hospital and we turned back those ARA
 
01:51:49.870 --> 01:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
funds and redistributed them elsewhere
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to solution health and they
 
01:51:54.189 --> 01:51:54.199 align:start position:0%
say they are
 
01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
still planning to build this hospital
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
they think they're set back for a year
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
but uh could you update us on what the
 
01:52:09.229 --> 01:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
department is doing to help them find a
 
01:52:12.109 --> 01:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
place get that project going so that
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
we're not sending people who need
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
inpatient treatment necessarily to the
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
more restrictive involuntary
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
commitments that insurance their
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage doesn't pay
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
for so um yes um the solution Health um
 
01:52:38.069 --> 01:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
situation in um the in with the uh Town
 
01:52:41.310 --> 01:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
Council yes we know about that we had a
 
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
deadline for our arpa funding and it has
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
been redirected and I'm very pleased
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
that um some of those funds have been
 
01:52:54.990 --> 01:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
redirected into um housing and so for um
 
01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
the fiscal Committee Action um which
 
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
allows us to be able to use that funding
 
01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:07.480 align:start position:0%
to provide um transitional housing for
 
01:53:11.149 --> 01:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
young adults so we know that there are
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
young adults at New Hampshire hospital
 
01:53:15.709 --> 01:53:15.719 align:start position:0%
who have could be discharged but they
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
have no place to go and so through this
 
01:53:20.669 --> 01:53:20.679 align:start position:0%
transitional housing um we're going to
 
01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
be able to um have
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
um not a lot of beds but some beds for
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
those and that will help for the acute
 
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
needs at New Hampshire hospital so that
 
01:53:34.750 --> 01:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
those um you know I I believe the number
 
01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
ranges but it's over 50 individuals at
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital who could be
 
01:53:42.830 --> 01:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
discharged they just need a place to go
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
and so this is going to relieve some of
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
that and some of our other community
 
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
efforts um Dartmouth is opening up five
 
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
beds drf beds so so that will be an
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
additional um uh expansion of drf um
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
beds in a place that needs them um and
 
01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
so we continue to work on the Community
 
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
Based Services as far as the discussions
 
01:54:09.790 --> 01:54:09.800 align:start position:0%
um with solution health I'm not involved
 
01:54:13.229 --> 01:54:13.239 align:start position:0%
in those um uh so um that would need to
 
01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.589 --> 01:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner I have a question but I
 
01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
have a lead in to the question to put it
 
01:54:23.550 --> 01:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
in this context
 
01:54:26.430 --> 01:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
restoration to competency not just so we
 
01:54:29.229 --> 01:54:29.239 align:start position:0%
can convict people but so we could
 
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
actually bring them to closure and often
 
01:54:34.629 --> 01:54:34.639 align:start position:0%
we have discovered testimony was given
 
01:54:37.069 --> 01:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
us that there have been people
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for a period longer than
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
what their sentence would be had they
 
01:54:44.830 --> 01:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
been found guilty with that in mind we
 
01:54:47.310 --> 01:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
have no intentional restoration of
 
01:54:49.709 --> 01:54:49.719 align:start position:0%
Competency program in the state if it
 
01:54:54.189 --> 01:54:54.199 align:start position:0%
happens it's a by chance the um forensic
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
people are saying it's not our job it's
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
a mental health issue some mental health
 
01:55:00.149 --> 01:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
people we talked to maybe not the right
 
01:55:02.109 --> 01:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
ones are saying it's not us it has to do
 
01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
with going to court meanwhile nothing is
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
happening our
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
committee our committee is charged for
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
one more
 
01:55:15.470 --> 01:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
year we would much rather work
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
collaboratively than impose a place by
 
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
legislation other states have this we
 
01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:22.830 align:start position:0%
legislation other states have this we
don't

01:55:22.830 --> 01:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
we would rather work with the
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate folks to do it right and
 
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
with a smile on everybody's face than
 
01:55:30.669 --> 01:55:30.679 align:start position:0%
simply saying if you're not going to
 
01:55:33.149 --> 01:55:33.159 align:start position:0%
play ball with us we're going to pass a
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
law I don't want to do that my question
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
is where in mental health do you see
 
01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:41.229 align:start position:0%
is where in mental health do you see
this

01:55:41.229 --> 01:55:41.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
Landing I understand um that there has
 
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
been um some robust discussion around
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
this and um I'm not going to weigh in um
 
01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
in particular one way or another there
 
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
but um I think that it is something that
 
01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
continues to need uh attention and work
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
and all the right people um and debate I
 
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
think debate is really really important
 
01:56:06.990 --> 01:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
in this process so that we do get it
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
right so that's me punting but I think
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
it again I I I think it's an important
 
01:56:16.350 --> 01:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
conversation well given my past
 
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
relations with the folks in the bureaus
 
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
plural I'm sure we'll have a good sit
 
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
down and we work hard on it together
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
because that's been my experience but we
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
may be giving you call after the first
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
of the year sounds great thank you
 
01:56:32.709 --> 01:56:32.719 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you any other
 
01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:36.199 align:start position:0%
questions anything
 
01:56:39.310 --> 01:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
further no um if there are questions
 
01:56:41.470 --> 01:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
about I think we could come to the next
 
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
meeting in um every single meeting and
 
01:56:47.709 --> 01:56:47.719 align:start position:0%
uh just spend time on one bullet point
 
01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
so if there's interest in any one
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
particular area for us to return be
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
happy to do so our agenda for next month
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
looks very very full but guess what
 
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
we'll do this again next year after
 
01:57:03.669 --> 01:57:03.679 align:start position:0%
November's meeting thank you for
 
01:57:06.669 --> 01:57:06.679 align:start position:0%

01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
that motion J well before we get to
 
01:57:13.390 --> 01:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
motion to a journ um don't throw away
 
01:57:16.030 --> 01:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
your lawn signs representative Murphy
 
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
after a couple of years off uh you'll be
 
01:57:22.270 --> 01:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
back um I certainly hope so uh
 
01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
representative Gary Woods gave us this
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
goodbye soong forever speech and he's
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
coming back and um I think a couple
 
01:57:32.910 --> 01:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
other folks are too even my one of my
 
01:57:34.589 --> 01:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
favorites in the house representative
 
01:57:36.990 --> 01:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
Shapiro has concluded he's not throwing
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
away his lawn signs either so we'll see
 
01:57:41.189 --> 01:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
you in a couple of years if not before
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
be careful what you wish for is all I
 
01:57:47.069 --> 01:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
can say so not always we are returned
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
the date of the next meeting is when the
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
