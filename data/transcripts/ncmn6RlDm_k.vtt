00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
morning I am going to open the public
 
00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 align:start position:0%
hearing for Senate Bill
 
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
504 and recognize the prime sponsor to
 
00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 align:start position:0%
introduce his
 
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
President good morning members of the
 
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee so pleased to be here for the
 
00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
record Jeb Bradley Senate District
 
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
three and sponsor of Senate Bill 504 I
 
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 align:start position:0%
was asked to sponsor this bill by the
 
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 align:start position:0%
governor um based
 
00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
on issues in the North country in terms
 
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
of um immigration and policy that we
 
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
have along our um northern border so
 
00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 align:start position:0%
currently right now um if you are a land
 
00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
owner and you post your land and um you
 
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 align:start position:0%
lose the extra 20% discount and there
 
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
are um mechanisms allowed for posting um
 
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
but it has to be done in such a way that
 
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
um would comply with the law so that
 
00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
people are still El eligible for current
 
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
use so if you look at the bill um it's
 
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
the new language is starting on line six
 
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
it says an owner of open space land may
 
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 align:start position:0%
post a no trespass sign except for
 
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
skiing snowmobile snowshoeing fishing
 
00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
hunting hiking or nature observation
 
00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 align:start position:0%
signs a prohibit restrict access um to
 
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
or use of such space land for any other
 
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 align:start position:0%
purpose so this will allow um land
 
00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
owners in current use to be able to post
 
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
their land against
 
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
trespassing um except for those
 
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
um activities outlined here so it's very
 
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
specific um and I worked with a couple
 
00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
of folks that are here this morning I'm
 
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
representing the timber owners and other
 
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
folks that are really uh concerned about
 
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
current use to do this in the correct
 
00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
way so that
 
00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 align:start position:0%
um there could be posting of land now
 
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
the purpose for the bill and the reason
 
00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
that uh the governor asked me to
 
00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
introduce it is
 
00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
the immigration issues and the northern
 
00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
border um security and people that are
 
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
illegal in this country crossing the
 
00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
border illegally and our law enforcement
 
00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
can do uh nothing about that um I don't
 
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
need to go into all of the issues
 
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
surrounding illegal immigration in the
 
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
United States we see it on the news
 
00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
every night but suffice it to say the
 
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
nor northern border is becoming more um
 
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
insecure as people realize that it's
 
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
relatively easy to cross um there have
 
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
been many Statistics over the Swanton
 
00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
sector um over the last year or so that
 
00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:20.759 align:start position:0%
highlight the large increase
 
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
percentage-wise in the number of people
 
00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 align:start position:0%
crossing the northern border um our
 
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
northern border along the 50 plus miles
 
00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
is um very rural very remote and very
 
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
hard um
 
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
for Customs and Border Patrol agents
 
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
that have been um the numbers have been
 
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
reduced in order to send some of these
 
00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 align:start position:0%
folks to the southern border so it is
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
much more insecure so the purpose of the
 
00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 align:start position:0%
bill is to allow local law enforcement
 
00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 align:start position:0%
um to have the ability to arrest for
 
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
trespass under state law um this does
 
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
not create a federal crime um any kind
 
00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 align:start position:0%
of federal issues would have to be done
 
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
through the border patrol but it would
 
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
allow local law enforcement to arrest
 
00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 align:start position:0%
for trespassing and better coordinate
 
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
with um Customs and Border Patrol so I'm
 
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
happy to try to answer any
 
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Senator Senator um
 
00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 align:start position:0%
we've heard some push back considering
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
statistics saying that you know the
 
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
numbers aren't really that high to
 
00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
justify this in your opinion does it
 
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
does it matter what the statistics are
 
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
if the do wide open the I think there
 
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
reasons why the numbers are not that
 
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 align:start position:0%
high resources have been taken away from
 
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
the northern border and it's very remote
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
so by the time um officers get to an
 
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
area where there might be you know
 
00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
reported incidents is that people are
 
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
gone and I've talked to folks that live
 
00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 align:start position:0%
you know on the northern border farmer
 
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
up there in particular Keith Robinson um
 
00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
who supplied a letter to the Senate and
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to get it to you um outlined
 
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
exactly that problem he has seen people
 
00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 align:start position:0%
um crossing the border illegally on his
 
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
property calls the appropriate
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
authorities by the time they get there
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
they're long gone so the statistics that
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
you know you are hearing you have to
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
take that into account less resources
 
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
Federal resources on the border and the
 
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
remoteness of it and and the fact that
 
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
by the time um CBP actually gets to the
 
00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 align:start position:0%
reported incident the folks are gone
 
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
because of the remoteness so why
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we want to empower local law
 
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement to um be able to work with
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
CBP to take action I mean it's not just
 
00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:57.879 align:start position:0%
drugs the northern border has become
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
increasingly less secure
 
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
for people on the terrorist watch list
 
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0%
crossing the border um this this is a
 
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
problem it's not just the 50 or so miles
 
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it is the
 
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
entire you know several thousand mile
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
northern border that is problematic but
 
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
we can only do what we can do in New
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is a small step um on top
 
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
of the provision that we placed into the
 
00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
budget last year the $1.4 million to
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
pay for local law enforcement to step up
 
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.510 align:start position:0%
pay for local law enforcement to step up
enforcement

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
issues further questions representative
 
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
Pratt good morning uh we presently the
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
fishing game I guess has no trespassing
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
signs that they make available will they
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
still will they be able to make signs
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
that say all this on
 
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
it so I think the way this um reads
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
that you would have to post according to
 
00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
what the current use statute says so you
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
would have to if you wanted to take the
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
additional discount you would have to
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
say no trespass except for those six um
 
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
items skiing snowshoeing fishing hunting
 
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
hiking or nature observation that's what
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
the current use law now allows so you
 
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
have to delineate that posting when I
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
originally sponsored the bill um it just
 
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919 align:start position:0%
said you prop post no trespassing that's
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
where the Timberland owners and and some
 
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
other folks who are here in the room um
 
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
came and and worked with the Attorney
 
00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
General's office on this specific
 
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
language to allow it to be in
 
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
conformance with um the current use
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
statute thank
 
00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
question um I'm I'm reading the bill and
 
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
I have some conf confusion because it
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
appears that there was some problem with
 
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
the way trespassing was posted before
 
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
that took away the the benefits you got
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
with current
 
00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
use and in the bill I see that the
 
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
trespassing signs need to be this spe
 
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
specific language to keep that benefit
 
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
is that right that is correct those
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
activities if you have your land in Cur
 
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
use and you get the discount for current
 
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
use plus the additional
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
discount if you're going to remain in
 
00:09:39.389 --> 00:09:39.399 align:start position:0%
current use you have to allow those
 
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
activities so unless you are partaking
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
of those activities then that's when you
 
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.389 align:start position:0%
would be
trespassing

00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
trespassing
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
followup so my followup if it's all just
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
about changing the trespassing for
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
property in New Hampshire I hear all of
 
00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
the other discussion about the board
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
coordination with the border the
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
problems with the Border all of those
 
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
kind of things and I'm wondering where
 
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
is it in this
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill that addresses that and has changed
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
anything in reference between the law as
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
it current used to exist as it exists
 
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
now and as this changes it so you get
 
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
the coordination and how it's going to
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
help with the Border okay so what this
 
00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
bill would do is allow for local law
 
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement to be able to interdict
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
somebody trespassing except for those
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
delineated activities so if somebody is
 
00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:42.519 align:start position:0%
walking across the border illegally
 
00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
they're not um skiing or snowshoeing or
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
fishing hunting hiking okay so by virtue
 
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.389 align:start position:0%
fishing hunting hiking okay so by virtue
of

00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
creating the opportunity for PE for law
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
enforcement to arrest somebody who is
 
00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
crossing the border illegally
 
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
trespassing but still allowing the
 
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
property owners who have their property
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
in current
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
use um most of which is along the
 
00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:12.519 align:start position:0%
northern border of the private property
 
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
on the border that is in current use
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
that is what creates the opportunity for
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
federal I mean for state law enforcement
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.030 align:start position:0%
 
laws

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.670 align:start position:0%
laws
quick

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
quick
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
followup so to be arrested for
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
trespassing they would have to be on
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
land that is posted correctly that's
 
00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:42.839 align:start position:0%
correct other places there's no
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
difference between the border and if
 
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
they're not trespassing it doesn't help
 
00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:49.959 align:start position:0%
border if land were not in current use
 
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
you could post just a no trespassing
 
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
sign a current use to get the additional
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
discount you would have to post in this
 
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair um how is a law
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer going to determine
 
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
whether someone is hiking or whether
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
they're crossing the border uh they
 
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.230 align:start position:0%
they're crossing the border uh they
would

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:17.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
obviously talk to people see what they
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
were doing and you know obviously if you
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
are skiing you have skis on if you're
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
snowshoeing you have snowshoes on
 
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
fishing you have fishing
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
parapan Alia hunting same thing I think
 
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
obvious I would suggest that hiking
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
would be part of a a the criminal
 
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
investigation where they would say you
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
know where where you from where you
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
heading um do do you have the perel for
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
hiking you got or are you just I mean
 
00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:52.519 align:start position:0%
that would be a probable cause issue
 
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
that'll end up probably in the court um
 
00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.710 align:start position:0%
that'll end up probably in the court um
representative

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:12:59.790 --> 00:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you for taking my question
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
given the remoteness of the area and the
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
100 fot posting requirement uh and the
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
fact that quite a bit of land up there
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
isn't already current use one of the
 
00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:12.519 align:start position:0%
things I'm wondering is just how much
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
additional protection uh this is going
 
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
to provide so has anybody actually
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
looked at how many people may
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
actually uh take up an offer like this
 
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh and what level of impact would it
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
actually have on the situation
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
well I think every little bit
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
helps um obviously there's a lot of
 
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
public land along the border but there
 
00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:40.839 align:start position:0%
is um private land in current use I
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
spoken to you know a farmer who owns um
 
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:48.519 align:start position:0%
I I think he said a 230 Acre Farm on the
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
border his name is Keith Robinson who
 
00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:53.759 align:start position:0%
has seen people crossing the border
 
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
illegally and by the time he has um you
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
know phoned it into authorities and
 
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
given the remoteness of the area um by
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
the time authorities arrive they're long
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
helps see you no further questions uh
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr President for your time and
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%

649 A2 and would read child means any
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
person under the age of 18 years or
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
something which is portrayed to be a
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
person under the age of 18 and therefore
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
indistinguishable from a
 
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
child the scourge of people abusing
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
children in the production of child sex
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
abuse imagery exploiting those children
 
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
for life by selling and exchanging those
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
images and videos on the internet and in
 
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
the black market exchanges can be
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
addressed by this
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
legislature we are very fortunate to in
 
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to have the internet
 
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
crimes against children task force
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
investigating these kinds of
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
crimes it has been my honor and pleasure
 
00:30:55.629 --> 00:30:55.639 align:start position:0%
to work with the internet crimes against
 
00:30:59.230 --> 00:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
children task force uh from my previous
 
00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
work in advocacy for abused children and
 
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
then subsequently in my work here as a
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
member of the house and now in the
 
00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
Senate um it is
 
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that we need them but what
 
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
they do is
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
invaluable the uh Lieutenant Eric
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
Kinsman could not be here today because
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
is my understanding that the internet
 
00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
crimes against children task force is
 
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
conducting a number of raids
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
today um we are very very fortunate to
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
have Holly Ray here from the from the
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
task force and I believe she'll be
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
testifying a little bit
 
00:31:45.629 --> 00:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
later we what we can do to assist them
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
in fiing out these perpetrators of
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
violence against children is to
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the rapid changes in
 
00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:54.519 align:start position:0%
software and the way that they are being
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
used in criminal Enterprise I have a
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
attached my testimony says I have
 
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
attached two articles that is true you
 
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
have two articles but you also have an
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
opinion piece um from uh Pitzer
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
prizewinning author Nicholas Kristoff
 
00:32:13.629 --> 00:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:32:13.639 --> 00:32:15.149 align:start position:0%
about this
Scourge

00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
Scourge
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
um these articles uh explain the issues
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
associated with the rapid evolution of
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
child sex abuse imagery in the
 
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence space New
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can't wait for the artificial
 
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
intelligence world to police itself and
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
if practice is precedent they won't
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 564 is an important change
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
in the law and I hope you will recommend
 
00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:44.519 align:start position:0%
it ought to pass as quickly as possible
 
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and attention
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
and I am open to any
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Senator um it's my
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
understanding that the the ACLU has
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
taking a negative position on this bill
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
and they're they're claim claiming the
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
Free Speech exception based on a Case
 
00:33:03.629 --> 00:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
called Ashcraft that dealt with
 
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
something like this but not in my
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
opinion like this because they never the
 
00:33:10.269 --> 00:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
Ashcraft Court didn't have to contend
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
with the AI technology that exists now
 
00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:16.519 align:start position:0%
and I I would submit that they may have
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
a different opinion um have you had a
 
00:33:20.669 --> 00:33:20.679 align:start position:0%
chance to discuss this at all with them
 
00:33:23.789 --> 00:33:23.799 align:start position:0%
or um no I have not and this is the
 
00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
first I'm hearing that the ACLU is in
 
00:33:29.629 --> 00:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
are you saying oppos or just raising
 
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
questions pretty pretty clear opposition
 
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
okay um well I will I will share with
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
the committee that it has been my
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
experience in working um for laws that
 
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
protect criminal
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
victims uh that the ACLU has not
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily been a partner in protecting
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
the rights of the people who have been
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
harmed by criminals in so much as
 
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
protecting the rights of the criminals
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
so um I you can take that for what you
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
will but I I have yet to have a criminal
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
victim's Justice bill that they have
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
embraced so there you are I I did um I I
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
raised their concerns with the Attorney
 
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
General's office and they seem to be
 
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
also of the opinion that the Reliance on
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
that older case um that Court did not
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
have ai in front of them it wasn't even
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
existing at that point which makes a big
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
difference so thank you chairman Roy I
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you brought that up with
 
00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
them with the Attorney General's office
 
00:34:40.109 --> 00:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
because AI um in the use
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
of of
 
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
um abusing young children and older
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
teens um has
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
proliferated absolutely proliferated and
 
00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
created an entire New Market where real
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
faces of real children from our state
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
are superimposed on sexually graphic and
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
horrific horrific sexual crimes and once
 
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
something's out there you can't unring
 
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
the bell and we want to at least provide
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
a space um for law enforcement to be
 
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
able to act and um for the law to make
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
space for those
 
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
victims thank you questions for Senator
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
representative seig and then
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative PR thank you Mr chair and
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I just
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
wondered if you had seen the story in
 
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
Monday's New York Times um entitled teen
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
girls confront an epidemic of deep fake
 
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
nudes at schools that addressed um it's
 
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
a reporter who did an investigative
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
piece that started with a case in New
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
Jersey that um revealed similar issues
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
to what you're showing but also talked
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
about the struggles because they don't
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
have the laws in place yet to address it
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
um yeah actually one of the articles
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
that you have addresses um originally
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
the New Jersey problem and what the
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
struggles are in states that for where
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
victims are coming forward and law
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement has nothing there's no way
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
to charge this because it AI is a new
 
00:36:21.069 --> 00:36:21.079 align:start position:0%
it's a whole new
 
00:36:25.309 --> 00:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
chapter and unfortunately we're late
 
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
we're late we have to catch up before um
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
more people are sucked into this
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt hello hi thanks for
 
00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question my pleasure um I
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
agree with everything you said and uh I
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
like the changes in the first paragraph
 
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
here but I have questions about page two
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
line 11 okay um doesn't allowing
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
drawings cartoons sculptures and
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.630 align:start position:0%
 
problem

00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:36:59.950 --> 00:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
basically it says they're going to
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
exempt anything in those
 
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.910 align:start position:0%
exempt anything in those
areas

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.710 align:start position:0%
areas
um

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
so I agree with you um are you looking
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
at the definition exceptions on 13 and
 
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
um so indistinguishable is the new
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
definition which we do want for IND
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
distinguishable indistinguishable
 
00:37:32.589 --> 00:37:32.599 align:start position:0%
meaning virtually indistinguishable that
 
00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
if I saw your face in one of these
 
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
videos um the depiction would be such
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
that any person here viewing it would
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
conclude that the depiction is actually
 
00:37:50.349 --> 00:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
of you even if it wasn't but an ordinary
 
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
person could would say oh that's
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt and that is a harm
 
00:37:58.829 --> 00:37:58.839 align:start position:0%
to you um
 
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
in order to um address some concerns
 
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
that were coming out of other groups the
 
00:38:08.589 --> 00:38:08.599 align:start position:0%
definition carved out drawings cartoons
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
sculptures and
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
paintings depicting minors or adults as
 
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
that fell into some First Amendment and
 
00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.309 align:start position:0%
that fell into some First Amendment and
satirical

00:38:21.309 --> 00:38:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
boundaries thank you I don't love it but
 
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
it's where we are yeah I would love if
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
you would love of this and sta passing
 
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
it and we can both not love that part
 
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:33.400 align:start position:0%
and maybe do something about it later
 
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
that I follow up please yeah I just I do
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
believe there is a a Supreme Court case
 
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
that deals with cartoons and things of
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
that nature which would have to be
 
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
overturned for us to be able to do this
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead fall they fall into satire yeah
 
00:38:50.109 --> 00:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
and and political commentary so it's
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
it's a rocky road there so that there's
 
00:38:54.309 --> 00:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
the carve out that's the piece I see
 
00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
being used in local libraries as a uh is
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
a uh way out of taking something out
 
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be in the
 
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
library it's a cartoon or it's a
 
00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
artwork okay thank
 
00:39:10.109 --> 00:39:10.119 align:start position:0%

such images some of which have included

conduct making the possession of this
 
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.160 align:start position:0%

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:42.920 align:start position:0%

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
Predators it could also further prevent

the exploitation of Children online
 
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the internet has become a
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
place child Predators L lure groom
 
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:start position:0%

00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
material transfer it that was never
 
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
previously possible as technology
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
evolves it's imperative that the law
 
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
keeps up in order to protect the most
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
vulnerable members of our
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
society that is all I have for everyone
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the time and I'm happy to
 
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
take any
 
00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Sergeant um so
 
00:42:20.589 --> 00:42:20.599 align:start position:0%
basically what what can happen now as my
 
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is someone who interacts
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
with children be it a coach a mentor
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
whatever could take a picture of a minor
 
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
a female Minor's face or male and have
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
that program superimpose it into an
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
existing pornography movie whereas the
 
00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
person in the pornography movie is for
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
all intents and purposes that child is
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
that correct yes essentially sir okay
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
and based on your training and
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
experience when uh a predator like this
 
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
isn't that really the first step before
 
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
they start moving on to actually
 
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
contacting and touching and or abducting
 
00:42:54.549 --> 00:42:54.559 align:start position:0%
and hurting that child yes there has
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
been a uh a high correlation in the I's
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
experience between people that view
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
child sexual abuse imagery and that are
 
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:04.990 align:start position:0%
child sexual abuse imagery and that are
touch

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
touch
 
00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
offenders thank you further questions
 
00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:09.640 align:start position:0%
represent wheeler thank you Mr chairman
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
this will be a quick question thank you
 
00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
Sergeant for taking my question I just
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
want to know how prolific a problem this
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
is in New Hampshire and if there are
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
more resources that are that should be
 
00:43:22.109 --> 00:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
allocated to a program like gak to make
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
sure that we can deal with this this is
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
horrific in my opinion um thank you for
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
your question sir
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
um I think the best I think the iak task
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
force may have a better idea of in
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
general what resources would really help
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
the task force itself um however I can
 
00:43:44.549 --> 00:43:44.559 align:start position:0%
say that um unfortunately child The
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
Possession distribution and child sexual
 
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
abuse imagery material crimes um are a
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
huge issue in our state um I think we
 
00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
have great laws in place to help law
 
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement combat it um and this
 
00:44:02.589 --> 00:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
addition would be extremely beneficial
 
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
to that fight against crimes against
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
children further questions
 
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:08.870 align:start position:0%
children further questions
representative

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
seig thank you and thank you for taking
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
my question um to follow up on chairman
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
Roy's question about um people using
 
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
this so if someone were to make one of
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
these deep fake type of things for a
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
minor um are are people using it to do
 
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
things like essentially blackmail them
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
into sending real imagery potentially or
 
00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:33.079 align:start position:0%
to like in addition to trying to groom
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
them uh for actual physical abuse um I'm
 
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
not phrasing my question well I'm sorry
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
but are people using this for the
 
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
purposes of sort of you know kids are
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
Gable often I as a parent of teenager um
 
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:49.720 align:start position:0%
you know I can see how this can lead to
 
00:44:51.069 --> 00:44:51.079 align:start position:0%
that but is that one of the methods that
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
they're using is to I I'm not familiar
 
00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
with a specific case ma'am and thank you
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
for your question um
 
00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:00.839 align:start position:0%
however the idea of something such as
 
00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
revenge porn or um a child who does
 
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
happen to send a a nude selfie um I have
 
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
dealt with and we do have a number of
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
cases that do involve that I just don't
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
know one um in my experience yet of one
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
that was technically AI generated um
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
however the the uh the blackmail
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
situation is a definite offense and like
 
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
you said kids are unfortunately very
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
vulnerable especially in the social
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
media World um and one thing predators
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
do do is they are able to convince them
 
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
to send some sort of sexually explicit
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
photo of themselves and then in
 
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
turn essentially blackmail them either
 
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
into sending additional photos to that
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
Predator I can only assume that that
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
will be a problem in the AI world as
 
00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your
 
00:45:56.109 --> 00:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
question Sergeant I also it occurs to me
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
that um not only Predators this is
 
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
probably going to develop into um other
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
teenagers getting access to this and
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
creating videos of young women and
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
posting them and we could end up with
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
suicides and things of that nature based
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
on would you agree that that's a
 
00:46:15.549 --> 00:46:15.559 align:start position:0%
possibility yes sir I I would I would um
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
strongly agree that that is a
 
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
possibility um and again for lack of
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
term I think the most common term for it
 
00:46:24.549 --> 00:46:24.559 align:start position:0%
is revenge porn and we are we are seeing
 
00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
that as a um unfortunate um part of AI
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
technology um I'm sure a few of you have
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
maybe read instances of celebrities um
 
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
deep fakes of celebrities going on and
 
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
basically imposed in pornographic videos
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
um and to be quite Frank most of the
 
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
most of the things I read in the news do
 
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
pertain to AI being utilized in
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
pornographic material thank you
 
00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt thank you for
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question um it's pretty much
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
the same one I before page two line 13
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
and 14 right now the irsa does not
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
exempt drawings cartoons sculptures and
 
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
paintings but that line there does
 
00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
exempt drawings cartoons sculptures and
 
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
paintings that depict a minor or an
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
adult so does that weaken this bill this
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh this
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
RSA um because it it um because it
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
excludes the drawings cartoons sir yes
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
cartoons drawings sculptures
 
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
it is not Exempted in the previous right
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
now in the
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
RSA I I think and to expand on what the
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
senator was saying before me um the
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
problem with the cartoons drawings and
 
00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
sculptures and paintings is is the term
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
indistinguishable um it's it's very
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
important in when we are reviewing
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
digital evidence and when we do find
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
evidence of child sexual abuse material
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's very important for me to be
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
able to say that that is a child um and
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
one of the ways I do look for are
 
00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:03.270 align:start position:0%
one of the ways I do look for are
certain

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:48:05.309 --> 00:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
characteristics I think it would be very
 
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
hard for me to note those
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
characteristics and to be able to report
 
00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
on those characteristics when it's a
 
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
drawing or cartoon or
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
sculpture I believe that might be the
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
the difficulty with that definition sir
 
00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
just f one for
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
up would we be better off just to leave
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
that line out line 13 through
 
00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:31.190 align:start position:0%
that line out line 13 through
14

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh I'm
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
not I guess I'm not sure I feel like I
 
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
leave that up to you folks and your and
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh you have a little more um uh
 
00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
experience with this than I do so thank
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
sir represent
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
pass anyone else see you no further
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone for your time I
 
00:48:59.309 --> 00:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate it any is anyone else wishing
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
to testify in this bill who has not done
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
so seeing no one I here by close the
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
executive S I mean excuse me the public
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
hearing we reconvene at 1:00 is that
 
00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:25.710 align:start position:0%
hearing we reconvene at 1:00 is that

I'll speak to my
 
03:04:25.429 --> 03:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
motion um this amendment replaces the
 
03:04:28.790 --> 03:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
entire Bill there there were um a few
 
03:04:33.110 --> 03:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
minor Provisions that um didn't keep the
 
03:04:34.510 --> 03:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
copy that they gave me to see the
 
03:04:37.469 --> 03:04:37.479 align:start position:0%
provisions but it has a new paragraph
 
03:04:39.510 --> 03:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
that is associated with another
 
03:04:39.520 --> 03:04:41.550 align:start position:0%
that is associated with another
appropriate

03:04:41.550 --> 03:04:41.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:04:44.229 --> 03:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
RSA and so they corrected the language
 
03:04:46.349 --> 03:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
and the language has been corrected and
 
03:04:49.630 --> 03:04:49.640 align:start position:0%
uh I commend like I said ought to pass
 
03:04:51.790 --> 03:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
with Amendment thank you representative
 
03:04:53.670 --> 03:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
RS would you like to speak to your
 
03:04:55.830 --> 03:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
second the only thing I would add Mr
 
03:04:57.990 --> 03:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
chair is I I do remember last I think it
 
03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
was last week when we heard this bill um
 
03:05:03.790 --> 03:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
we formed that quick little subcommittee
 
03:05:06.950 --> 03:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
and representative Newman fixed whatever
 
03:05:08.110 --> 03:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
whatever the concern was I'm trying to
 
03:05:10.150 --> 03:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
find the bill myself in like five
 
03:05:12.550 --> 03:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
minutes and then you we were able to
 
03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
just kind of dis dissolve the
 
03:05:15.389 --> 03:05:15.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee because it wasn't really
 
03:05:18.150 --> 03:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
necessary if that's that's pretty much
 
03:05:19.910 --> 03:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
how I right that that's exactly what
 
03:05:21.950 --> 03:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
happened and the appropriate language is
 
03:05:23.469 --> 03:05:23.479 align:start position:0%
in there and I was getting ready to
 
03:05:27.389 --> 03:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
compare the amendment to the bill as as
 
03:05:29.830 --> 03:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
submitted and unfortunately we went
 
03:05:31.309 --> 03:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
through though I've never seen us go
 
03:05:34.790 --> 03:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
through three bills so fast so anyway um
 
03:05:36.110 --> 03:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
that's where it stands if I could
 
03:05:38.429 --> 03:05:38.439 align:start position:0%
inquire and the stakeholders are happy
 
03:05:40.349 --> 03:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
with this
 
03:05:42.429 --> 03:05:42.439 align:start position:0%
amendment believe some of them here and
 
03:05:43.910 --> 03:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
they might be able to help me out of
 
03:05:45.830 --> 03:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
what actually changed in it yeah if if
 
03:05:48.309 --> 03:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't mind um just telling us
 
03:05:49.990 --> 03:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
that you're happy with the changes and
 
03:05:56.070 --> 03:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:58.469 --> 03:05:58.479 align:start position:0%

think um we discussed with some of the

03:09:21.229 --> 03:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit and so we're going to
 
03:09:23.710 --> 03:09:23.720 align:start position:0%

03:09:27.830 --> 03:09:27.840 align:start position:0%

03:09:37.030 --> 03:09:37.040 align:start position:0%

Murray would you like to speak to your
 
03:09:54.429 --> 03:09:54.439 align:start position:0%
motion representative yes um the fact
 
03:09:58.830 --> 03:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
that AI has really gone crazy throughout
 
03:10:00.349 --> 03:10:00.359 align:start position:0%
the United States and in New Hampshire
 
03:10:02.429 --> 03:10:02.439 align:start position:0%
as well I think this is a great
 
03:10:05.030 --> 03:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
protection for our young
 
03:10:06.830 --> 03:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
folks thank you would you like to speak
 
03:10:08.670 --> 03:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
to your second representative
 
03:10:12.590 --> 03:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
maray um I am all set thank you I would
 
03:10:14.750 --> 03:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
just add that I I think this is a uh a
 
03:10:17.389 --> 03:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
good bill and a good first step um it
 
03:10:20.030 --> 03:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
may end up it may end up testing the the
 
03:10:23.550 --> 03:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
legal field um of the existing jurist
 
03:10:26.229 --> 03:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
Prudence with the Ashcraft case which as
 
03:10:28.630 --> 03:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
I said before did not address AI so it'
 
03:10:29.910 --> 03:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
be interesting to see where this goes
 
03:10:31.269 --> 03:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
but I think it's a good step towards
 
03:10:33.550 --> 03:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
protecting our children so I would also
 
03:10:35.389 --> 03:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
urge the members to support the a to
 
03:10:37.870 --> 03:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
pass motion um any further
 
03:10:41.790 --> 03:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:44.469 --> 03:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
Muse one thing that I wanted to bring up
 
03:10:47.870 --> 03:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
is we do understand um the difference uh
 
03:10:49.389 --> 03:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
between this bill and some of the other
 
03:10:52.150 --> 03:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
things that we passed um earlier in the
 
03:10:55.670 --> 03:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
session we we passed a similar Bill uh
 
03:10:59.030 --> 03:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
that would essentially make the uh the
 
03:11:02.309 --> 03:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
non-consensual use of uh pornographic
 
03:11:05.309 --> 03:11:05.319 align:start position:0%
sexualized imagery um a crime in New
 
03:11:07.070 --> 03:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're in effect we're adding
 
03:11:10.710 --> 03:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
it to our revenge Port porn Statute in
 
03:11:13.710 --> 03:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
this particular case this particular
 
03:11:16.229 --> 03:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
Bill does not require a particular
 
03:11:20.110 --> 03:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
individual uh to be harmed uh as I read
 
03:11:22.910 --> 03:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
the bill what it could do uh is
 
03:11:24.830 --> 03:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
essentially make it possible for
 
03:11:28.830 --> 03:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who is uh uh possessing and
 
03:11:32.070 --> 03:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
circulating uh an a composite image of a
 
03:11:33.670 --> 03:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
child to be
 
03:11:37.550 --> 03:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
prosecuted I feel um based on what I've
 
03:11:40.950 --> 03:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
heard about the market for pornography
 
03:11:44.030 --> 03:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
and about how
 
03:11:46.229 --> 03:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
the essentially
 
03:11:46.239 --> 03:11:47.950 align:start position:0%
the essentially
what

03:11:47.950 --> 03:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:11:50.469 --> 03:11:50.479 align:start position:0%
what you know the the dilemma I think
 
03:11:52.309 --> 03:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
faced you know by our our law
 
03:11:56.830 --> 03:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh folks I I feel that the
 
03:12:00.269 --> 03:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
that composite images today are are so
 
03:12:03.389 --> 03:12:03.399 align:start position:0%
realistic that um many of them even with
 
03:12:06.190 --> 03:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
the technology we have available today
 
03:12:08.429 --> 03:12:08.439 align:start position:0%
they're virtually indistinguishable from
 
03:12:11.469 --> 03:12:11.479 align:start position:0%
from that of a real child and and what
 
03:12:14.150 --> 03:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
what this particular Market does what
 
03:12:17.190 --> 03:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
what these images do is they create a
 
03:12:20.349 --> 03:12:20.359 align:start position:0%
market for more images so whether it's a
 
03:12:22.269 --> 03:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
mar whether it's an image of a real
 
03:12:26.110 --> 03:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
child or whether it's a very realistic
 
03:12:29.349 --> 03:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
composite image of of a child that never
 
03:12:32.950 --> 03:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
existed essentially we're talking about
 
03:12:35.550 --> 03:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
the same thing and we're also talking
 
03:12:37.950 --> 03:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
about the fact that the very fact that a
 
03:12:40.670 --> 03:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
market for this type of material exists
 
03:12:43.229 --> 03:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
means that if we allow that market to
 
03:12:46.269 --> 03:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
continue to exist real children are
 
03:12:48.429 --> 03:12:48.439 align:start position:0%
going to be harmed so I I think it's
 
03:12:50.990 --> 03:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
important that we pass this
 
03:12:53.349 --> 03:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you further discussion
 
03:12:56.229 --> 03:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative sik thank you very much I
 
03:12:57.790 --> 03:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
I just would like to say as the parent
 
03:13:01.030 --> 03:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
of teenagers and knowing how incredibly
 
03:13:03.389 --> 03:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
impressionable and how easily persuaded
 
03:13:05.710 --> 03:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
they are by things that may or may not
 
03:13:09.110 --> 03:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
be accurate um and and the risk for them
 
03:13:13.429 --> 03:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
to be subjected to um people using
 
03:13:15.150 --> 03:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
images that they've created artificially
 
03:13:18.190 --> 03:13:18.200 align:start position:0%
for blackmail or sex tortion
 
03:13:20.550 --> 03:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
um that it's really crucial to pass
 
03:13:22.229 --> 03:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
legislation like this for the sake of
 
03:13:23.309 --> 03:13:23.319 align:start position:0%
all of our
 
03:13:26.910 --> 03:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
