somewhere else in a few moments as well
 
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
so it's going to be a sporadic day in
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to get some of these
 
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
execs done I'd like to First recognize
 
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:44.120 align:start position:0%

looking forward to what an interest
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%

it may be sporadic here so what I'd like
 
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
to do is jump right into uh the first
 
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
bill which we'd like to uh address and
 
00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
that is um a commission to study current
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:40.519 align:start position:0%
1176 and I'm going to hand the gavel off
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
to representa cordelli uh thank you Mr
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
chairman and I call on the chairman for
 
00:31:48.269 --> 00:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
a motion I'd like to recommend inum
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
study second second by representative
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
Miler a discussion from uh the uh maker
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
of the motion yes I I'll try to be as
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
timely and quick as possible uh the the
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
issue of special education is a an issue
 
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
which has been upon us for years uh not
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
just a differentiated Aid component of
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
special education but catastrophic Aid
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
and how we fund that and support the
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
students that receive that type of Aid
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
and support and we know that the cost of
 
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
doing uh special education work in
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
schools is is costly due to the fact we
 
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
have 13 different IEPs some requiring
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
less time than others and we've
 
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
currently fund differentiated Aid at one
 
00:32:33.549 --> 00:32:33.559 align:start position:0%
level per all IEPs and then when we get
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
into the business of catastropic Aid it
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
even is more costly with the formula we
 
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
have and you all know that the first
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
first part is the responsibility of the
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
school district paying three and a half
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
times the average cost per pupil for and
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
that comes right out of um the pockets
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
of the school district that would be up
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
to 70 $770,000 if the average cost is at
 
00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
$20,000 per
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
kid and thereafter up to 10 times the
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
state kicks in 80% the local school
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
district has to give it kick in 20% and
 
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
beyond that 10 times the state kicks in
 
00:33:12.029 --> 00:33:12.039 align:start position:0%
however that leaves the Local District
 
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
having to pay an awful lot of money and
 
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
there's need for us to look at it we've
 
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
had several bills come to us in recent
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
years dropping cat aid from 2 and 1/2
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
times I put that from 3 and 1 half to 2
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
and a/ half times I put that in several
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
years back that went nowhere
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
uh we have another one that's come in at
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
funding at at one and a half times um
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
we're we're dealing with that uh now
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
it's time to really get serious and
 
00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:36.679 align:start position:0%
figure out what we're going to do
 
00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
interim study is the best way to handle
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
this rather than a commission a
 
00:33:42.269 --> 00:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
commission wouldn't get going on it
 
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
until probably fall um we need to have
 
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
resolution to this as quickly as
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
possible interim study we can get on it
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
right now and we can put a group
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
together and start working out those
 
00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
areas which need correction and there
 
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
are a lot of areas that need support and
 
00:34:04.269 --> 00:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
correction within how we fund and pay
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
for uh special education so I I
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
recommend interim
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
study uh represent Miler anything uh

yes I I would um there there are some
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
issues and concerns which we have to
 
00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
look at at this and I thought at the
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
same time we're
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
studying uh with the previous bill which
 
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
we've just looked at as far as special
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
education funding event and programming
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
supporting special education we need to
 
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
be cognizant of uh a directive put out
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
by the US Department of Education it's
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
coordinating early intervening Services
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
it's called CIS and it's a guidance uh
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
memo to school districts and it says
 
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
that using these federal funds um they
 
00:36:38.109 --> 00:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
can be used to provide behavioral
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
interventions for students positive
 
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
behavior interventions and support
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
initiatives which are you those students
 
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:46.839 align:start position:0%
that make the frequent stop at the
 
00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
principal's door or the principal's
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
bench uh there's ways to work with
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
students and the monies can be used to
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
offset uh going further with um
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh issues that may end up with special
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
education um also CIS uh might be used
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
to help funding reading or math
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
Specialists to work with non-disabled
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
students who have not reached grade
 
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
level or proficiency so you can use
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
special education monies even though the
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
student doesn't have an IEP but
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
demonstrates that they're quote in that
 
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
area of remedial reading or remedial
 
00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
math and they need support so they don't
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
go the route of special educ
 
00:37:30.309 --> 00:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
ation monies can also be used for after
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
school tutoring for non-disabled
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
students who score below basic or
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessments so here's another
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
area that monies can be used and then
 
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
I'd like to put my administrator hat on
 
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
and I've said it to the committee before
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
if you're at the end of the year and you
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
have a balance of money in your accounts
 
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
and the fuel tanks are empty and you
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
know the price of fuel is going up in
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
coming years do you use use that money
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
that you have available to you know
 
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.200 align:start position:0%
offset those costs of fuel and and pay
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
for the fuel now or do you not put in
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
some kind of a a trust or whatever and
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
spend the additional dollars for filling
 
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
up the tank later on when you have the
 
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
money's appropriated in the next budget
 
00:38:16.349 --> 00:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
cycle I as an administrator always chose
 
00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
to fill the tanks
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
up so that's my uh response to why we
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
need to interum study this um I
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
understand the nature and the intent of
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
the Bill however there's there is
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
conflicts uh with aspects of the bill
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
and I think it can be all sorted out
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
with um a study an interim study along
 
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
when we're studying the other for the
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%

1176 as we look at the whole issue of

districts and definition of that and the
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
about that um as well um and that is
 
00:43:28.829 --> 00:43:28.839 align:start position:0%
something that we had mentioned uh to

00:44:31.549 --> 00:44:31.559 align:start position:0%
Commerce Insurance sub committee yeah
 
00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
and you're working on a bill
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
IIT yes I remember I remember yes so
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
yes am still trying to have really clear
 
00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
concise data to show how I don't that
 
00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:58.790 align:start position:0%
concise data to show how I don't that
anymore

00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
yes yes that of course not it's not as
 
00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
powerful it's not convincing
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
exists even though I'm not there
 
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
anymore anybody doesn't
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
know even you may not know you know
 
00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
diabetes but everyone does yes but most
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
of us actually know someone diabetes and
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
know that they have diabetes yes I
 
00:45:33.549 --> 00:45:33.559 align:start position:0%
think early in Myer a lot of people with
 
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
diabetes didn't speak out about it and
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
that's the best way for them to be able
 
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
to take care of themselves I guess I was
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
fortunate because I would actually have
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.880 --> 00:50:54.430 align:start position:0%
 
were

00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.440 --> 01:18:21.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.920 --> 01:19:06.110 align:start position:0%

a substitute in on our committee that
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%

sponsor of the bill with the Attorney
 
01:24:18.189 --> 01:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
General's office to just clarify a small
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
amount of language just to make it clear
 
01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
and I think the bill itself is is fine
 
01:24:26.189 --> 01:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
as is but this would just further
 
01:24:29.629 --> 01:24:29.639 align:start position:0%
highlight that we're not looking to
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
allow speech on colleges that would
 
01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise be prohibited by law such as
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
threats and incitement to um to violence
 
01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:41.719 align:start position:0%

protections for free speech on college
 
01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
campuses and Association on college

that the protections that are generally
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
afforded by our constitution by our
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%

campuses as are reasonable for the
 
01:27:59.950 --> 01:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
environment we understand that there
 
01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
can't be total free speech on college
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
campuses you can't have students yelling
 
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
during class and such like
 
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
that um the reason the rationale for
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward is that is that
 
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
this committee has heard um a number of
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
different times that the approach taken
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
at some colleges and universities is not
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
entirely even-handed and it is not
 
01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
entirely without Viewpoint
 
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
discrimination we've heard from students
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh of some small conservative or
 
01:28:29.629 --> 01:28:29.639 align:start position:0%
organizations testify that they were
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
subjected to increased degrees of
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
scrutiny that other organizations were
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
not we further
 
01:28:38.719 --> 01:28:40.709 align:start position:0%
not we further
heard

01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:40.719 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:28:40.719 --> 01:28:42.870 align:start position:0%
heard
sure

01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
understood I think we're all
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
set we further heard testimony from a
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
different group a different small
 
01:28:54.030 --> 01:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
conserv group that they were uh told
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
they had to shut down a two-person
 
01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
tabling event because they they failed
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
to receive a permit and they admitted
 
01:29:01.149 --> 01:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
they were failed to receive a permit the
 
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
university confirmed that it was their
 
01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
policy to always refuse to allow
 
01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
unpermitted events to go forward but
 
01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
when we got our hands on the actual
 
01:29:13.109 --> 01:29:13.119 align:start position:0%
database of University records for 2023
 
01:29:15.109 --> 01:29:15.119 align:start position:0%
school year we discovered that there was
 
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
an event that was unpermitted that was
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
allowed to go forward and that one event
 
01:29:21.070 --> 01:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
all by itself even though the event I
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
think it should have been allowed to go
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
forward it demonstrates that their
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
policy is not being done in an
 
01:29:28.669 --> 01:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
evenhanded manner there is other
 
01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
evidence as well in this database that
 
01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
strongly suggests Viewpoint
 
01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
discrimination especially against some
 
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
of the smaller conservative and
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
Christian groups and I think it's time
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
that we step in as a state as we have
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
been requested to by many
 
01:29:45.229 --> 01:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
students to establish a baseline level
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
of freedom of Association and freedom of
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
speech on college campuses that can be
 
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
administered without regard for the
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
views that are being expressed as long
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
as they don't violate
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
law and uh I would I would urge you to
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
support this thank
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you um a couple things I'd
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
like to point out one in in relation to
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
the database that the member just
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
brought up I think at the last hearing
 
01:30:18.990 --> 01:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
the uh College uh refuted a number of
 
01:30:23.310 --> 01:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
those instances that were raised uh um
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
um from uh looking at the database and
 
01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
and bringing in the context of the
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
situation um I think that this bill is
 
01:30:37.229 --> 01:30:37.239 align:start position:0%
um has been worked on since the bill
 
01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
last year and I think that the
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
primary um um concern of the community
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
college system and the university system
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
was in terms of the remedies and that
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
has been um addressed in this bill um uh
 
01:31:00.189 --> 01:31:00.199 align:start position:0%
with guard rails on the amount of
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
awards uh so I think that uh um that uh
 
01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
is a step forward and making this bill
 
01:31:11.950 --> 01:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
palatable to all further discussion
 
01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:13.149 align:start position:0%
palatable to all further discussion
representative

01:31:13.149 --> 01:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you Mr chairman I'm going be
 
01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
voting no on this uh we have we've dealt
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
with this in this committee several
 
01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.430 align:start position:0%
with this in this committee several
times

01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:31:26.669 --> 01:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
uh we have seen the uh National reigning
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
from fire uh dealing with free speech
 
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
fire is a group that basically looks at
 
01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
free speech on campus across the country
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
we have looked at uh their review of
 
01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
this thing this topic and the university
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
system has gone from you need
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
Improvement to ranking one or two in the
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
country I think the institutions have
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
done a a a good job
 
01:31:55.149 --> 01:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
in adjusting their system to make sure
 
01:31:58.990 --> 01:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
that there is in fact uh free speech on
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
campus and that this bill is not needed
 
01:32:04.990 --> 01:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
and it does not recognize what schools
 
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
what the colleges have done to try to
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
address this issue so I don't think this
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill is needed thank you further
 
01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
discussion representative what
 
01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
luno sure thank you very much Mr chair
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
so so while while we just heard um
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli suggests that
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is now palatable um it is
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
certainly not palatable to um to the
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
community college system it's not
 
01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
palatable to the uh the universities in
 
01:32:36.750 --> 01:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
the University system of New Hampshire
 
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
it's not palatable to me I'm certainly
 
01:32:40.990 --> 01:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
going to be voting voting against the
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and U and uh for example
 
01:32:48.750 --> 01:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I find not only
 
01:32:52.109 --> 01:32:52.119 align:start position:0%
unpalatable but um but but just
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
completely objectionable and
 
01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
discriminatory is um is the fact that um
 
01:32:59.870 --> 01:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
that under the in the freedom of
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
Association section in this bill that uh
 
01:33:07.109 --> 01:33:07.119 align:start position:0%
that the um that the bill would uh would
 
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
require the uh you know States colleges
 
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
and universities to support student
 
01:33:19.870 --> 01:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
organizations um or not deny support for
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
a student organization based on any
 
01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
religious political or IDE
 
01:33:29.709 --> 01:33:29.719 align:start position:0%
ideological um benefit and privilege uh
 
01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
incl and it would include the
 
01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:34.119 align:start position:0%
requirement that um that those
 
01:33:37.629 --> 01:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
organizations can uh can discriminate uh
 
01:33:41.310 --> 01:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
against uh against student members so so
 
01:33:43.109 --> 01:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
uh just the fact that you've got you've
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
got something here that's that's
 
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
blatantly discriminatory uh I I I think
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's unacceptable for New Hampshire
 
01:33:54.990 --> 01:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.109 --> 01:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
it represent
 
01:34:01.950 --> 01:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman L um I just
 
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
want to I I've read the
 
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
information heard the testimony I just
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on the I didn't hear
 
01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
what representative I may have
 
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
misunderstood what representative Bela
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
said but the the Attorney General in
 
01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
their statement to us all um indicated
 
01:34:17.709 --> 01:34:17.719 align:start position:0%
they weren't taking a position but they
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
had severe
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
reservations um if I may just read that
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
one line if it's okay with you Mr chair
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
yes um a concern arise with the fact
 
01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
that the proposed legislation does not
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
consider the application of all the
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
harassment laws yet the new definitional
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
harassment contained in the proposed
 
01:34:36.189 --> 01:34:36.199 align:start position:0%
legislation raises questions of whether
 
01:34:37.629 --> 01:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
campus police could enforce the state
 
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
criminal harassment laws on campus or
 
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
whether institutions of High Learning
 
01:34:42.750 --> 01:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
could sanction groups that may engage in
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
criminal harassment um so I don't I
 
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
don't read that as a as a host of
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
support from the Attorney General's
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
office uh on on the Bill and as as
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
representative luno indicated both the
 
01:34:58.109 --> 01:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
the fouryear institution the UNA and the
 
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
community col system both testified to
 
01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
be more difficult for them to give a
 
01:35:05.229 --> 01:35:05.239 align:start position:0%
fair open uh program and they have they
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
have already policies in place that
 
01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
allow this to happen in a regular basis
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
without much without much issue so I I
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
also will not be uh supporting this I
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
don't think it's in the best interest of
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
the community college system or the
 
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
students that go there thank you Mr
 
01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
chair you're welcome uh representative
 
01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
Donald thank you Mr chair I won't belor
 
01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
the issue too much further because I do
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
support this bill and I believe
 
01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher noted a lot of
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
the reasons why but some of the reasons
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
that were not covered is the fact that
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
this addresses the issue of a heckler's
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
veto which is when someone else acts
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
inappropriately at a student event and
 
01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
the organization is discriminated
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
against for no fault of their own as
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
well of the issue of free speech zones
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
where free speech is limited to specific
 
01:35:52.350 --> 01:35:52.360 align:start position:0%
zones on campus which could be the back
 
01:35:54.270 --> 01:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
corner of the parking lot practically
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
off campus but not allowed and
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
everywhere else I'd also like to mention
 
01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
since fire which is a foundation for
 
01:36:04.109 --> 01:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
individual rights and expression was
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned that they give the University
 
01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:08.360 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire a
 
01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
72% which that might be better than
 
01:36:10.719 --> 01:36:11.990 align:start position:0%
72% which that might be better than
other

01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
institutions but that's a c I wouldn't
 
01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
say that's a standard to say that the
 
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
school is doing as well as they could
 
01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
and not not to say that they're not
 
01:36:24.990 --> 01:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
trying but I think this bill is
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
necessary at this time for that reason
 
01:36:29.709 --> 01:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
especially so thank you further
 
01:36:31.470 --> 01:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
discussion represent
 
01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
leus yes I two comments one also based
 
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
on fire fire bases their ratings based
 
01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
on the school's policy not on how well
 
01:36:44.109 --> 01:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
the school um follows their policy I had
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
that discussion with them
 
01:36:46.199 --> 01:36:49.470 align:start position:0%
that discussion with them
earlier

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
um and the other part had to do with
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
freedom of Association if somebody tells
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
you who you have to associate with that
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
is not freedom of Association freedom of
 
01:37:02.669 --> 01:37:02.679 align:start position:0%
Association is when you get to choose
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
who you associate with and as an example
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
if the the young
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
Democrats young students for de the
 
01:37:14.590 --> 01:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
Democrat Party happen to be in the
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
minority on a college
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
campus and the Republicans decided they
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to come in and all join and come
 
01:37:24.990 --> 01:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
the head of the the UN the organization
 
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
and decide what way it's going to go I
 
01:37:29.950 --> 01:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
don't think that would be appropriate
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
and so that it would be the case I think
 
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
for any
 
01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:35.590 align:start position:0%
for any
small

01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
small
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
organization that did not necessarily
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
follow what the majority of that school
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
students followed they would not in
 
01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
effect basically be able to have an
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
organization because anybody could come
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
and and usurp it and so for those two
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
parts of free association I very much
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
support this Bill thank you further
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%

representative woodcock's concerns
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
because he was speaking to an email from
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
January 8th I believe um from director
 
01:38:15.709 --> 01:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
lock from the Attorney General's office
 
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%

they can't be denied um uh activity fees
 
01:40:07.709 --> 01:40:07.719 align:start position:0%
uh Etc so I think that this section of
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
the bill is um one of the most important
 
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
and we had heard testimony uh dating
 
01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
back to last year from associations that
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
had um a problem organizing on campuses
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
um in this
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
state represent luno thanks very much
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I just don't think um um families
 
01:40:32.709 --> 01:40:32.719 align:start position:0%
that pay uh pay tuition at uh UNH nor
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers who support um UNH the
 
01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
community colleges and the state
 
01:40:40.510 --> 01:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
universities should uh should
 
01:40:43.870 --> 01:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily be on the hook to uh to
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
provide uh meeting space as well as
 
01:40:49.470 --> 01:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
funding for extremist groups like
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
neo-nazis white SU
 
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
white supremacists anti-semitic
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
organizations and the like and uh those
 
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
groups are going to exist U but they
 
01:41:00.189 --> 01:41:00.199 align:start position:0%
don't need to exist as recognized
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
student groups at the cost to taxpayers
 
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
and families that pay tuition and so I'm
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
going to vote along with I think the
 
01:41:09.629 --> 01:41:09.639 align:start position:0%
vast majority of granite Staters which
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
find these groups to be horrific and
 
01:41:14.430 --> 01:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
should not be operating with uh with
 
01:41:17.589 --> 01:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayer or public money thank you
 
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
represent leus
 
01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
part of the whole point of freedom of
 
01:41:24.199 --> 01:41:25.750 align:start position:0%
part of the whole point of freedom of

01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
speech
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
is it's free for every person regardless
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
of their opinion and how obnoxious it is
 
01:41:36.589 --> 01:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
just because you think an opinion is
 
01:41:39.229 --> 01:41:39.239 align:start position:0%
obnoxious that other person should not
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
be kept from making it that's part of
 
01:41:45.310 --> 01:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
free speech we have to put up sometimes
 
01:41:48.270 --> 01:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
with things that we don't
 
01:41:52.350 --> 01:41:52.360 align:start position:0%

01:44:22.109 --> 01:44:22.119 align:start position:0%
motion Mr chairman I move that this bill
 
01:44:22.119 --> 01:44:23.589 align:start position:0%
motion Mr chairman I move that this bill
be

01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
ital is there a
 
01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
second second repr Le is
 
01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
seconds so we have a motion on the table
 
01:44:36.990 --> 01:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
on before us it's HB 1311 is itl made by
 
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
represent cordello and second by
 
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
represent leus represent cordello do you
 
01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
have anything to say on it yes Mr chair
 
01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
um so this bill has to do with
 
01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
collection development
 
01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.790 --> 01:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
and my main problem with this bill is
 
01:44:59.790 --> 01:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
the criteria
 
01:45:03.310 --> 01:45:03.320 align:start position:0%
predominantly puts forth for those
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
policies and we've all heard obviously
 
01:45:10.669 --> 01:45:10.679 align:start position:0%
don't judge a book by its
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
cover well I feel like what this bill
 
01:45:18.589 --> 01:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
does is is worse than that it it judges
 
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
books by the identity of the author or
 
01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:23.870 align:start position:0%
books by the identity of the author or
the

01:45:23.870 --> 01:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
characters and um so this is what I take
 
01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:28.719 align:start position:0%
issue with and I I was thinking about
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
this last night sort of I always try to
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
come up with sort of concrete example
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
and uh in this list one of the
 
01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
categories is uh just to make my example
 
01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
um physical disability um imagine if you
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
would some book that was written by a
 
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
blind person and the entire book was
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
just a riously obscene and just a book
 
01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
that anyone would just completely think
 
01:45:58.669 --> 01:45:58.679 align:start position:0%
would not be suitable in a library
 
01:46:02.229 --> 01:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
um a parent would not be able to bring
 
01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
this book forth as one to
 
01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
be uh reconsidered because you could
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
pull up this identity of the author and
 
01:46:13.589 --> 01:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
therefore you know the the it's not so
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
much that you would judge the content of
 
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
the book but the person who wrote it or
 
01:46:21.149 --> 01:46:21.159 align:start position:0%
the characters in it so
 
01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
um I'll let other people talk I just
 
01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring up this is my main
 
01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
problem with the bill uh and of course
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
words of Martin Luther King were going
 
01:46:30.830 --> 01:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
through my head and as I say this last
 
01:46:32.910 --> 01:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
Point you'll see I'm paraphrasing him a
 
01:46:37.229 --> 01:46:37.239 align:start position:0%
bit that books and Library material
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
should not be judged by the identity of
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
their author or the characters but by
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
the content of their pages I know that
 
01:46:46.109 --> 01:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
this bill was mentioned several times
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
last week as some sort of solution to
 
01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
this problem uh when we were you know
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
1419 and I don't see this as a a
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
solution at all to uh this problem of
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
materials and and what books should be
 
01:47:03.589 --> 01:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
put into our
 
01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
libraries thank you m thank you very
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
much further discussion representative
 
01:47:12.189 --> 01:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you um yes it it was
 
01:47:15.229 --> 01:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh with the last bill that we
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
had and this this bill offers um I
 
01:47:21.589 --> 01:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
believe a way to
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
keep local control uh Community
 
01:47:28.109 --> 01:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
standards of local areas and put things
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
in context what we heard last
 
01:47:35.229 --> 01:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
week in rep's Hall was not in
 
01:47:38.830 --> 01:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
context and um I think this is a wellth
 
01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
thought out bill it it sets up a a
 
01:47:45.310 --> 01:47:45.320 align:start position:0%
procedure a policy procedure uh it sets
 
01:47:48.669 --> 01:47:48.679 align:start position:0%
up um people representative from the
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
community and the school uh to review
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
materials in the total context of the
 
01:47:57.149 --> 01:47:57.159 align:start position:0%
material rather than pull out one or two
 
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
paragraphs um obviously no one wants
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
obscene material uh but obscene material
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
has to be defined and this policy gives
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
a PO a way for the community to be
 
01:48:16.270 --> 01:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:18.189 --> 01:48:18.199 align:start position:0%
materials further discussion
 
01:48:18.199 --> 01:48:19.229 align:start position:0%
materials further discussion
representative

01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:48:22.709 --> 01:48:22.719 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair
 
01:48:25.470 --> 01:48:25.480 align:start position:0%
so to me this bill takes the concept of
 
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination and totally flips it
 
01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:29.560 align:start position:0%
upside down children have the right to
 
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
be free from abuse yet instead of
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
seeking to protect children from injury
 
01:48:38.109 --> 01:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
inflicted by age inappropriate content
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
this bill would actually seek to protect
 
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
the author of the content who is likely
 
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
not even a resident of this state from
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
having their book removed based on their
 
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
identity in other words there's no limit
 
01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
to the obscenely harmful nature of a
 
01:48:54.910 --> 01:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
book given to minors if the author
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
happens to claim a certain protected
 
01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
identity if we use this logic
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
universally a handgun could be handed to
 
01:49:04.589 --> 01:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
a child if it were assembled by a
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
pansexual furry and we could not demand
 
01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
it be removed for fear of discrimination
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
against the
 
01:49:13.709 --> 01:49:13.719 align:start position:0%
assembler the expenditure of public
 
01:49:16.669 --> 01:49:16.679 align:start position:0%
funds to on literature particularly for
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
minors must not be predicated on the
 
01:49:22.629 --> 01:49:22.639 align:start position:0%
identity visions of the author it must
 
01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
be predicated on the appropriateness of
 
01:49:27.950 --> 01:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
the content for the book with no regard
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
for the identity status of anyone
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
involved because that itself would be
 
01:49:36.030 --> 01:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
discriminatory thank you further
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:44.470 --> 01:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
Miler another aspect of this such policy
 
01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
shall further State the material shall
 
01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
not be prescribed on the basis of
 
01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:51.070 align:start position:0%
not be prescribed on the basis of
viewpoint

01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
viewpoint
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
and if the Viewpoint is that children
 
01:49:58.030 --> 01:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
should be sexual objects for
 
01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
adults we would not be able to
 
01:50:02.189 --> 01:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
discriminate we would not be able to
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
remove that because that's a
 
01:50:08.109 --> 01:50:08.119 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint and I think that can be very
 
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
dangerous represent
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you Mr
 
01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
chair I'm disappointed in this it motion
 
01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:17.750 align:start position:0%
chair I'm disappointed in this it motion
um

01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
frankly um based upon uh the scene that
 
01:50:24.430 --> 01:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
was in the uh chamber last week I was
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
hoping that this would provide an
 
01:50:31.470 --> 01:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity for uh common sense to begin
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
to look at policies that govern what's
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
in libraries this is the bipartisan bill
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's being presented to us it is uh
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
been vetted uh through the library
 
01:50:47.870 --> 01:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
Librarians Etc and um I think this is a
 
01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:50.719 align:start position:0%
common sense approach uh to looking at
 
01:50:53.790 --> 01:50:53.800 align:start position:0%
standards that are local uh to deal with
 
01:50:56.310 --> 01:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
issues uh and I'm again I'm just I'm
 
01:50:58.390 --> 01:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
disappointed that we can't as a
 
01:51:02.430 --> 01:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
committee come together in trying to far
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
it out exactly how we can begin to look
 
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
at uh literature Etc that has a kind of
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
a a community standard that's created by
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
the committee that's it's recommended
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
here so I'm I'm I'm sorry I just just
 
01:51:18.069 --> 01:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
I'm just disappointed that we can't come
 
01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
to some conclusion on this thank you Mr
 
01:51:25.589 --> 01:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
chair represent cordelli um thank you um
 
01:51:29.189 --> 01:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
just in talking about context and so
 
01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
forth um last week the um uh situation
 
01:51:37.950 --> 01:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
that was just described uh um on the
 
01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:43.239 align:start position:0%
house floor um uh complete um materials
 
01:51:46.189 --> 01:51:46.199 align:start position:0%
could have been read not just excerpts
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
but um some didn't want us to even hear
 
01:51:50.669 --> 01:51:50.679 align:start position:0%
the excerpt
 
01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
let alone the full material that is
 
01:51:57.189 --> 01:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
present in um schools including middle
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
schools and uh I'm not sure about
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
elementary schools um in this state um I
 
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
don't think that this bill um
 
01:52:11.229 --> 01:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
advances um what we have heard we don't
 
01:52:13.069 --> 01:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
want obscene materials being made
 
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:15.800 align:start position:0%
available um to students I don't think
 
01:52:17.709 --> 01:52:17.719 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:22.679 align:start position:0%
uh advances that cost or that goal um in
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
that as we've heard um an author's um
 
01:52:32.109 --> 01:52:32.119 align:start position:0%
age sex uh sexual orientation um uh is
 
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
involved but I'd also point out that
 
01:52:37.629 --> 01:52:37.639 align:start position:0%
this is not just books this is
 
01:52:40.109 --> 01:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
applications interactive applications in
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
software by definition and we have had
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
testimony about these interactive
 
01:52:49.109 --> 01:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
applications some of which provide links
 
01:52:52.030 --> 01:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:54.109 --> 01:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
possibly middle school students to
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
communicate with some of these authors
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
um who are talking about um
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
um applications that match up um
 
01:53:10.109 --> 01:53:10.119 align:start position:0%
individuals uh for the purpose of sex um
 
01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think that that um is something
 
01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
we want in our schools uh but this would
 
01:53:19.950 --> 01:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
seem to say no you have to allow that
 
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
otherwise it would be
 
01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination so uh I think that this
 
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
um in some ways is um uh dangerous
 
01:53:33.189 --> 01:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
legislation further discussion
 
01:53:33.199 --> 01:53:34.310 align:start position:0%
legislation further discussion
representative

01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%

01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
to representative Cordelia using this
 
01:53:47.069 --> 01:53:47.079 align:start position:0%
bill is any way to gu a support for that
 
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
obnoxious andar Place presentation on
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
the floor I would was responding to if I
 
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
just speaking please thank you um
 
01:53:56.430 --> 01:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
there's no way this comes close to that
 
01:54:00.510 --> 01:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
activity that being said uh represent
 
01:54:04.030 --> 01:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
lad uh at the hearing uh we had received
 
01:54:07.149 --> 01:54:07.159 align:start position:0%
the technical advisory from uh the
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh dated May 12
 
01:54:12.270 --> 01:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
2023 at that hearing I asked if you
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
would you Rec you request from them uh
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
the preview the
 
01:54:20.069 --> 01:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
2017 uh technical advisory the pre seed
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
this one and I don't we haven't received
 
01:54:23.830 --> 01:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
that yet and I don't know if if you
 
01:54:25.069 --> 01:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
happen to have a chance to do that or
 
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
you put it in or they didn't do it or
 
01:54:29.310 --> 01:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
there was one here and disappeared we
 
01:54:31.390 --> 01:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
did get a report back from them and that
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
was a temporary technical advisory as
 
01:54:38.189 --> 01:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
you recall that it was quickly changed
 
01:54:40.189 --> 01:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
if if we're on the same page here that
 
01:54:41.589 --> 01:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
was different bill that's another bill
 
01:54:42.990 --> 01:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
that's another bill that was dealing
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
rules2 people question because it came
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
all very quickly out it was 2017 the
 
01:54:57.870 --> 01:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
fa got that no okay um thank you I would
 
01:54:57.880 --> 01:54:59.229 align:start position:0%
fa got that no okay um thank you I would
recall

01:54:59.229 --> 01:54:59.239 align:start position:0%
recall
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:07.589 --> 01:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
so but the thing
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
that can't out my mind when R speaking
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
he that students have the right to see
 
01:55:18.270 --> 01:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
themselves in live
 
01:55:21.149 --> 01:55:21.159 align:start position:0%
reading uh all this bill does is start
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
the first step for local school boards
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
to start processing so everybody has
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
policiy uh that govern media collections
 
01:55:31.709 --> 01:55:31.719 align:start position:0%
which is I think something we all want
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
no one wants as representative T just
 
01:55:36.069 --> 01:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
said no one wants to see a SE material
 
01:55:38.189 --> 01:55:38.199 align:start position:0%
in the school we want to see something
 
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
this is this is the perfect bypass
 
01:55:41.589 --> 01:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to start that process to
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
have school board do that I
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
think I I've got a question has anybody
 
01:55:51.310 --> 01:55:51.320 align:start position:0%
on the committee seen a boiler plate
 
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
policy that's been put together by the
 
01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school boards Association
 
01:55:58.510 --> 01:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
relative to how uh books in library may
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
be reconsidered where they stay on the
 
01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
shelves or they're taken off the shelves
 
01:56:04.189 --> 01:56:04.199 align:start position:0%
within a certain period of the the
 
01:56:08.270 --> 01:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
request um is there such a policy out
 
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
there representative
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
cascaden if I may yes to your
 
01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:17.320 align:start position:0%
question but may I speak yes yes okay
 
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
yes um this bill actually
 
01:56:24.990 --> 01:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
um provides more local control and don't
 
01:56:27.390 --> 01:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
you want less government intervention it
 
01:56:29.069 --> 01:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
also complements the policy of
 
01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
collection development policies for
 
01:56:33.709 --> 01:56:33.719 align:start position:0%
school library media centers for
 
01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:35.679 align:start position:0%
essential curriculum development
 
01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
procedures for selection of materials
 
01:56:41.229 --> 01:56:41.239 align:start position:0%
selection criteria for SEL uh for
 
01:56:43.390 --> 01:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
selection selection of
 
01:56:46.510 --> 01:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
non-print materials selection of print
 
01:56:49.149 --> 01:56:49.159 align:start position:0%
materials procedures to be followed for
 
01:56:49.159 --> 01:56:50.669 align:start position:0%
materials procedures to be followed for
chall

01:56:50.669 --> 01:56:50.679 align:start position:0%
chall
 
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
materials I think that when it gets down
 
01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
to the nitty-gritty of determining
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
appropriateness it's time for a parent
 
01:56:59.830 --> 01:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
to take responsibility for
 
01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
that um links that are available to
 
01:57:07.390 --> 01:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
sex can be attained through the home
 
01:57:09.790 --> 01:57:09.800 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say so in in
 
01:57:13.149 --> 01:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
response to my question yes were those
 
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
technical advisories or boilerplate
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
policies issued by the school boards
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
Association are actually School Board
 
01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
adopted policies that were modeled after
 
01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
the sample School Board Association
 
01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
policies thank you Mr chair if I may
 
01:57:31.069 --> 01:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
representer when when U Mr Christina was
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
in in his
 
01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
testimony uh during the uh 129 hearing
 
01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
he did indicate that they do have those
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
policies and there is a recodification
 
01:57:44.830 --> 01:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
process that they use so to answer I
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
think to answer your qu I don't those
 
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
policies haven't been presented to the
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
committee uh but the representative of
 
01:57:53.709 --> 01:57:53.719 align:start position:0%
the school boards Association was clear
 
01:57:56.069 --> 01:57:56.079 align:start position:0%
that they do have policies that try to
 
01:57:58.350 --> 01:57:58.360 align:start position:0%
address this issue and this bill would
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
basically complement those
 
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
policies then my followup question was
 
01:58:05.189 --> 01:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
why do we need this bill if we have
 
01:58:09.229 --> 01:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
policies already out there correct they
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
fall under the K section if you look at
 
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
any public school district that has
 
01:58:16.669 --> 01:58:16.679 align:start position:0%
their online policies they are in the K
 
01:58:18.149 --> 01:58:18.159 align:start position:0%
section so
 
01:58:20.149 --> 01:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
KC's um
 
01:58:26.430 --> 01:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.510 --> 01:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
procedures represent leus do you have
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
01:58:34.030 --> 01:58:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
you the part of this that says for those
 
01:58:40.510 --> 01:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
schools who might not have a policy that
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
they need to have a policy and what that
 
01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
PO you know and what that policy needs
 
01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
to cover Etc that's great and if this
 
01:58:52.149 --> 01:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
just did that that would be great the
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
problem is it has these exceptions and
 
01:58:57.189 --> 01:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
for me the Viewpoint
 
01:59:00.510 --> 01:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
exception is a killer because there are
 
01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
people who believe that pedophilia is a
 
01:59:07.870 --> 01:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
good thing and I don't want books to
 
01:59:11.870 --> 01:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
be um pushing that and not be able to be
 
01:59:13.790 --> 01:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
disallowed because that's a
 
01:59:16.750 --> 01:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint and so to me that's the killer
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
if you just said every school has to
 
01:59:22.270 --> 01:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
have a policy the policy has to cover
 
01:59:24.990 --> 01:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
these things I'm all for that I think
 
01:59:26.589 --> 01:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
that would be good that's what I was
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
hoping this bill was and then when I saw
 
01:59:30.669 --> 01:59:30.679 align:start position:0%
the exceptions I'm like why did they
 
01:59:33.109 --> 01:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
have to poison the bill why couldn't
 
01:59:35.629 --> 01:59:35.639 align:start position:0%
they just leave it as come up with a
 
01:59:38.910 --> 01:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
policy thank you further discussion on
 
01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald thank you Mr chair
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like to bring it back to something
 
01:59:45.229 --> 01:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock mentioned and
 
01:59:47.629 --> 01:59:47.639 align:start position:0%
I'm glad he mentioned the fact that the
 
01:59:50.069 --> 01:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor stated the right to
 
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
representation CU that's something that
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
stood out to me during the hearing as
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
well right to representation in school
 
01:59:57.910 --> 01:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
libraries and I pressed the prime
 
01:59:59.870 --> 01:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor a little bit too and he added
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
right to see all different types of
 
02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
people found in New Hampshire in school
 
02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
libraries all different types and if we
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
believe that every person is different
 
02:00:12.589 --> 02:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
and unique that's about 1.4 million
 
02:00:14.830 --> 02:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
people in the state of New Hampshire and
 
02:00:17.229 --> 02:00:17.239 align:start position:0%
does that mean that we should have 1.4
 
02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
million books at least in each School
 
02:00:23.550 --> 02:00:23.560 align:start position:0%
library and to build accommodating
 
02:00:26.430 --> 02:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
spaces to house these books and if that
 
02:00:28.750 --> 02:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
is a stated intent of this bill then why
 
02:00:30.870 --> 02:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
is there not a fiscal note attached to
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
this and couldn't you even see that as
 
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
an unfunded mandate I just have a lot of
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
questions with this bill so I cannot
 
02:00:38.669 --> 02:00:38.679 align:start position:0%
support it thank you further discussion
 
02:00:41.189 --> 02:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
on on the bill yes representative per
 
02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
yes I have a concern with um line 16
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
where um it states that we a policy will
 
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
be be established um by which parents
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
and permanent Guardians May submit a
 
02:00:54.830 --> 02:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
request for consideration to the school
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent and principal and we're
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
talking about um establishing Community
 
02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
standards but this process stops with
 
02:01:04.470 --> 02:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
the superintendent or the principal and
 
02:01:06.830 --> 02:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't even get it to the school board
 
02:01:08.750 --> 02:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
where it would see the light of day and
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
a true Community standard could be
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
established further
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%

02:05:00.430 --> 02:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
who do we have for that one I'm not
 
02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:03.520 align:start position:0%

we're going on this bill

02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
representative pel you recommended or
 
02:05:15.390 --> 02:05:15.400 align:start position:0%

02:05:17.390 --> 02:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on House Bill
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
1594 is there

02:05:24.589 --> 02:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
representative Pell's motion of itl on
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
1594 representative Pell yes thank you
 
02:05:31.109 --> 02:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um this bill would require
 
02:05:33.549 --> 02:05:33.559 align:start position:0%
means testing for Education Freedom
 
02:05:35.709 --> 02:05:35.719 align:start position:0%
account recipients in years subsequent
 
02:05:38.430 --> 02:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
to the initial qualifying period And if
 
02:05:40.709 --> 02:05:40.719 align:start position:0%
a family no longer qualifies a student
 
02:05:42.350 --> 02:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
might be forced to return to an
 
02:05:44.229 --> 02:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
educational system that was not meeting
 
02:05:46.470 --> 02:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
their needs the purpose of the
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
educational Freedom account program is
 
02:05:50.030 --> 02:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
to to encourage parents to seek
 
02:05:52.229 --> 02:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities that maximize
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
their child's potential this bill would
 
02:05:57.310 --> 02:05:57.320 align:start position:0%
disincentivize parents from advancing in
 
02:05:59.069 --> 02:05:59.079 align:start position:0%
their occupations or income level
 
02:06:01.629 --> 02:06:01.639 align:start position:0%
because a modest wage increase of $1 per
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
hour could eliminate their child from
 
02:06:06.430 --> 02:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
the program knowing that such a slight
 
02:06:08.229 --> 02:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
increase would prohibit future funding
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
could be a discouraging to access to
 
02:06:13.310 --> 02:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
accessing the successful program
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts are currently
 
02:06:18.109 --> 02:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
be being utilized by 3% of qualifying
 
02:06:20.030 --> 02:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
students demonstrating
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
slow controlled growth it would be
 
02:06:25.270 --> 02:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
unfair to eliminate funding for students
 
02:06:28.669 --> 02:06:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
setting further
 
02:06:34.350 --> 02:06:34.360 align:start position:0%
discussion represent
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
Miler well I put for thank you Mr chair
 
02:06:39.149 --> 02:06:39.159 align:start position:0%
I put for this
 
02:06:41.790 --> 02:06:41.800 align:start position:0%
bill and I provided to the
 
02:06:45.149 --> 02:06:45.159 align:start position:0%
committee uh and an analysis of those
 
02:06:48.189 --> 02:06:48.199 align:start position:0%
bills that have poverty related issues
 
02:06:50.830 --> 02:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
within our stfe budget this is the only
 
02:06:52.629 --> 02:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
B bill that this is the only program
 
02:06:55.030 --> 02:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have that kind of uh uh
 
02:06:58.030 --> 02:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
recertification every year uh and it
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
just only seems fair to me that you know
 
02:07:04.030 --> 02:07:04.040 align:start position:0%
we're not dealing with uh a small budget
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
here we're dealing with millions of
 
02:07:08.549 --> 02:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
dollars and it only seems right from a
 
02:07:10.270 --> 02:07:10.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayer standpoint that have some sense
 
02:07:12.510 --> 02:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
of recertification of what who should
 
02:07:14.189 --> 02:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
qualify notwithstanding what
 
02:07:16.109 --> 02:07:16.119 align:start position:0%
representing pattern El I understand
 
02:07:19.350 --> 02:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
that but the point is is that if uh at
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
this point in time if a person starts in
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
the program and they're making uh
 
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
$440,000 a year and over five or six
 
02:07:30.669 --> 02:07:30.679 align:start position:0%
years they're now up beyond that that
 
02:07:33.430 --> 02:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
350% it only seems right to me from a
 
02:07:35.229 --> 02:07:35.239 align:start position:0%
from a taxpayer standpoint that there
 
02:07:37.589 --> 02:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
ought to be some accountability of who
 
02:07:40.229 --> 02:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
qualifies here this should not be an
 
02:07:43.149 --> 02:07:43.159 align:start position:0%
open-ended system here there ought to be
 
02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
some sense of guide guard rails now we
 
02:07:48.510 --> 02:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
have advanced several guard rails here
 
02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
you're going to see one in just a minute
 
02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
to provide some sense of accountability
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
of this particular program and I frankly
 
02:07:58.709 --> 02:07:58.719 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised at the for those who are
 
02:08:00.350 --> 02:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
concerned about how we spend money in
 
02:08:02.470 --> 02:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
this state that there's not some more
 
02:08:04.229 --> 02:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
recognition of the need to have some
 
02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
kind of guard RS at some point in time
 
02:08:08.510 --> 02:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to be there and this is
 
02:08:11.430 --> 02:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
just a I believe it's a common sense
 
02:08:13.549 --> 02:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
approach to saying you know if you've
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
got just like you have snap just like
 
02:08:18.549 --> 02:08:18.559 align:start position:0%
you have other poverty programs that
 
02:08:20.270 --> 02:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
there ought to be a recertification here
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's to me it's a it's a simple analysis
 
02:08:24.549 --> 02:08:24.559 align:start position:0%
of what we need to provide some sense of
 
02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
guard rails for this particular
 
02:08:29.709 --> 02:08:29.719 align:start position:0%
program thank you further discussion
 
02:08:29.719 --> 02:08:31.910 align:start position:0%
program thank you further discussion
representa

02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
representa
 
02:08:34.109 --> 02:08:34.119 align:start position:0%
leus first off we're talking about
 
02:08:35.950 --> 02:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
education and we're talking about the
 
02:08:37.790 --> 02:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
money that's provided by the state to
 
02:08:40.589 --> 02:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
educate the kids in the state which is a
 
02:08:45.310 --> 02:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
different thing um if you have money for
 
02:08:47.910 --> 02:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
food coming from the state and then you
 
02:08:51.709 --> 02:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
have enough money you provide food for
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
your family but you can't keep providing
 
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily the education that your kid
 
02:09:00.629 --> 02:09:00.639 align:start position:0%
is at so if your your um income pops
 
02:09:03.470 --> 02:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
around which some people do then you're
 
02:09:06.549 --> 02:09:06.559 align:start position:0%
jerking the kid around okay you can be
 
02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
in you can go to the school that's
 
02:09:09.629 --> 02:09:09.639 align:start position:0%
working for you okay this year now you
 
02:09:11.470 --> 02:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
can't you got to go back to the public
 
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
school that wasn't working for you where
 
02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
you were being bullied and you weren't
 
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
getting the services you needed oh but
 
02:09:18.030 --> 02:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
this year you can go back and that is
 
02:09:20.669 --> 02:09:20.679 align:start position:0%
not not fair to the kids and it's the
 
02:09:22.350 --> 02:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
kids and the education of the kids we're
 
02:09:24.750 --> 02:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
talking about here and that's why that
 
02:09:28.109 --> 02:09:28.119 align:start position:0%
was put in to begin with was to make
 
02:09:31.109 --> 02:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
sure kids weren't being messed around
 
02:09:33.390 --> 02:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
and shuffled from school to school so
 
02:09:36.109 --> 02:09:36.119 align:start position:0%
they had some stability thank you thank
 
02:09:38.189 --> 02:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
you very much further discussion
 
02:09:39.470 --> 02:09:39.480 align:start position:0%

02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:43.030 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock and then
representative

02:09:43.030 --> 02:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.069 --> 02:09:47.079 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you represent Hall thank you
 
02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
um first of all this program is an
 
02:09:52.030 --> 02:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
eligibility cap program it's not
 
02:09:54.350 --> 02:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
Universal it was voted down it's
 
02:09:57.350 --> 02:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
eligibility and the idea that these kids
 
02:09:58.709 --> 02:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
are going to be jerked around and
 
02:10:00.270 --> 02:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to be sent back to public
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
school clearly these kids were in
 
02:10:04.109 --> 02:10:04.119 align:start position:0%
private school to start with the
 
02:10:06.270 --> 02:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
majority of them so to suggest that
 
02:10:07.589 --> 02:10:07.599 align:start position:0%
they're going to all of a sudden all go
 
02:10:09.790 --> 02:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
back to public school forced back to
 
02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
public school I think is a total fallacy
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome represent
 
02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
belshire thank you Mr chair I just want
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
to look at the cost of this and how
 
02:10:20.830 --> 02:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the cost of this bill
 
02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
for a moment because as of right now an
 
02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
educational student educational Freedom
 
02:10:27.229 --> 02:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
account student receives 4500 a year
 
02:10:29.589 --> 02:10:29.599 align:start position:0%
which is roughly a quarter of the
 
02:10:31.189 --> 02:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
average cost of sending a child to
 
02:10:33.390 --> 02:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
public school now a parent is much more
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
likely to receive a modest income
 
02:10:36.990 --> 02:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
increase than a significant income
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
increase what that means is there is a
 
02:10:41.350 --> 02:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
really good chance that the net effect
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
of this bill is more students going back
 
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
to public school and increased cost to
 
02:10:48.270 --> 02:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer as they move from freedom
 
02:10:50.350 --> 02:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
accounts back to their Public School
 
02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
meaning this bill at the end of the day
 
02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
is punitive to both students and the
 
02:10:58.390 --> 02:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayer thank you further discussion
 
02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:05.109 --> 02:11:05.119 align:start position:0%
committee yeah not not not to belor this
 
02:11:07.750 --> 02:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
conversation but 87% of the kids are
 
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
already in private schools when they get
 
02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:10.589 align:start position:0%
already in private schools when they get
their

02:11:10.589 --> 02:11:10.599 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:11:13.629 --> 02:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
vouchers the number of whatever the term
 
02:11:16.629 --> 02:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
is of those who the switchers who go
 
02:11:19.470 --> 02:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
from public schools to private schools
 
02:11:22.149 --> 02:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
is marginal so to think that they're
 
02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
going to go back to Public Schools when
 
02:11:27.229 --> 02:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
they're already in it and receiving the
 
02:11:31.069 --> 02:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
voucher to me it's a full hearty
 
02:11:34.669 --> 02:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
argument any further represent
 
02:11:37.510 --> 02:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
leus in the very first weeks of the
 
02:11:41.390 --> 02:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
program the numbers were small for
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
switchers by the time the program was
 
02:11:46.549 --> 02:11:46.559 align:start position:0%
really up and running by like November
 
02:11:49.310 --> 02:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
it was 45%
 
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
45% I'm not sure what it is right now
 
02:11:56.709 --> 02:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
but that was even already considering
 
02:11:59.830 --> 02:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
that a number of those kids had gone to
 
02:12:01.750 --> 02:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
public school they just hadn't gone to
 
02:12:03.709 --> 02:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
public school the year before well what
 
02:12:06.149 --> 02:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
was the year before it was covid a lot
 
02:12:08.510 --> 02:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
of public schools were closed kids had
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
already switched to private schools just
 
02:12:12.430 --> 02:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
so they could go to school and private
 
02:12:15.229 --> 02:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
schools had discounts for them so they
 
02:12:17.549 --> 02:12:17.559 align:start position:0%
could afford that discount they couldn't
 
02:12:19.870 --> 02:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily afford the full
 
02:12:22.669 --> 02:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
amount but they were in public school
 
02:12:25.390 --> 02:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
before that but the switchers counts
 
02:12:28.229 --> 02:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
just those coming immediately not those
 
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
who were already in public school and
 
02:12:34.589 --> 02:12:34.599 align:start position:0%
switched for covid so the timing of this
 
02:12:36.189 --> 02:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
makes all of those
 
02:12:39.669 --> 02:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
statistics messed up thank
 
02:12:44.589 --> 02:12:44.599 align:start position:0%
you representative pel yes thank you um
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
two points first of
 
02:12:50.069 --> 02:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
all if these children were already in
 
02:12:53.390 --> 02:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
private schools and they're um accessing
 
02:12:55.390 --> 02:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom Accounts at the
 
02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:57.109 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom Accounts at the
350%

02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
350%
 
02:12:59.870 --> 02:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
rate those families are sacrificing and
 
02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
struggling already significantly we are
 
02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
helping those families out that to and
 
02:13:07.149 --> 02:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
to that point we like to talk about
 
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
feeding these kids and this has been
 
02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
compared to snap and tanif programs and
 
02:13:14.750 --> 02:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
the the um sunset provision if your
 
02:13:17.629 --> 02:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
income rises above the qualifications
 
02:13:21.870 --> 02:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
for the those um for those programs
 
02:13:24.069 --> 02:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
however if we want to talk about feeding
 
02:13:27.430 --> 02:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
kids maybe the education Freedom account
 
02:13:29.350 --> 02:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
program is what makes the difference in
 
02:13:30.990 --> 02:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
a family being able to feed their

thank you Mr chairman
 
02:16:52.349 --> 02:16:52.359 align:start position:0%
um this um Bill takes a little different
 
02:16:54.190 --> 02:16:54.200 align:start position:0%
approach we we know we have an income
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
cap on the uh education Freedom account
 
02:17:00.750 --> 02:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
bill this puts a budget cap on the total
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
program um it limits the number of
 
02:17:07.030 --> 02:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
students um who can participate in the
 
02:17:09.990 --> 02:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
program even if they uh meet the family
 
02:17:12.389 --> 02:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
income cap um
 
02:17:16.030 --> 02:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
requirement um what happens to those
 
02:17:18.950 --> 02:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
students um they are
 
02:17:22.309 --> 02:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
trapped in a education environment that
 
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
is not meeting their
 
02:17:29.230 --> 02:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
needs um that is not the goal of this
 
02:17:31.709 --> 02:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
program and I don't think of Education
 
02:17:36.549 --> 02:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
in general um and that uh I think uh
 
02:17:39.309 --> 02:17:39.319 align:start position:0%
public education is about educating the
 
02:17:41.910 --> 02:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
public and uh that's what our focus
 
02:17:44.309 --> 02:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
should be making sure that every every
 
02:17:47.950 --> 02:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
child has the ability to uh get get the
 
02:17:51.070 --> 02:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
education that meets their uh individual
 
02:17:54.750 --> 02:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
needs um uh I can remember hearing ads
 
02:17:58.349 --> 02:17:58.359 align:start position:0%
on the radio from uh Nea about each
 
02:18:00.750 --> 02:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
child is unique and learns
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
differently um I believe that uh I agree
 
02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
with Nea on that point and I don't think
 
02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
that capping this program based on an
 
02:18:15.629 --> 02:18:15.639 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number when is the way we want
 
02:18:18.830 --> 02:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
to go especially when the education uh
 
02:18:23.429 --> 02:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
trust fund is set up so that um if funds
 
02:18:25.709 --> 02:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
are needed there's automatically a
 
02:18:28.309 --> 02:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
warrant drawn for more funds from from
 
02:18:31.509 --> 02:18:31.519 align:start position:0%
the general fund um and as we heard in
 
02:18:33.309 --> 02:18:33.319 align:start position:0%
the last bill I think from
 
02:18:35.629 --> 02:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
representative petel it's something like
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
3% of the eligible uh children um in the
 
02:18:42.429 --> 02:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
state are taking advantage of this so to
 
02:18:45.669 --> 02:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
think that there is um some year down
 
02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
the road where there's going to be a a
 
02:18:50.589 --> 02:18:50.599 align:start position:0%
mass Exodus of students from the public
 
02:18:53.589 --> 02:18:53.599 align:start position:0%
school system um well it's not going to
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
be from the EFA program but it's going
 
02:18:57.270 --> 02:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
to be because of the as we've seen over
 
02:18:59.389 --> 02:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
the past two decades and we'll continue
 
02:19:01.469 --> 02:19:01.479 align:start position:0%
continue to see for the next decade the
 
02:19:04.030 --> 02:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
mass Exodus is due to
 
02:19:07.870 --> 02:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
demographics um so I think that capping
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
this program to a arbitrary budgeted
 
02:19:18.349 --> 02:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
amount um is really uh impacting uh not
 
02:19:22.270 --> 02:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
our only our children's uh education but
 
02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
um our future as well because we know
 
02:19:26.709 --> 02:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
children are our
 
02:19:31.750 --> 02:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:34.910 --> 02:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
leus I don't believe the C that we cap
 
02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:35.790 align:start position:0%
leus I don't believe the C that we cap
the

02:19:35.790 --> 02:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:39.190 --> 02:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
amount that Charter Public School Kids
 
02:19:42.830 --> 02:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
how much how many kids can go to those
 
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
and that is an
 
02:19:48.110 --> 02:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
alternative educational program program
 
02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
that the state
 
02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
provides for different learning styles
 
02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
Etc and this is just
 
02:19:59.070 --> 02:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
another different alternative
 
02:20:01.630 --> 02:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity for kids with
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
different learning styles and I don't
 
02:20:06.190 --> 02:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
think we should cap it
 
02:20:09.910 --> 02:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
either I got a question for anybody on
 
02:20:11.710 --> 02:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
the committee here I'm I'm looking at
 
02:20:14.270 --> 02:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
this expense of $19.8 million per year
 
02:20:16.469 --> 02:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
of the banum but in fact we're
 
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
allocating for that bium $ 39.6
 
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
million with the wording here could we
 
02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
spend in the first year of the banum $25
 
02:20:30.309 --> 02:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
million or would we have to stick to the
 
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
million this is a question that as a
 
02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
matter of interpretation is brought up
 
02:20:42.030 --> 02:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note that we should be
 
02:20:44.990 --> 02:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:48.510 --> 02:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
of represent miler all right thank you
 
02:20:53.510 --> 02:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair let me try to to be reasonable
 
02:20:56.670 --> 02:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
again I mean I mean seriously I mean
 
02:20:58.870 --> 02:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
this is this is a this is a new
 
02:21:01.510 --> 02:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
program it's been in in place about
 
02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
three years each year it's gone over
 
02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:05.550 align:start position:0%
three years each year it's gone over
budget

02:21:05.550 --> 02:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
right well from from a fiscal
 
02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:09.590 align:start position:0%
right well from from a fiscal
conservative

02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
conservative
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint I would appeal to those of
 
02:21:13.870 --> 02:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
you that are fiscally
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
conservative to at least recognize that
 
02:21:19.590 --> 02:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
there are some limits now let's say you
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
go over the budget no problem no problem
 
02:21:25.469 --> 02:21:25.479 align:start position:0%
here you come back to the fiscal
 
02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
committee and say ask for some more
 
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
money it happens all the
 
02:21:31.950 --> 02:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
time all this is saying is that well
 
02:21:35.309 --> 02:21:35.319 align:start position:0%
let's have some kind of review if in
 
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
fact you reach that budget limit that's
 
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
all it's saying it's not trying to not
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
to deny
 
02:21:45.389 --> 02:21:45.399 align:start position:0%
children it's basically saying go back
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal committee give us another
 
02:21:50.270 --> 02:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
projection of how much you think you
 
02:21:50.280 --> 02:21:51.710 align:start position:0%
projection of how much you think you
might

02:21:51.710 --> 02:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
might
 
02:21:55.870 --> 02:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
need it's a simple concept
 
02:21:59.389 --> 02:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
folks you may disagree with it but there
 
02:22:02.469 --> 02:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
should be some oversight by somebody in
 
02:22:02.479 --> 02:22:03.389 align:start position:0%
should be some oversight by somebody in
this

02:22:03.389 --> 02:22:03.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
state to say where are we with I don't
 
02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
know about your budget but I on a
 
02:22:10.790 --> 02:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
monthly basis I say where are we with
 
02:22:13.230 --> 02:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
our budget are we over it are we under
 
02:22:15.750 --> 02:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
it do we need to make some
 
02:22:17.750 --> 02:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
modifications and this case the
 
02:22:19.870 --> 02:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
modifications would come from the fiscal
 
02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:29.110 --> 02:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:32.990 --> 02:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
petam would it be a good fiscally
 
02:22:36.070 --> 02:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
conservative conversation to have to
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
consider eliminating the phaseout grants
 
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
to the public schools that come along
 
02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:46.160 align:start position:0%

whitcock thank you Mr chair um one of
 
02:22:54.429 --> 02:22:54.439 align:start position:0%
the things we talk about is is the the
 
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
the uh program how educationally solid
 
02:22:59.230 --> 02:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
is and based and and I'm just looking at
 
02:23:02.750 --> 02:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
the the uh print
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
out some of the expenses because we
 
02:23:07.550 --> 02:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to deny any education here

some balance here we talking about got
 
02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
to educate the kids educate the kids
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
$5,000 we're up to 30 $30 million right
 
02:23:46.910 --> 02:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
now and that's a long rip that's just
 
02:23:49.150 --> 02:23:49.160 align:start position:0%
one list came from the from the
 
02:23:52.429 --> 02:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
organization uh of some of these
 
02:23:53.950 --> 02:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
expenses so I mean when we think about
 
02:23:55.950 --> 02:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
what we using for educational money I
 
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
think there has to be some some because
 
02:23:58.710 --> 02:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
you sure wouldn't do that with your
 
02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
money at your home thank you thank you
 
02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
very much representative Belcher thank
 
02:24:06.309 --> 02:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and I'll be the first one
 
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
to admit that usually when we do things
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
in politics name bills and whatnot you
 
02:24:11.230 --> 02:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
usually look to the opposite of what
 
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
it's called to learn what it does but I
 
02:24:15.269 --> 02:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
think this one's a bit of an exception
 
02:24:17.349 --> 02:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account actually
 
02:24:20.830 --> 02:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
gives parents the freedom to choose what
 
02:24:23.429 --> 02:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
they're going to do when you give people
 
02:24:25.309 --> 02:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
Freedom you don't know what they're
 
02:24:26.910 --> 02:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
going to do it's kind of up in the air
 
02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
so it would be impossible to foretell
 
02:24:33.550 --> 02:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
the budget for a program based on
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
freedom so I have to say if if you pass
 
02:24:38.670 --> 02:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
this bill you you might as well get the
 
02:24:42.070 --> 02:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
F out because it's no longer a freedom
 
02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
account further discussion
 
02:24:46.429 --> 02:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden um just for
 
02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
clarify ification um for those who don't
 
02:24:52.910 --> 02:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
know um I mean education Freedom
 
02:24:55.230 --> 02:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
accounts were not around when I was a
 
02:24:58.510 --> 02:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
school principal and then when I was a
 
02:25:01.349 --> 02:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
superintendent they came around but you
 
02:25:03.830 --> 02:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
need to know because you obviously don't
 
02:25:06.309 --> 02:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
know that with or without education
 
02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts parents always had
 
02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:11.870 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts parents always had
choice

02:25:11.870 --> 02:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
choice
 
02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
always I I sometimes told parent move to
 
02:25:17.950 --> 02:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
the next town if you don't like it
 
02:25:21.670 --> 02:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
or write me a note in home school but if
 
02:25:23.830 --> 02:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
there was any other type of school or
 
02:25:25.990 --> 02:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
program or any type of educational
 
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
environment the parent has the choice
 
02:25:34.269 --> 02:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
and always did so please stop referring
 
02:25:36.349 --> 02:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
as education Freedom accounts which is
 
02:25:41.230 --> 02:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
public dollars for private use as losing
 
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
parent choice because they're not losing
 
02:25:46.110 --> 02:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
it they've always had it it's just who
 
02:25:48.269 --> 02:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
pays for it
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative perinel yes thank
 
02:25:53.349 --> 02:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
you um representative cascaden did you
 
02:25:55.910 --> 02:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
say that Parents Choice was that they
 
02:25:59.469 --> 02:25:59.479 align:start position:0%
had to move to attend a different
 
02:26:02.070 --> 02:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
school do you want me answer represent
 
02:26:04.630 --> 02:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
kcan if you want to we we only had one
 
02:26:07.269 --> 02:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
school in our district and if parents
 
02:26:09.389 --> 02:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
didn't like the rules and they wanted to
 
02:26:11.750 --> 02:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
change the rules and say well maybe
 
02:26:14.309 --> 02:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
you'd be better served in another town
 
02:26:16.990 --> 02:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
followup yes so are you saying there
 
02:26:19.190 --> 02:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
constrained by the zip code in which
 
02:26:21.230 --> 02:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
they live they can't you couldn't
 
02:26:23.309 --> 02:26:23.319 align:start position:0%
tuition them out to a school that would
 
02:26:25.870 --> 02:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
suit their needs better depends on the
 
02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
situation always of tuition to other
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
Public Schools but parents have the
 
02:26:32.750 --> 02:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
choice as the ultimate bottom
 
02:26:35.630 --> 02:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
line representative cordelli thank you I
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
would just say that U I don't think that
 
02:26:43.510 --> 02:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
all parents have a choice um in effect
 
02:26:45.790 --> 02:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
we have uh ZIP code
 
02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:47.469 align:start position:0%
we have uh ZIP code
discrimination

02:26:47.469 --> 02:26:47.479 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
02:26:47.479 --> 02:26:50.070 align:start position:0%
discrimination
um

02:26:50.070 --> 02:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:54.269 --> 02:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
um some parents with financial means can
 
02:26:57.030 --> 02:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
certainly move to a different uh
 
02:26:59.469 --> 02:26:59.479 align:start position:0%
neighborhood where maybe there is a a
 
02:27:02.190 --> 02:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
better performing school with better
 
02:27:07.550 --> 02:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
proficiency rates um uh I read a book um
 
02:27:10.510 --> 02:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
called redlining that showed a number of
 
02:27:13.830 --> 02:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
major cities um Chicago Los Angeles and
 
02:27:16.190 --> 02:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
it was very interesting to look at the
 
02:27:17.469 --> 02:27:17.479 align:start position:0%
red line
 
02:27:20.990 --> 02:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
um of districts for bank loans that used
 
02:27:23.950 --> 02:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
to be in effect and how School District
 
02:27:26.110 --> 02:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
boundaries matched with those redlining
 
02:27:29.510 --> 02:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
districts it was fascinating to look at
 
02:27:32.750 --> 02:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh in that same book there was a
 
02:27:35.950 --> 02:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
story um about the author's brother
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to move to uh Chicago and looked
 
02:27:41.750 --> 02:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
at found a beautiful home on the north
 
02:27:43.710 --> 02:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
side of North Avenue in
 
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
Chicago but then discovered the
 
02:27:48.349 --> 02:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
proficiency rates were in the
 
02:27:48.359 --> 02:27:50.030 align:start position:0%
proficiency rates were in the
30%

02:27:50.030 --> 02:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
30%
 
02:27:53.190 --> 02:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
range went to the other side of North
 
02:27:55.309 --> 02:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
Avenue where there was a a low
 
02:27:55.319 --> 02:27:56.469 align:start position:0%
Avenue where there was a a low
performing

02:27:56.469 --> 02:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
performing
 
02:27:56.479 --> 02:27:58.389 align:start position:0%
performing
school

02:27:58.389 --> 02:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:28:00.670 --> 02:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
um excuse me it was the other way around
 
02:28:02.830 --> 02:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
he found a low performing School a house
 
02:28:05.110 --> 02:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
that he loved went to the other side of
 
02:28:08.630 --> 02:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
the U North Avenue and where there was
 
02:28:12.309 --> 02:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
um uh a better performing school but the
 
02:28:14.110 --> 02:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
house was a quarter of a million dollars
 
02:28:16.190 --> 02:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
more and it wasn't even one that they
 
02:28:17.429 --> 02:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
really like
 
02:28:21.670 --> 02:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
but had to move or select the higher
 
02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
priced home in order to get a free and
 
02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:26.750 align:start position:0%
priced home in order to get a free and
appropriate

02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:28:32.110 --> 02:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
education um sure some parents can um
 
02:28:34.870 --> 02:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
elect a homeschool but not all parents
 
02:28:36.990 --> 02:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
that does not fit with every every
 
02:28:39.870 --> 02:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
parent situation a single mother is
 
02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
going to have a hard time um uh
 
02:28:47.750 --> 02:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
homeschooling so um I uh I don't agree
 
02:28:51.070 --> 02:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
with that argument um in the least um
 
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
and I think that um education Freedom
 
02:28:59.830 --> 02:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
accounts um are well-named
 
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
and try to
 
02:29:06.590 --> 02:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
address the um maybe the shortcomings in
 
02:29:09.990 --> 02:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
the current system in terms of zip code
 
02:29:13.070 --> 02:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination but also in terms of uh
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
performance of some
 
02:29:18.910 --> 02:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
schools representative Miler yeah thank
 
02:29:21.389 --> 02:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair the latter part of this
 
02:29:23.550 --> 02:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
conversation is very interesting but I
 
02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
want to bring us back to the
 
02:29:29.710 --> 02:29:29.720 align:start position:0%
focus focus of this bill is staying
 
02:29:32.349 --> 02:29:32.359 align:start position:0%
within the budget amount that's all it
 
02:29:34.990 --> 02:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
is we can have the other conversation
 
02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
about zip codes and accesss and all that
 
02:29:41.630 --> 02:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
stuff this bill focuses on do you want
 
02:29:45.349 --> 02:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
the program to stay within the budget if
 
02:29:48.630 --> 02:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
you do you You' vote for it knowing full
 
02:29:50.830 --> 02:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
well that if you go over the budget you
 
02:29:53.469 --> 02:29:53.479 align:start position:0%
can come back and ask for more
 
02:29:56.269 --> 02:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
money it's a simple Bill
 
02:29:58.910 --> 02:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
folks yes or
 
02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
leus well given that we went over over
 
02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
budget uh the last few years I would say
 
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
that we do a terrible job of budgeting
 
02:30:16.110 --> 02:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
for a highly popular program and perhaps
 
02:30:20.190 --> 02:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
we should budget more money
 
02:30:24.389 --> 02:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
great further discussion representa
 
02:30:27.830 --> 02:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
Damon reflecting on representative lakus
 
02:30:30.830 --> 02:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
remarks yes we should do a better job of
 
02:30:34.110 --> 02:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
budgeting and this is to that end it
 
02:30:37.150 --> 02:30:37.160 align:start position:0%
would increase transparency on the cost
 
02:30:39.990 --> 02:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
of the education Freedom account
 
02:30:44.389 --> 02:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
program I frankly do not understand in a
 
02:30:44.399 --> 02:30:45.429 align:start position:0%
program I frankly do not understand in a
time

02:30:45.429 --> 02:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:30:49.710 --> 02:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
when all of my constituents and I would
 
02:30:52.590 --> 02:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
expect most people's constituents are
 
02:30:54.590 --> 02:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the way the state
 
02:30:56.990 --> 02:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
is spending money and what their taxes
 
02:31:01.110 --> 02:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
are why wouldn't we want to be
 
02:31:03.670 --> 02:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
transparent set the limit have to come
 
02:31:05.630 --> 02:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
back and ask fiscal for more money if
 
02:31:07.830 --> 02:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
that were needed I fully support this
 
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
bill so I I've got a question for every
 
02:31:14.550 --> 02:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
if if we're capping here on this program
 
02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
should we be capping our Public School
 
02:31:17.910 --> 02:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
hey we've already reached our limit in
 
02:31:19.550 --> 02:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
the public school so you're going to
 
02:31:21.630 --> 02:31:21.640 align:start position:0%
have to go find another school elsewhere
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
to go to school we actually do we do
 
02:31:27.230 --> 02:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
based on the prior year number no I'm
 
02:31:28.790 --> 02:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
not talking about that I'm talking about
 
02:31:31.550 --> 02:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
the student that arrives at the doors is
 
02:31:32.950 --> 02:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
that student
 
02:31:36.990 --> 02:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
rejected never never never never so why
 
02:31:39.429 --> 02:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
should a student be rejected from this
 
02:31:41.630 --> 02:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
program as
 
02:31:44.870 --> 02:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
well represent
 
02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you
 
02:31:48.630 --> 02:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
because public schools are a
 
02:31:50.309 --> 02:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirement and they
 
02:31:52.269 --> 02:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
educate all students and it's not one
 
02:31:54.950 --> 02:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.469 --> 02:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
all represent
 
02:31:59.429 --> 02:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you I just want to
 
02:32:01.590 --> 02:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
respond to the budget question I I agree
 
02:32:04.230 --> 02:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
with representative Lakers that we've
 
02:32:06.670 --> 02:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
done a horrible job budgeting the
 
02:32:08.910 --> 02:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education gave us the
 
02:32:11.070 --> 02:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
initial number of
 
02:32:13.750 --> 02:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
129,000 and that's what we used and we
 
02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
spent 8
 
02:32:18.469 --> 02:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
million that's all I mean we start what
 
02:32:22.190 --> 02:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
the commissioner told us thank you
 
02:32:22.200 --> 02:32:23.389 align:start position:0%
the commissioner told us thank you
represent

02:32:23.389 --> 02:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:32:28.030 --> 02:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
dry thank you um I because I wanted to
 
02:32:32.110 --> 02:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
ask how if we went over budget a warrant
 
02:32:34.110 --> 02:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
would draw money from the education
 
02:32:37.309 --> 02:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
trust fund if we've taken out the part
 
02:32:39.670 --> 02:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
that says if regardless of the balance
 
02:32:42.590 --> 02:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
of funds available in that fund and made
 
02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
it specifically tied to a number at the
 
02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
bottom bot for this year a physical
 
02:32:51.349 --> 02:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
number and for subsequent years an
 
02:32:56.030 --> 02:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:00.269 --> 02:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
yet represent cordelli um thank you um
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
the original budget for this
 
02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
program um was based on the takeup rate
 
02:33:10.710 --> 02:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
if you will of um uh students in other
 
02:33:13.790 --> 02:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
states um I think was maybe six states
 
02:33:16.830 --> 02:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
that had similar programs at that point
 
02:33:19.550 --> 02:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
um so that's what the uh original budget
 
02:33:23.030 --> 02:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
was based on but you have to factor in
 
02:33:26.150 --> 02:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
that this started up after the
 
02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic after the pandemic when schools
 
02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
were closed when parents saw what was
 
02:33:35.190 --> 02:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
going on through remote learning and
 
02:33:40.349 --> 02:33:40.359 align:start position:0%
some were not happy so I think it was um
 
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
totally um uh understandable that the
 
02:33:46.469 --> 02:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
takeup rate in New Hampshire might have
 
02:33:49.150 --> 02:33:49.160 align:start position:0%
been higher than originally projected
 
02:33:51.950 --> 02:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
because it was coming after the pandemic
 
02:33:53.950 --> 02:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
and just uh point about the fiscal
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
committee I remember um maybe five or
 
02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
six years ago when um uh we got a grant
 
02:34:06.309 --> 02:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
of $40 million for uh Charter
 
02:34:08.790 --> 02:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
Schools it had to be accepted by the
 
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee before the education
 
02:34:13.469 --> 02:34:13.479 align:start position:0%
department could do anything with it
 
02:34:16.830 --> 02:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
well guess what uh one party in the
 
02:34:20.550 --> 02:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
majority at that point kept tabling
 
02:34:23.150 --> 02:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
acceptance of that $40 million Federal
 
02:34:27.030 --> 02:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
grant month after ma month until a new
 
02:34:29.710 --> 02:34:29.720 align:start position:0%
party became the majority and that
 
02:34:33.389 --> 02:34:33.399 align:start position:0%
Federal grant was accepted so um you
 
02:34:36.110 --> 02:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
know relying on the fiscal committee to
 
02:34:39.710 --> 02:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
say uh yes I think is a dicey
 
02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
proposition and I can even further go
 
02:34:43.550 --> 02:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
back in memory and remember when charter
 
02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
school started here we had $10 million
 
02:34:47.950 --> 02:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
sitting in a pot to help with lease
 
02:34:50.269 --> 02:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
costs and all that for
 
02:34:54.830 --> 02:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
Charters and folks refuse to go to that
 
02:34:57.870 --> 02:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
pot I can remember that solidly sitting
 
02:35:00.070 --> 02:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
there in the governor's office talking
 
02:35:06.269 --> 02:35:06.279 align:start position:0%
about this represent dry yes I dry first
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you this isn't the qu answer to
 
02:35:11.790 --> 02:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
the question that I'm asking I'm asking
 
02:35:15.309 --> 02:35:15.319 align:start position:0%
here if we go over the budget this year
 
02:35:16.550 --> 02:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
then we're supposed to back to the
 
02:35:18.349 --> 02:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee to ask for a warrant to
 
02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
get to go over the budget but the bud
 
02:35:23.389 --> 02:35:23.399 align:start position:0%
the warrant for that payment shall not
 
02:35:28.110 --> 02:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
exceed 19,800 th000 so where do we get
 
02:35:30.150 --> 02:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
the over budget from if we're not
 
02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to go beyond that
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
point repr sen luno thank you Mr chair
 
02:35:39.510 --> 02:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
and the um the the Democratic majority
 
02:35:42.550 --> 02:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
on the fisal committee uh back four
 
02:35:45.070 --> 02:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
years ago when uh when those when the
 
02:35:45.080 --> 02:35:47.030 align:start position:0%
years ago when uh when those when the
expanded

02:35:47.030 --> 02:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
expanded
 
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh the charter expansion grants were uh
 
02:35:52.469 --> 02:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
were were not approved was absolutely
 
02:35:54.030 --> 02:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do we just saw a
 
02:35:57.269 --> 02:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
charter go go absolutely insolvent due
 
02:36:00.469 --> 02:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
to fraud uh after having taken and I
 
02:36:03.309 --> 02:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
forgot the number I think it's $1.4
 
02:36:06.389 --> 02:36:06.399 align:start position:0%
million of that of that Federal grant
 
02:36:08.429 --> 02:36:08.439 align:start position:0%
it's probably in somebody's pocket we
 
02:36:10.790 --> 02:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
don't know but uh but they went they
 
02:36:14.630 --> 02:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
went in solement in solement with um uh
 
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
after taking um taxpayer money so
 
02:36:21.230 --> 02:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
without guard rails like this bill does
 
02:36:24.830 --> 02:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
without guard rails like what the um
 
02:36:27.950 --> 02:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
like what the uh The Joint um uh fiscal
 
02:36:30.550 --> 02:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
committe committee is supposed to do
 
02:36:32.630 --> 02:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
this is the type of stuff that happens
 
02:36:35.870 --> 02:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
fraud and misuse and unfortunately the
 
02:36:38.830 --> 02:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
majority in charge right now apparently
 
02:36:42.349 --> 02:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
is allowing that to happen and uh what
 
02:36:44.670 --> 02:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
we saw with with the with the the
 
02:36:46.750 --> 02:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
finance committee when waving on even
 
02:36:49.950 --> 02:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
taking a look at what uh what expanding
 
02:36:52.389 --> 02:36:52.399 align:start position:0%
the voucher program would cost state
 
02:36:56.830 --> 02:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers is just endemic of what is um
 
02:36:58.070 --> 02:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
what is happening under the current
 
02:37:00.990 --> 02:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
majority thank you I want to clarify
 
02:37:03.150 --> 02:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
that the the majority did not allow that
 
02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
to occur the majority when they found
 
02:37:08.830 --> 02:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
out that this was going on it was
 
02:37:11.070 --> 02:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
stopped represent
 
02:37:14.110 --> 02:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
dry okay I'm G to ask for a third time
 
02:37:18.030 --> 02:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
if we go over the budget this year
 
02:37:20.590 --> 02:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be able to ask for a
 
02:37:23.950 --> 02:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
warrant to cover that but I don't see
 
02:37:27.469 --> 02:37:27.479 align:start position:0%
that in this line six to line 12 such
 
02:37:30.230 --> 02:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
warrant for payment shall not exceed
 
02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:39.150 --> 02:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
question represent Tanner I'm afraid I'm
 
02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
not going to answer your question but
 
02:37:43.309 --> 02:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call for the vote I think

we've beat this to death
 
02:37:49.269 --> 02:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion because
 
02:37:51.349 --> 02:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
the rule state we cannot call a vote
 
02:37:52.830 --> 02:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
like that if there's further discussion
 
02:37:56.070 --> 02:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to have it represent
 
02:38:00.910 --> 02:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you represent lad um I
 
02:38:03.750 --> 02:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
just wanted to respond to uh
 
02:38:06.670 --> 02:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
representative Celli's statement not
 
02:38:08.110 --> 02:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
that I haven't done already a couple
 
02:38:11.070 --> 02:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
times today um what one more when you
 
02:38:13.790 --> 02:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
said parents no one was happy with the
 
02:38:18.590 --> 02:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
schools and they uh went wanted the
 
02:38:22.349 --> 02:38:22.359 align:start position:0%
uh budgeting for the EA during remote
 
02:38:24.269 --> 02:38:24.279 align:start position:0%
during the remote
 
02:38:27.070 --> 02:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
period and Glenn I agree with you I
 
02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
don't think any parents in New Hampshire
 
02:38:31.070 --> 02:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
were happy with remote learning during
 
02:38:34.550 --> 02:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
covid but that was a crisis and no one
 
02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
the ones I looked on was not happy
 
02:38:37.469 --> 02:38:37.479 align:start position:0%
that's for sure of looking on that
 
02:38:40.510 --> 02:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
little screen trying to teach at home so
 
02:38:42.630 --> 02:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
I I agree with you 100% on that but it
 
02:38:44.670 --> 02:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with the EFA going
 
02:38:47.070 --> 02:38:47.080 align:start position:0%

girl otherwise I'd have nothing going
 
03:29:34.389 --> 03:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
for me and the boy who was afraid that
 
03:29:37.030 --> 03:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
he would beat up his best friend who was
 
03:29:39.550 --> 03:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
a girl because all boys were
 
03:29:42.510 --> 03:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
oppressors and
 
03:29:46.750 --> 03:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot of those things prior to
 
03:29:48.790 --> 03:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
this law being
 
03:29:53.510 --> 03:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
passed I don't hear those now like I did
 
03:29:57.150 --> 03:29:57.160 align:start position:0%
then I do hear other things that are
 
03:30:01.990 --> 03:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
more subtle but those straight out
 
03:30:05.070 --> 03:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
racist all whites are racist all boys
 
03:30:07.870 --> 03:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
are oppressors I do I have not been
 
03:30:10.710 --> 03:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
hearing those like I did before this law
 
03:30:13.950 --> 03:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
was passed so I would hate to see this
 
03:30:17.469 --> 03:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
repealed and go back to where we were
 
03:30:19.830 --> 03:30:19.840 align:start position:0%

03:30:19.840 --> 03:30:21.349 align:start position:0%

03:30:21.349 --> 03:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:30:24.389 --> 03:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
forell thank you Mr chair so um when I
 
03:30:26.510 --> 03:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
read this I was like H this sounds
 
03:30:28.349 --> 03:30:28.359 align:start position:0%
familiar and the reason being is it's
 
03:30:29.510 --> 03:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
asking for the repeal of the
 
03:30:32.110 --> 03:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination law just like hp61
 
03:30:35.710 --> 03:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
last year which I was very um opposed to
 
03:30:39.750 --> 03:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
and my arguments are the same now um
 
03:30:42.070 --> 03:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
what in the
 
03:30:45.429 --> 03:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
uh the current law is objectionable I
 
03:30:47.670 --> 03:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
pointed out when we had the hearing I
 
03:30:51.590 --> 03:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
asked a question about my big problem
 
03:30:54.790 --> 03:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
with this is the wording it's really um
 
03:30:57.110 --> 03:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
disturbing in a way it says basically
 
03:30:59.070 --> 03:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
you can engage engage in any form of
 
03:31:00.990 --> 03:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
instruction just that phrase any form of
 
03:31:03.229 --> 03:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
instruction troubles me greatly all the
 
03:31:04.990 --> 03:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
guard rails has been taken away and I've
 
03:31:09.710 --> 03:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
heard anecdotes about uh students uh
 
03:31:12.630 --> 03:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
coming home and you know uh feeling as
 
03:31:15.790 --> 03:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
if they they you know Mommy I you know m
 
03:31:17.630 --> 03:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
a racist you know I could go on with
 
03:31:20.670 --> 03:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
anecdotes anecdotes prove nothing but um
 
03:31:24.150 --> 03:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
instruction that makes a child feel that
 
03:31:26.790 --> 03:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
way should not be acceptable and the
 
03:31:29.469 --> 03:31:29.479 align:start position:0%
other thing was that teaching uh this
 
03:31:34.469 --> 03:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
law makes people uh teachers
 
03:31:37.389 --> 03:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
feel hesitant to teach certain things
 
03:31:40.710 --> 03:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
and I have been a teacher I taught and I
 
03:31:42.630 --> 03:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
think bought this up last year um
 
03:31:45.030 --> 03:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
teaching slave narratives um I never
 
03:31:48.150 --> 03:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
felt like anything you know I this
 
03:31:49.630 --> 03:31:49.640 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination law going into
 
03:31:51.349 --> 03:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
effect if I was to go back and teach
 
03:31:53.349 --> 03:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
again nothing would change in the way I
 
03:31:55.349 --> 03:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
would teach I thought it was ironic that
 
03:31:56.990 --> 03:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
one of the speakers mentioned tequila
 
03:31:58.550 --> 03:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
mocking bir that happens to be the book
 
03:32:00.389 --> 03:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
I selected for the book club I run at my
 
03:32:02.630 --> 03:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
library I have no problems I have no
 
03:32:06.349 --> 03:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
concerns about covering that book um I
 
03:32:09.870 --> 03:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:12.469 --> 03:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
are if you know I don't know what's
 
03:32:15.110 --> 03:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
objectional about these in in the so why
 
03:32:18.550 --> 03:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
would we repeal a law then I'll let
 
03:32:19.990 --> 03:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
other people speak their peace that's
 
03:32:23.830 --> 03:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
mine thank you you're welcome represent
 
03:32:26.990 --> 03:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you um first of all I'd
 
03:32:29.790 --> 03:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
like to say that uh over my years of
 
03:32:31.710 --> 03:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
teaching there probably were kids that
 
03:32:36.110 --> 03:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
went home and um had misconceptions
 
03:32:37.950 --> 03:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
about what happened in class I remember
 
03:32:41.389 --> 03:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
one class I I said to one girl that she
 
03:32:44.670 --> 03:32:44.680 align:start position:0%
was being obstructor that day and uh the
 
03:32:46.790 --> 03:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
next day her her mother called and was
 
03:32:48.590 --> 03:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
all upset you know what was I calling
 
03:32:50.389 --> 03:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
her daughter because she didn't
 
03:32:52.229 --> 03:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
understand what the word was it's a
 
03:32:54.830 --> 03:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
teachable moment kids are going to go
 
03:32:56.710 --> 03:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
home with misconceptions over what
 
03:32:59.070 --> 03:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
happens in a classroom and if they bring
 
03:33:01.110 --> 03:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
it to a parent that's a teachable moment
 
03:33:02.990 --> 03:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
for the parent it's also a time for the
 
03:33:05.469 --> 03:33:05.479 align:start position:0%
parent to talk about values if it's a
 
03:33:08.070 --> 03:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
delicate subject and sometimes in health
 
03:33:11.790 --> 03:33:11.800 align:start position:0%
class we actually had um projects where
 
03:33:13.550 --> 03:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
kids had to go home or had to talk to
 
03:33:16.110 --> 03:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
other people uh about certain things so
 
03:33:19.189 --> 03:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
that they got uh a different view so
 
03:33:21.189 --> 03:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's one side of it on the
 
03:33:23.910 --> 03:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
teaching side of it I've talked to
 
03:33:26.870 --> 03:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
several teachers who have been called up
 
03:33:30.150 --> 03:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
on this particular Bill who have been
 
03:33:34.070 --> 03:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
taken out of an AP class the day before
 
03:33:35.429 --> 03:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
the AP
 
03:33:38.030 --> 03:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
exam uh not allowed to prep for her
 
03:33:39.870 --> 03:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
students because she was under
 
03:33:43.269 --> 03:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
investigation ation the investigation
 
03:33:43.279 --> 03:33:45.189 align:start position:0%
investigation ation the investigation
proved

03:33:45.189 --> 03:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
proved
 
03:33:48.269 --> 03:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
unfounded um goes back into that class
 
03:33:50.309 --> 03:33:50.319 align:start position:0%
and imagine a teacher going back into
 
03:33:54.510 --> 03:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
the class not knowing who actually was
 
03:33:56.710 --> 03:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
offended not knowing not being able to
 
03:33:59.030 --> 03:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
talk if it was a student about what the
 
03:34:01.870 --> 03:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
teachable moment was and and what the
 
03:34:04.870 --> 03:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding was knowing that the
 
03:34:06.429 --> 03:34:06.439 align:start position:0%
rest of the people in the school also
 
03:34:08.950 --> 03:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
knew that she was under investigation
 
03:34:11.830 --> 03:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
realizing that this that somebody in the
 
03:34:14.590 --> 03:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
classroom could actually use it as a as
 
03:34:18.790 --> 03:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
a ploy or as a as a I don't know
 
03:34:20.830 --> 03:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
retaliation would be the right point to
 
03:34:22.670 --> 03:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
put it but let's say they were unhappy
 
03:34:24.670 --> 03:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
with their grade or something and and
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
decided to to turn the teacher in we've
 
03:34:30.830 --> 03:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
heard stories antidotal stories of the
 
03:34:32.349 --> 03:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Education actually
 
03:34:35.790 --> 03:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
instituting challenges within schools um
 
03:34:38.590 --> 03:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
to say that teachers aren't affected by
 
03:34:41.229 --> 03:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
this is crazy
 
03:34:42.710 --> 03:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
um all you have to do is go out there
 
03:34:45.910 --> 03:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
and talk to the public school uh people
 
03:34:48.710 --> 03:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
to know how this bill is affecting
 
03:34:50.590 --> 03:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
particularly social studies teachers but
 
03:34:54.710 --> 03:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
also other teachers and you know I am
 
03:34:56.830 --> 03:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
frustrated with the
 
03:34:59.590 --> 03:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
constant um approach of this this
 
03:35:01.510 --> 03:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
committee the bills that we're getting
 
03:35:02.950 --> 03:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
in this committee not the committee
 
03:35:04.389 --> 03:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
itself but the bills we're getting in
 
03:35:10.150 --> 03:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
this committee that try to try to put
 
03:35:13.189 --> 03:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
not just guardrails but jail sales
 
03:35:15.070 --> 03:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
around teachers about what they can
 
03:35:17.189 --> 03:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
teach when they can teach and they're
 
03:35:19.110 --> 03:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
professionals we're professionals we've
 
03:35:21.750 --> 03:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
been trained and if somebody is
 
03:35:24.550 --> 03:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
violating something um and I think this
 
03:35:25.590 --> 03:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
was brought up in one of the
 
03:35:27.309 --> 03:35:27.319 align:start position:0%
testimonials if somebody's violating
 
03:35:29.670 --> 03:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
something then they're dealt with on the
 
03:35:31.510 --> 03:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
local level and they can be dealt with
 
03:35:33.950 --> 03:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
with the school board um we're not
 
03:35:36.990 --> 03:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
making laws for one or two antidotal
 
03:35:39.950 --> 03:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
situations so um I think it's time this
 
03:35:43.030 --> 03:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
this bill goes into the trash can thank
 
03:35:46.469 --> 03:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
you further discussion represent
 
03:35:48.630 --> 03:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair and there's
 
03:35:50.750 --> 03:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
already been a lot of talk about the the
 
03:35:52.830 --> 03:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
the school topic here and and what
 
03:35:53.950 --> 03:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
children are being taught but I want to
 
03:35:55.469 --> 03:35:55.479 align:start position:0%
look for a moment at the other aspect of
 
03:35:57.150 --> 03:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
this which is workplace
 
03:35:59.950 --> 03:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
training uh right now from coast to
 
03:36:03.309 --> 03:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
coast there are a plethora of lawsuits
 
03:36:05.510 --> 03:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
ongoing based on these sorts of
 
03:36:07.150 --> 03:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
anti-racism and other trainings that are
 
03:36:10.590 --> 03:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
being done and there have been rulings
 
03:36:12.750 --> 03:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
suggesting that they may be violative of
 
03:36:15.469 --> 03:36:15.479 align:start position:0%
the Civil Rights Act so by repealing
 
03:36:17.189 --> 03:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
this and going back to this sort of
 
03:36:18.349 --> 03:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
thing Not only would I believe it will
 
03:36:19.590 --> 03:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
be discriminatory but I think it would
 
03:36:22.349 --> 03:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
be opening us up to a substantial amount
 
03:36:24.590 --> 03:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
of litigation and possibly millions and
 
03:36:27.950 --> 03:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars of liability thanks
 
03:36:30.910 --> 03:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
03:36:32.830 --> 03:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman lad and
 
03:36:35.550 --> 03:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
welcome back from lunch
 
03:36:38.030 --> 03:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
uh I have some notes in this paper one
 
03:36:40.510 --> 03:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
was from my associate used to set to my
 
03:36:43.229 --> 03:36:43.239 align:start position:0%
left representative Ford and he made the
 
03:36:45.870 --> 03:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
comment he said we need to teach
 
03:36:48.750 --> 03:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
complete history is important right now
 
03:36:50.990 --> 03:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
we're only doing the clipboard use of
 
03:36:53.550 --> 03:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
history and one of the other parts we
 
03:36:54.710 --> 03:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
talking about having taught social
 
03:36:56.950 --> 03:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
studies for a few years one of the other
 
03:36:59.429 --> 03:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
testimonies we had if you recall we had
 
03:37:01.229 --> 03:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
a history teacher specialist sitting
 
03:37:03.910 --> 03:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
there saying to us we can teach the what
 
03:37:03.920 --> 03:37:05.070 align:start position:0%
there saying to us we can teach the what
when

03:37:05.070 --> 03:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
when
 
03:37:07.670 --> 03:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
where but we not this doesn't allow us
 
03:37:10.830 --> 03:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
to teach the how and the why that what's
 
03:37:13.070 --> 03:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
critical and and I I have a concern that
 
03:37:15.670 --> 03:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
we start to minimize what we can teach
 
03:37:17.710 --> 03:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
because teachers in the profession are
 
03:37:19.189 --> 03:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about what they can say and
 
03:37:21.590 --> 03:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
not say and what dialogue and and
 
03:37:23.389 --> 03:37:23.399 align:start position:0%
discourse they get and you can tell me
 
03:37:25.110 --> 03:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
teachers can teach anything they want
 
03:37:26.750 --> 03:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
the reality is they can't they're
 
03:37:29.030 --> 03:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
nervous and those Socratic dialogues
 
03:37:31.269 --> 03:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
that happen in the classroom are gone a
 
03:37:34.070 --> 03:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
miss or aai or stopped and we're we're
 
03:37:36.429 --> 03:37:36.439 align:start position:0%
actually short changing our our students
 
03:37:37.950 --> 03:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
with the law the way we have it right
 
03:37:39.990 --> 03:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
now thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:40.910 align:start position:0%
now thank you Mr chair thank you
represent

03:37:40.910 --> 03:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:37:43.950 --> 03:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chair if any of
 
03:37:45.710 --> 03:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
you have been looking at the bulk of
 
03:37:47.910 --> 03:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
email testimony we have received it
 
03:37:51.110 --> 03:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
seems that the general public is
 
03:37:53.309 --> 03:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
confused at least to the Parliamentary
 
03:37:55.790 --> 03:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
procedure regarding this bill so just a
 
03:37:57.590 --> 03:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
point of clarification for someone who
 
03:38:00.590 --> 03:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
may be watching we are talking about an
 
03:38:03.550 --> 03:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination law passed in 2021
 
03:38:07.349 --> 03:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to repeal that law the
 
03:38:10.910 --> 03:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
current motion is itl meaning you are
 
03:38:13.590 --> 03:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
against the bill and in favor of keeping
 
03:38:16.229 --> 03:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
the status quo the bill as is seems a
 
03:38:17.389 --> 03:38:17.399 align:start position:0%
bit backward so I just thought
 
03:38:20.229 --> 03:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
clarification would be needed but thank
 
03:38:23.910 --> 03:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome rep Miler thank you
 
03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I want to remind the
 
03:38:30.790 --> 03:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
committee that we had a teacher shortage
 
03:38:34.229 --> 03:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
work group that worked for almost two
 
03:38:36.750 --> 03:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
years we interviewed all kinds of people
 
03:38:38.750 --> 03:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with the various issues that are
 
03:38:41.189 --> 03:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
causing teacher shortage
 
03:38:42.269 --> 03:38:42.279 align:start position:0%
and one of the
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
telling testimonies that one day we had
 
03:38:48.389 --> 03:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
teachers come in and they basically
 
03:38:49.990 --> 03:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
focused on this
 
03:38:53.030 --> 03:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
bill they talked about how the ban
 
03:38:55.630 --> 03:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
Concepts was in fact negatively
 
03:38:58.229 --> 03:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
impacting their freedom to
 
03:39:00.510 --> 03:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
teach and as a matter of fact part of
 
03:39:03.030 --> 03:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
the recommendations of that committee
 
03:39:05.910 --> 03:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation six of that committee was
 
03:39:08.910 --> 03:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
to deal with this bill because it was
 
03:39:11.830 --> 03:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
putting a a part
 
03:39:15.950 --> 03:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
in carpet if you may or blanket over how
 
03:39:18.870 --> 03:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
they teach there's vagueness in the
 
03:39:21.030 --> 03:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
language and that vagueness in the
 
03:39:23.150 --> 03:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
language basically provides an
 
03:39:25.630 --> 03:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
uncertainty of what I can and can't say
 
03:39:26.550 --> 03:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:39:29.189 --> 03:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
classroom and so I would encourage the
 
03:39:32.189 --> 03:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
committee here to vote against the itl
 
03:39:34.830 --> 03:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
so that an alternative motion can be
 
03:39:38.309 --> 03:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
made further comments from the committee
 
03:39:38.319 --> 03:39:39.229 align:start position:0%
made further comments from the committee
represent

03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:39:42.550 --> 03:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you uh I would just
 
03:39:47.710 --> 03:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
point out um in uh section 2 line 9 uh
 
03:39:47.720 --> 03:39:49.630 align:start position:0%
point out um in uh section 2 line 9 uh
354

03:39:49.630 --> 03:39:49.640 align:start position:0%
354
 
03:39:54.189 --> 03:39:54.199 align:start position:0%
a29 um is basically right to freedom
 
03:39:56.269 --> 03:39:56.279 align:start position:0%
from discrimination in public work
 
03:39:57.670 --> 03:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
places and
 
03:39:57.680 --> 03:40:00.790 align:start position:0%
places and
education

03:40:00.790 --> 03:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:03.189 --> 03:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
so Public Work
 
03:40:06.389 --> 03:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
places will be open to discrimination
 
03:40:10.590 --> 03:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
this this um section even says nothing
 
03:40:13.590 --> 03:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
shall be construed to limit sensitivity
 
03:40:16.990 --> 03:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
training in the workplace that's
 
03:40:23.630 --> 03:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
gone um and this section also says um
 
03:40:26.429 --> 03:40:26.439 align:start position:0%
RS a29 through
 
03:40:29.349 --> 03:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
834 and the subdivision heading
 
03:40:31.150 --> 03:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
preceding them
 
03:40:35.670 --> 03:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
relative I I'm not sure what is it the
 
03:40:38.389 --> 03:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
immediate subsection why isn't the
 
03:40:41.030 --> 03:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
subsection named they're naming five
 
03:40:43.110 --> 03:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
subsections but they're saying
 
03:40:45.469 --> 03:40:45.479 align:start position:0%
subsections above that are to be
 
03:40:47.950 --> 03:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
repealed as well I I don't understand
 
03:40:49.870 --> 03:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
what the intent there
 
03:40:52.830 --> 03:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
is further
 
03:40:56.469 --> 03:40:56.479 align:start position:0%

on um February 12th uh stating the
 
03:44:17.870 --> 03:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
speaker in consultation with the house
 
03:44:20.590 --> 03:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
clerk has determined that the amendment
 
03:44:25.630 --> 03:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:28.590 --> 03:44:28.600 align:start position:0%
gerain so with with
 
03:44:32.670 --> 03:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
that um we can't take that up today
 
03:44:36.269 --> 03:44:36.279 align:start position:0%
yes this if it was part of the bill and
 
03:44:37.790 --> 03:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
it was a new
 
03:44:40.389 --> 03:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
introduction um on what grounds would
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:49.950 --> 03:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
gerain is there a ruling or they just
 
03:44:49.960 --> 03:44:51.510 align:start position:0%
gerain is there a ruling or they just
say

03:44:51.510 --> 03:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:44:55.389 --> 03:44:55.399 align:start position:0%
no the I read you the email um they read
 
03:44:58.830 --> 03:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
that they sent me um I think that um you
 
03:45:01.710 --> 03:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
know one one consideration is uh the
 
03:45:04.269 --> 03:45:04.279 align:start position:0%
amendment is dealing with an entirely
 
03:45:08.670 --> 03:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:08.680 --> 03:45:11.710 align:start position:0%
 
statute

03:45:11.710 --> 03:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:14.510 --> 03:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
and and that is what oftentimes bills or
 
03:45:17.030 --> 03:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
amendments are ruled non Germain when
 
03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
they reference a totally different
 
03:45:38.670 --> 03:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:38.680 --> 03:45:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
law

03:45:41.750 --> 03:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:44.750 --> 03:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
well un fortunately or unfortunately
 
03:45:47.870 --> 03:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
either way you want to take this is the
 
03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
decision's been made by the speaker
 
03:45:54.110 --> 03:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
and it's been ruled not
 
03:45:57.070 --> 03:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
gerain so I'm not going to allow it to
 
03:45:59.309 --> 03:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
come forward on the bill
 
03:46:02.389 --> 03:46:02.399 align:start position:0%

ago today is 20th simple math even
 
03:46:51.670 --> 03:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
Public School the 20 okay so going going
 
03:46:52.750 --> 03:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
back to that
 
03:46:55.229 --> 03:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
point just a question since then did you
 
03:46:56.830 --> 03:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
have you notified the representative
 
03:47:00.469 --> 03:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
Tanner is or the represent Woodcock this
 
03:47:03.349 --> 03:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
L of questioning is not referencing the
 
03:47:05.469 --> 03:47:05.479 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment has been ruled
 
03:47:07.469 --> 03:47:07.479 align:start position:0%
non gerain I wasn't I was exactly
 
03:47:09.790 --> 03:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
referencing questioning that as a curent
 
03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
y I would think procedural courtesy if
 
03:47:13.710 --> 03:47:13.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to do that courtesies work
 
03:47:13.720 --> 03:47:17.590 align:start position:0%
you're going to do that courtesies work
both

03:47:17.590 --> 03:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:20.269 --> 03:47:20.279 align:start position:0%
ways I I think we've had our discussion
 
03:47:20.279 --> 03:47:21.229 align:start position:0%
ways I I think we've had our discussion
right

03:47:21.229 --> 03:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:47:24.790 --> 03:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
here I I I think Mr
 
03:47:28.550 --> 03:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
chair that there is a protocol here and
 
03:47:31.030 --> 03:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
that is when the vice chair of the
 
03:47:33.550 --> 03:47:33.560 align:start position:0%
committee gets information about a
 
03:47:35.990 --> 03:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
particular bill that's not ger main it
 
03:47:38.830 --> 03:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
would seem to me it would be at least a
 
03:47:41.630 --> 03:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
s I don't know what the Mason's rule
 
03:47:43.790 --> 03:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
says about this but it would seem to me
 
03:47:46.870 --> 03:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
a sense of courtesy to at least let the
 
03:47:49.149 --> 03:47:49.159 align:start position:0%
uh maker the the prime sponsor of the
 
03:47:54.030 --> 03:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
bill the of the amendment to not notify
 
03:47:56.389 --> 03:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
them of the status of that so that a
 
03:47:58.590 --> 03:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
particular if there's a a change that
 
03:48:00.189 --> 03:48:00.199 align:start position:0%
needs to make there is time to be able
 
03:48:02.630 --> 03:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
to do that so I think it's totally
 
03:48:04.510 --> 03:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to withhold that
 
03:48:07.269 --> 03:48:07.279 align:start position:0%
information without sharing that uh with
 
03:48:09.429 --> 03:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
the Prime with the prime sponsor of the
 
03:48:12.349 --> 03:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
M and I would hope in the future that
 
03:48:15.030 --> 03:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
that protocol would be uh maintained by
 
03:48:17.910 --> 03:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
the uh leadership of this committee and
 
03:48:20.429 --> 03:48:20.439 align:start position:0%
I believe last year um on the day of the
 
03:48:22.990 --> 03:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
exec session I had two bills with
 
03:48:27.110 --> 03:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:30.429 --> 03:48:30.439 align:start position:0%
Germain okay here Mr chair would it be
 
03:48:32.990 --> 03:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate for us to hold this bill so
 
03:48:34.710 --> 03:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
that now that we have this
 
03:48:38.710 --> 03:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
information that the um uh maker of the
 
03:48:40.870 --> 03:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
amendment would have time to basically
 
03:48:43.469 --> 03:48:43.479 align:start position:0%
address this new information that's just
 
03:48:45.469 --> 03:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
come before us before we're supposed to
 
03:48:47.030 --> 03:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
vote on this
 
03:48:49.349 --> 03:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
bill I would recommend that we hold it
 
03:48:51.389 --> 03:48:51.399 align:start position:0%
so she can have at least have a chance
 
03:48:53.550 --> 03:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
to deal with this new information that's
 
03:48:55.269 --> 03:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
just come
 
03:48:57.670 --> 03:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
forth I I see no problem with that
 
03:49:00.110 --> 03:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
request we will hold this bill and bring
 
03:49:02.070 --> 03:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
the bill up for full committee
 
03:49:02.080 --> 03:49:08.070 align:start position:0%
the bill up for full committee
discussion

03:49:08.070 --> 03:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:10.590 --> 03:49:10.600 align:start position:0%
tomorrow the last bill we're going to be
 
03:49:13.950 --> 03:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:18.110 --> 03:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:21.510 --> 03:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
1382 we could all turn to 1382 that is a
 
03:49:23.870 --> 03:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
bill that deals with the military
 
03:49:26.950 --> 03:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
Compact and it references students that
 
03:49:28.189 --> 03:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
are special
 
03:49:28.199 --> 03:49:33.510 align:start position:0%
are special
education

03:49:33.510 --> 03:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:33.520 --> 03:49:38.309 align:start position:0%
 
1382

03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:38.319 --> 03:49:42.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:49:42.990 --> 03:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:44.790 --> 03:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
sort like an artillery round you bracket
 
03:49:46.710 --> 03:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
it and you'll find your page
 
03:49:46.720 --> 03:49:49.189 align:start position:0%
it and you'll find your page
eventually

03:49:49.189 --> 03:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
03:49:49.199 --> 03:49:55.349 align:start position:0%
eventually
okay

03:49:55.349 --> 03:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:00.990 --> 03:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:05.590 --> 03:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
motion okay I I'll hand the gavl over to
 
03:50:07.750 --> 03:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli uh thank you Mr
 
03:50:10.469 --> 03:50:10.479 align:start position:0%
chairman and I uh call on the chairman
 
03:50:13.269 --> 03:50:13.279 align:start position:0%
for a motion I'd like to make the
 
03:50:15.750 --> 03:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation OTP on
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:23.389 --> 03:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
second thank you uh representative
 
03:50:26.229 --> 03:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
Woodcock seconds the motion um
 
03:50:28.510 --> 03:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
discussion by the maker of the motion
 
03:50:28.520 --> 03:50:29.790 align:start position:0%
discussion by the maker of the motion
yes

03:50:29.790 --> 03:50:29.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:50:34.149 --> 03:50:34.159 align:start position:0%
um although I believe that sections one
 
03:50:38.429 --> 03:50:38.439 align:start position:0%
and two are amply answered through
 
03:50:40.070 --> 03:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
statutory language which we already have
 
03:50:43.030 --> 03:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
in the military compact I see section
 
03:50:45.269 --> 03:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
three as introducing legislation that's
 
03:50:49.110 --> 03:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
required and needed in the uh reference
 
03:50:52.269 --> 03:50:52.279 align:start position:0%
to students that are moving in that are
 
03:50:54.349 --> 03:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
military oriented students that their
 
03:50:57.510 --> 03:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
parents are in the service or actively
 
03:51:00.750 --> 03:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
serving and this deals with uh fees
 
03:51:02.229 --> 03:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
incurred by parents who are members of
 
03:51:04.269 --> 03:51:04.279 align:start position:0%
the Armed Forces shall in due process
 
03:51:06.469 --> 03:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
hearings be reimbursed by the Department
 
03:51:09.950 --> 03:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
of Education if hearing officer finds in
 
03:51:12.830 --> 03:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
favor of the parent I did not find any
 
03:51:15.710 --> 03:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
language in the compact which allowed
 
03:51:18.510 --> 03:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
that to occur so this is information I
 
03:51:21.070 --> 03:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
think it's uh appropriate that we have
 
03:51:22.990 --> 03:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
in this bill and we move it
 
03:51:26.670 --> 03:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
forward thank you um represent Woodcock
 
03:51:27.590 --> 03:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
do you want to
 
03:51:29.910 --> 03:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
comment no no chairman cell thank you
 
03:51:31.189 --> 03:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
but I do have a question for the the
 
03:51:33.590 --> 03:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
maker of the motion we get there okay
 
03:51:36.269 --> 03:51:36.279 align:start position:0%
goe with your question then thank you
 
03:51:39.750 --> 03:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
chair I just my own edification um look
 
03:51:42.790 --> 03:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
on this 26 on witness fees is there any
 
03:51:44.950 --> 03:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
how expansive is that did you know or
 
03:51:49.189 --> 03:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:51.790 --> 03:51:51.800 align:start position:0%
there no I I I couldn't tell you that
 
03:51:54.510 --> 03:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
right now um I think it's going to vary
 
03:51:56.469 --> 03:51:56.479 align:start position:0%
from situation
 
03:51:56.479 --> 03:51:58.309 align:start position:0%
from situation
situation

03:51:58.309 --> 03:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
situation
 
03:52:01.149 --> 03:52:01.159 align:start position:0%
um and I didn't see any reference to it
 
03:52:03.229 --> 03:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
in the military compact when I read that
 
03:52:08.189 --> 03:52:08.199 align:start position:0%
the other evening so I believe that's a
 
03:52:11.189 --> 03:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
a valid Amendment or valid point to be
 
03:52:12.389 --> 03:52:12.399 align:start position:0%
for us to be
 
03:52:14.710 --> 03:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
considering uh in this legislation but I
 
03:52:16.110 --> 03:52:16.120 align:start position:0%
can't give you a specific answer
 
03:52:17.950 --> 03:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
represent whitcock on what the fees
 
03:52:21.790 --> 03:52:21.800 align:start position:0%
might be I fall thank you I I appreciate
 
03:52:24.630 --> 03:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
the the bill U and the help as you know
 
03:52:28.189 --> 03:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
both on the same team um the but that I
 
03:52:29.750 --> 03:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
think it's wide it makes me nervous how
 
03:52:32.870 --> 03:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
wide open that could be that's all thank
 
03:52:36.229 --> 03:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
you and if I can follow
 
03:52:38.229 --> 03:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
quickly I think this is going to be a
 
03:52:41.990 --> 03:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
rare thing occurring in this state uh
 
03:52:45.269 --> 03:52:45.279 align:start position:0%
where people are very respectful of the
 
03:52:49.189 --> 03:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
military and um I know that as a
 
03:52:51.870 --> 03:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
principal as a principal over in Maine
 
03:52:53.429 --> 03:52:53.439 align:start position:0%
when we had somebody come in down in
 
03:52:55.110 --> 03:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
Brunswick or other
 
03:52:57.630 --> 03:52:57.640 align:start position:0%
locations they hand carry their files
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
with them they're immediately you know
 
03:53:03.030 --> 03:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
given the services they deserve
 
03:53:05.590 --> 03:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
according to the I and if there's a need
 
03:53:08.110 --> 03:53:08.120 align:start position:0%
to change that an i AP meeting is called
 
03:53:10.429 --> 03:53:10.439 align:start position:0%
to go through the proc process to do it
 
03:53:14.750 --> 03:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh correctly so uh I I I think this is
 
03:53:16.910 --> 03:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
going to be an it may be on the books
 
03:53:18.429 --> 03:53:18.439 align:start position:0%
here but I doubt very seriously if
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a lot of things
 
03:53:21.149 --> 03:53:21.159 align:start position:0%
happening in the state regarding this
 
03:53:21.159 --> 03:53:22.710 align:start position:0%
happening in the state regarding this
thank

03:53:22.710 --> 03:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:53:25.950 --> 03:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
you repent Miler thank you just a point
 
03:53:28.510 --> 03:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
of clarification my sense is as I'm
 
03:53:32.389 --> 03:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
reading this bill that if in fact um

there are
 
03:53:37.070 --> 03:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
expenses uh that a parent would have in
 
03:53:39.590 --> 03:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
pursuing this and they are are found in
 
03:53:42.670 --> 03:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
favor of the parent that the department
 
03:53:45.750 --> 03:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
not a local school district Etc would be
 
03:53:47.790 --> 03:53:47.800 align:start position:0%
paying for that is is that am I reading
 
03:53:47.800 --> 03:53:51.550 align:start position:0%
paying for that is is that am I reading
that

03:53:51.550 --> 03:53:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:54.710 --> 03:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
appropriately thank you ref
 
03:53:57.429 --> 03:53:57.439 align:start position:0%
Cornell Thank you um I remember during
 
03:54:01.189 --> 03:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
testimony um Jane B Rolo um from the
 
03:54:03.309 --> 03:54:03.319 align:start position:0%
special education administrators had a
 
03:54:07.269 --> 03:54:07.279 align:start position:0%
problem with lines 13 well 12 and 13
 
03:54:09.309 --> 03:54:09.319 align:start position:0%
about I'm notified of a students
 
03:54:10.950 --> 03:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
transfer to the district whether or not
 
03:54:13.229 --> 03:54:13.239 align:start position:0%
the district schools are in session to
 
03:54:16.469 --> 03:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
do an evaluation regarding the IEP and
 
03:54:18.510 --> 03:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
they thought the timeline might be a
 
03:54:20.149 --> 03:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
problem if someone moved into the
 
03:54:22.710 --> 03:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
district in the end of June many school
 
03:54:24.910 --> 03:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
districts aren't in session during the
 
03:54:27.910 --> 03:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
summer so that 30 days might be imposing
 
03:54:31.670 --> 03:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
a a difficult thing for them to
 
03:54:35.309 --> 03:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
do thank you represent Heath thank you
 
03:54:37.510 --> 03:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair my question is basically a
 
03:54:39.990 --> 03:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
followup um to uh representative
 
03:54:42.990 --> 03:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
Cornell's um did I I thought we were
 
03:54:45.189 --> 03:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
going to hear from and I probably wasn't
 
03:54:47.110 --> 03:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
here when it happened the dep Department
 
03:54:50.269 --> 03:54:50.279 align:start position:0%
of Education that how in fact that they
 
03:54:53.309 --> 03:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
would um implement this and make sure
 
03:54:55.550 --> 03:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
it's happening in the effective way that
 
03:54:56.870 --> 03:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:54:59.830 --> 03:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
purports um did you hear from them Mr
 
03:55:02.830 --> 03:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
chair either either
 
03:55:04.830 --> 03:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
chair which part of the bill are you
 
03:55:07.389 --> 03:55:07.399 align:start position:0%
talking about I'm talking about fing up
 
03:55:09.510 --> 03:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
on representative Cor
 
03:55:16.189 --> 03:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
um the process of um implementing a what
 
03:55:18.309 --> 03:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
this bill talks about is the hearing
 
03:55:21.790 --> 03:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
process following up the timeline a lot
 
03:55:24.469 --> 03:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
of the things that are listed in this
 
03:55:24.479 --> 03:55:26.590 align:start position:0%
of the things that are listed in this
request

03:55:26.590 --> 03:55:26.600 align:start position:0%
request
 
03:55:29.750 --> 03:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
require an um really an abbreviated
 
03:55:32.990 --> 03:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
timeline um which needs to be promptly
 
03:55:35.830 --> 03:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
acted upon which as um representative
 
03:55:38.189 --> 03:55:38.199 align:start position:0%
Cornell mentioned that it were to occur
 
03:55:39.349 --> 03:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
during the sum
 
03:55:40.950 --> 03:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
I think if somebody from the Department
 
03:55:44.349 --> 03:55:44.359 align:start position:0%
of Ed um have they been brought into
 
03:55:46.189 --> 03:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
this conversation and have they
 
03:55:49.469 --> 03:55:49.479 align:start position:0%
responded in terms of how they would
 
03:55:51.510 --> 03:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
implement this because we have a
 
03:55:54.030 --> 03:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
situation that needs to be acted upon in
 
03:55:56.349 --> 03:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
a quickly Manner and how would the
 
03:55:59.950 --> 03:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:59.960 --> 03:56:01.469 align:start position:0%
 
this

03:56:01.469 --> 03:56:01.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:56:04.630 --> 03:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
1230 I not heard I I've not heard from
 
03:56:07.030 --> 03:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
anybody and that could
 
03:56:10.630 --> 03:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
be rectified within conducted within 30
 
03:56:10.640 --> 03:56:11.950 align:start position:0%
be rectified within conducted within 30
school

03:56:11.950 --> 03:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:56:11.960 --> 03:56:15.070 align:start position:0%
school
days

03:56:15.070 --> 03:56:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:19.630 --> 03:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
simple um further
 
03:56:22.830 --> 03:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
questions represent Woodcock I'm not
 
03:56:25.590 --> 03:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
antagonist to this bill at all it's the
 
03:56:27.910 --> 03:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
the the concern and I understand the
 
03:56:31.229 --> 03:56:31.239 align:start position:0%
concern because um it was talking about
 
03:56:33.990 --> 03:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
even if the school wasn't in session um
 
03:56:37.030 --> 03:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
I think was the issue yeah I I see the
 
03:56:39.429 --> 03:56:39.439 align:start position:0%
30 days um
 
03:56:41.030 --> 03:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
the new I AP but there's a further
 
03:56:42.670 --> 03:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
concern about if the school wasn't in
 
03:56:44.950 --> 03:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
session um as L Rick said before it
 
03:56:46.510 --> 03:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
probably won't be an issue but it could
 
03:56:49.229 --> 03:56:49.239 align:start position:0%
very well be
 
03:56:52.149 --> 03:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
right there needs to be a plan yeah
 
03:56:55.710 --> 03:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
because yes line 13 Mr chair says if if
 
03:56:58.110 --> 03:56:58.120 align:start position:0%
if they're absent session uh Glenn
 
03:56:59.429 --> 03:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
whether or not the district schools are
 
03:57:01.830 --> 03:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
in session I think that was the concern
 
03:57:07.030 --> 03:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:09.349 --> 03:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
forward d
 
03:57:12.269 --> 03:57:12.279 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
03:57:16.349 --> 03:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
so um chair lad's remarked that this
 
03:57:18.429 --> 03:57:18.439 align:start position:0%
concern could be resolved if it said 30
 
03:57:20.630 --> 03:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
school days I think that we need an
 
03:57:23.710 --> 03:57:23.720 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill to say that
 
03:57:25.510 --> 03:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
representing a number of very small
 
03:57:27.070 --> 03:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
school districts where the number of
 
03:57:29.550 --> 03:57:29.560 align:start position:0%
staff to do this they don't even
 
03:57:32.990 --> 03:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily have full-time special ed
 
03:57:35.790 --> 03:57:35.800 align:start position:0%
staff if that one person is on vacation
 
03:57:37.189 --> 03:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
in the summer they're simply not
 
03:57:39.750 --> 03:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
available to do this
 
03:57:44.070 --> 03:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
um I can't vote for the bill the way it
 
03:57:48.229 --> 03:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:52.870 --> 03:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
like are there IEP Provisions that are
 
03:57:56.710 --> 03:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
provided to students who need Services
 
03:57:59.550 --> 03:57:59.560 align:start position:0%
continually throughout the summer so
 
03:58:02.790 --> 03:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
that they don't fall behind and if we
 
03:58:05.550 --> 03:58:05.560 align:start position:0%
make it 30 school
 
03:58:08.229 --> 03:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
days could that then mean that those
 
03:58:11.189 --> 03:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
stud students don't get the services
 
03:58:14.670 --> 03:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
they need when school is not in
 
03:58:17.870 --> 03:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
session the the reference you're making
 
03:58:21.870 --> 03:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
ref Le is is to receive that length a
 
03:58:24.309 --> 03:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
school year you have to identify that
 
03:58:26.990 --> 03:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
within the individual education plan
 
03:58:28.429 --> 03:58:28.439 align:start position:0%
right it would be in their plan that
 
03:58:31.269 --> 03:58:31.279 align:start position:0%
they brought with them well if it's in
 
03:58:33.269 --> 03:58:33.279 align:start position:0%
their plan coming with them then the
 
03:58:35.030 --> 03:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
school would have to provide those
 
03:58:37.590 --> 03:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
Services because it it says right within
 
03:58:40.950 --> 03:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
current law that that we follow the the
 
03:58:42.830 --> 03:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh materials being brought by the parent
 
03:58:44.550 --> 03:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
even though it may not be an official
 
03:58:48.070 --> 03:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
record those are the the that's the we
 
03:58:50.110 --> 03:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
used to call it the old 2011 file that's
 
03:58:53.189 --> 03:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
the the material which um would have to
 
03:59:01.030 --> 03:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:04.189 --> 03:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
followed further uh
 
03:59:07.030 --> 03:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
discussion I'll just point out that um I
 
03:59:12.389 --> 03:59:12.399 align:start position:0%
did receive an email from um uh Melissa
 
03:59:15.309 --> 03:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
wette who uh testified from the
 
03:59:17.790 --> 03:59:17.800 align:start position:0%
Department of uh justice the Northeast
 
03:59:21.950 --> 03:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
the aison that um after uh sitting in on
 
03:59:23.590 --> 03:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
the hearing and looking at the compact
 
03:59:26.070 --> 03:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
they are still uh the dod is still
 
03:59:28.030 --> 03:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
interested in moving forward with this
 
03:59:32.990 --> 03:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
bill um if we can and I also heard from
 
03:59:37.070 --> 03:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
um the uh Prime sponsor chairman uh Roy
 
03:59:40.429 --> 03:59:40.439 align:start position:0%
who uh worked with with the uhu uh
 
03:59:43.389 --> 03:59:43.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense must wed on this
 
03:59:47.110 --> 03:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
legislation and he uh also is um anxious
 
03:59:49.950 --> 03:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
to see it uh move forward uh to support
 
03:59:53.710 --> 03:59:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:55.710 --> 03:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
families further
 
03:59:59.790 --> 03:59:59.800 align:start position:0%
discussion yeah representative lad um
 
04:00:01.229 --> 04:00:01.239 align:start position:0%
there are many schools in the state
 
04:00:04.149 --> 04:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
which are small small schools they close
 
04:00:05.870 --> 04:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
the door and they lock up in the
 
04:00:08.070 --> 04:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
summertime uh you're not going to find
 
04:00:10.389 --> 04:00:10.399 align:start position:0%
an administrator or a principal at that
 
04:00:13.429 --> 04:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
time they're probably gone to the four
 
04:00:17.349 --> 04:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
different directions um so if if this is
 
04:00:21.309 --> 04:00:21.319 align:start position:0%
a concern and because we're at least I
 
04:00:23.830 --> 04:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
am very interested in supporting
 
04:00:26.189 --> 04:00:26.199 align:start position:0%
children of military families that need
 
04:00:28.630 --> 04:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
this type of service I would suggest
 
04:00:31.030 --> 04:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
that we not go any further with it right
 
04:00:33.630 --> 04:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
now and see if we can get some amending
 
04:00:37.030 --> 04:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
language to rectify this situation that
 
04:00:39.469 --> 04:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
uh Jane berson present presented to
 
04:00:42.790 --> 04:00:42.800 align:start position:0%

04:00:44.319 --> 04:00:47.389 align:start position:0%
know as soon as we can get that amending
language

04:00:47.389 --> 04:00:47.399 align:start position:0%

04:01:14.469 --> 04:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
the people that are helping the military
 
04:01:17.429 --> 04:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
family be coordinated so in fact the
 
04:01:19.389 --> 04:01:19.399 align:start position:0%
department of Ed should be able to
 
04:01:22.630 --> 04:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
assist in facilitating a smooth
 
04:01:26.189 --> 04:01:26.199 align:start position:0%
transition and I just somehow some way
 
04:01:28.389 --> 04:01:28.399 align:start position:0%
it seems like they should be part of the
 
04:01:31.269 --> 04:01:31.279 align:start position:0%
role of all of this I mean that's what
 
04:01:34.990 --> 04:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:38.910 --> 04:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
does thank you representative lakus
 
04:01:41.790 --> 04:01:41.800 align:start position:0%
so my question and I was thinking along
 
04:01:43.349 --> 04:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
those same
 
04:01:46.750 --> 04:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
lines um if it's a small school and they
 
04:01:49.309 --> 04:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
close up from the summer would somebody
 
04:01:53.269 --> 04:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
from the doe be able to do the necessary
 
04:01:58.149 --> 04:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
within 30 days review Etc um does it
 
04:02:01.429 --> 04:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
have to be somebody from the school I
 
04:02:04.070 --> 04:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't I know how that works
 
04:02:06.790 --> 04:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
but I I think if I'm reading it
 
04:02:09.389 --> 04:02:09.399 align:start position:0%
correctly all this required is an
 
04:02:14.510 --> 04:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:17.710 --> 04:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
right further
 
04:02:20.790 --> 04:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
comment well yeah go ahead yes chairman
 
04:02:20.800 --> 04:02:23.110 align:start position:0%
comment well yeah go ahead yes chairman
lad

04:02:23.110 --> 04:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
lad
 
04:02:26.469 --> 04:02:26.479 align:start position:0%
the the school doesn't have to have an
 
04:02:29.429 --> 04:02:29.439 align:start position:0%
evaluation they may upon receiving the
 
04:02:32.550 --> 04:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
official record recognize that IEP
 
04:02:35.309 --> 04:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
that's a current IEP and move forward
 
04:02:36.469 --> 04:02:36.479 align:start position:0%
with that
 
04:02:40.550 --> 04:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
IEP so an i an evaluation is not
 
04:02:43.750 --> 04:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to have to happen uh
 
04:02:46.950 --> 04:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
the only concern I see here if in fact
 
04:02:50.349 --> 04:02:50.359 align:start position:0%
the student has wording within the IEP
 
04:02:52.710 --> 04:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
saying that the education program will
 
04:02:56.269 --> 04:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
continue through these summer months how
 
04:02:59.630 --> 04:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
do we make sure that that is adhered to
 
04:03:02.189 --> 04:03:02.199 align:start position:0%
and I think that can be rectified if we
 
04:03:05.630 --> 04:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
can contact the director over there
 
04:03:07.710 --> 04:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
special education At Doe right now miss
 
04:03:07.720 --> 04:03:09.189 align:start position:0%
special education At Doe right now miss
f

04:03:09.189 --> 04:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
f
 
04:03:11.349 --> 04:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
and and and try to get some guidance on
 
04:03:13.990 --> 04:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
that so we can move forward with some
 
04:03:17.149 --> 04:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
amending language which rectifies this
 
04:03:18.590 --> 04:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
section of the
 
04:03:20.950 --> 04:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
bill the section we're talking about
 
04:03:22.429 --> 04:03:22.439 align:start position:0%
right here the notification and the
 
04:03:26.149 --> 04:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
evaluation etc etc but the I hope
 
04:03:28.670 --> 04:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
everybody's taken a look at the military
 
04:03:32.349 --> 04:03:32.359 align:start position:0%
compact which is on page 65 which
 
04:03:35.149 --> 04:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
specifically addresses special education
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
services we got to be in compliance with
 
04:03:37.439 --> 04:03:39.590 align:start position:0%
services we got to be in compliance with
idea

04:03:39.590 --> 04:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
idea
 
04:03:42.469 --> 04:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:46.389 --> 04:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
501 chair cordelli yes when
 
04:03:48.950 --> 04:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative lad contacts uh doe for
 
04:03:51.950 --> 04:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
that clarification is it possible we
 
04:03:53.429 --> 04:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
could fig find out a little more about
 
04:03:55.469 --> 04:03:55.479 align:start position:0%
the witness fees at the same
 
04:03:59.149 --> 04:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
time I I would expect so yeah I'm at 504
 
04:04:02.510 --> 04:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
not 501 we're talking different thank
 
04:04:05.110 --> 04:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
you yeah yeah I think that we can talk
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
to the department and the Department of
 
04:04:08.510 --> 04:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
Defense possibly as well
 
04:04:11.870 --> 04:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
um get everybody on the same page thank
 
04:04:14.469 --> 04:04:14.479 align:start position:0%
you may I ask
 
04:04:18.030 --> 04:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
the hear a question
 
04:04:21.910 --> 04:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
yeah sir um would you like to step
 
04:04:21.920 --> 04:04:23.710 align:start position:0%
yeah sir um would you like to step
forward

04:04:23.710 --> 04:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:04:23.720 --> 04:04:25.309 align:start position:0%
forward
and

04:04:25.309 --> 04:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:04:30.510 --> 04:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
Absolutely I'll do my best is it Warren
 
04:04:33.269 --> 04:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
Perry so for the record Warren Perry
 
04:04:34.750 --> 04:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
Deputy a general department of military
 
04:04:36.590 --> 04:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
Affairs and veteran services thank you
 
04:04:38.950 --> 04:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
very much I I have a question
 
04:04:41.670 --> 04:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
um your office probably works with not
 
04:04:44.070 --> 04:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
just folks in our state but communicates
 
04:04:46.910 --> 04:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
with the military compact uh situation
 
04:04:49.630 --> 04:04:49.640 align:start position:0%
throughout the country um are there any
 
04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
other states that might have this type
 
04:04:53.670 --> 04:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
of language that may have a way of
 
04:04:54.950 --> 04:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
addressing the issues we've been
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
discussing today yes there are so we we
 
04:04:59.429 --> 04:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
I our department generally focuses
 
04:05:01.149 --> 04:05:01.159 align:start position:0%
inside the state we work with the State
 
04:05:02.830 --> 04:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
Defense lay on officer Miss Melissa
 
04:05:05.590 --> 04:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
wette who who does this kind of the
 
04:05:08.990 --> 04:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
Nationwide policy uh proponency for the
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
country right so she's already she's
 
04:05:12.110 --> 04:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
indicated to me while she's watching the
 
04:05:14.750 --> 04:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
hearing uh she can't travel uh right now
 
04:05:16.630 --> 04:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
but she's watching the hearing indicated
 
04:05:18.630 --> 04:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
that uh the folks from Texas may have
 
04:05:20.469 --> 04:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
some language that would be able to help
 
04:05:22.750 --> 04:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
us kind of work through
 
04:05:26.510 --> 04:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
this that be good if she could get that
 
04:05:29.990 --> 04:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
emailed to us as quickly as possible uh
 
04:05:32.429 --> 04:05:32.439 align:start position:0%
then that we could move on it we do have
 
04:05:34.550 --> 04:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
a deadline that's middle of March I
 
04:05:35.870 --> 04:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
think probably in a couple of days we
 
04:05:37.189 --> 04:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
can have something that's ready to go
 
04:05:38.710 --> 04:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
and and the I just want to make sure
 
04:05:39.910 --> 04:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
she's watching so I just want to make
 
04:05:42.630 --> 04:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
sure that the concern is the 30 days
 
04:05:44.790 --> 04:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
over the summer is the is the biggest
 
04:05:46.510 --> 04:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
concern and how can we mitigate the
 
04:05:49.389 --> 04:05:49.399 align:start position:0%
impact of the potential for small school
 
04:05:52.070 --> 04:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
districts or having the Department of
 
04:05:54.110 --> 04:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
Education step in where smaller school
 
04:05:55.590 --> 04:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
districts couldn't is that that
 
04:05:57.429 --> 04:05:57.439 align:start position:0%
generally the conversation I hear that
 
04:06:00.590 --> 04:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
right I believe of nodded heads and
 
04:06:02.189 --> 04:06:02.199 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock you wanted
 
04:06:05.149 --> 04:06:05.159 align:start position:0%
another point to be looked at thank you
 
04:06:08.510 --> 04:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
if if this uh if they have other Lang
 
04:06:10.269 --> 04:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
that would give us more clarity on the
 
04:06:12.630 --> 04:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
witness fees portion of this uh what
 
04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
that actually like how expansive that
 
04:06:17.030 --> 04:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
could be yes sir okay thank you so she's
 
04:06:20.070 --> 04:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
texting me as as we speak so if if you
 
04:06:22.830 --> 04:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
big absolutely from other states she
 
04:06:24.269 --> 04:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
said she can get those best practices
 
04:06:25.710 --> 04:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
from the other states she's working that
 
04:06:27.750 --> 04:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
right now I don't know I she's generally
 
04:06:29.389 --> 04:06:29.399 align:start position:0%
responsive I I can't imagine it's going
 
04:06:30.670 --> 04:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
to take her to the end of the week to
 
04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
get things right thank you um pretty
 
04:06:35.950 --> 04:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
good representative Heath just one other
 
04:06:38.670 --> 04:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
thing um as a result of the actions
 
04:06:40.950 --> 04:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
being taken shouldn't a technical
 
04:06:43.550 --> 04:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
assistance be sent out to all school
 
04:06:47.110 --> 04:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
districts um and schools knowing what
 
04:06:48.790 --> 04:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
they would do in the event that a
 
04:06:51.630 --> 04:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
military family arrives with a child
 
04:06:55.750 --> 04:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
with a um an IEP so they're updated on
 
04:06:57.469 --> 04:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
all the it's only for you the school
 
04:06:59.750 --> 04:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
districts to have this information is
 
04:07:02.870 --> 04:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
that I hope that's part of the um I
 
04:07:03.790 --> 04:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
would think that that would fall into
 
04:07:05.389 --> 04:07:05.399 align:start position:0%
purview of the Department of Education
 
04:07:07.189 --> 04:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
that's exactly where it belongs we need
 
04:07:11.510 --> 04:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
to to the director and and make sure
 
04:07:13.389 --> 04:07:13.399 align:start position:0%
they follow up on it too once we can get
 
04:07:15.910 --> 04:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
some of this information back
 
04:07:19.110 --> 04:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
from great thank you very much for your
 
04:07:19.120 --> 04:07:20.750 align:start position:0%
from great thank you very much for your
help

04:07:20.750 --> 04:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
help
 
04:07:24.349 --> 04:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
um uh anything further for Mr
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
Perry seeing nothing thank you very
 
04:07:30.109 --> 04:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
much um anything further from the
 
04:07:33.590 --> 04:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
committee otherwise um we'll put this on
 
04:07:36.750 --> 04:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
hold we'll get the uh best practic
 
04:07:39.550 --> 04:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
language from other states and um see
 
04:07:43.189 --> 04:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
about amending uh
 
04:07:46.269 --> 04:07:46.279 align:start position:0%
1382 okay I think that's it
 
04:07:49.830 --> 04:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
right EXC yeah were we going to hear
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
from someone at the department about
 
04:07:54.870 --> 04:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:57.870 --> 04:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
rules explain a little bit more Cornell
 
04:08:00.269 --> 04:08:00.279 align:start position:0%
in now Federal Law requires that all
 
04:08:03.309 --> 04:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
IEPs be reviewed within 30 days anyway
 
04:08:05.349 --> 04:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's summer or not when a
 
04:08:07.349 --> 04:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
student moves into the district I think
 
04:08:07.359 --> 04:08:08.870 align:start position:0%
student moves into the district I think
so

04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:11.469 --> 04:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if this isn't I'm confused
 
04:08:13.469 --> 04:08:13.479 align:start position:0%
about if this is a problem or not no
 
04:08:16.109 --> 04:08:16.119 align:start position:0%
that's done locally um that's done when
 
04:08:18.750 --> 04:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
when a student moves in that has an IEP
 
04:08:20.670 --> 04:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
let's say it's in Speech
